Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  51  72  26  86
1  28  18   5  96  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and aim for envy-freeness in the allocation of items to agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate items in such a way that each agent feels that their allocated bundle of items is at least as good as their fair share based on their valuations. 

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [11, 51, 72, 26, 86]
- Agent 1's valuations: [28, 18, 5, 96, 63]

To find an envy-free allocation (if possible with integer items), we can use an approach such as the "adjusted winner" procedure or simply try to balance the value each agent gets as close as possible to ensure no envy. Given the constraint of integer item allocation, this problem is akin to solving a fair division problem using manual inspection or heuristic methods.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify highest value per agent**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest with a value of 86.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest with a value of 96.

2. **Allocate highest valued items**: 
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Assign remaining items**:
   - Remaining items are 0, 1, 2.
   - Agent 0's next highest valued items are 2 (72), 1 (51), and 0 (11).
   - Agent 1's next highest valued items are 4 (63), 0 (28), and 1 (18).

4. **Balancing total value**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 72 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 51 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 28 for Agent 1).

5. **Final allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [2, 4, 1] (values: 72, 86, 51)
   - Agent 1: [3, 0] (values: 96, 28)

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 1],
    "1": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents have a bundle of items that reflects their preferences as closely as possible, considering the constraint of integer allocations. Note that perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable due to the discrete nature of items and differing valuations.
