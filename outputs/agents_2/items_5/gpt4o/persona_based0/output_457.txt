Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  56  76  43  47
1  89  79  94  82  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 5 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can consider the valuations provided and attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while minimizing envy.

Let's start by considering the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 total value: 22 + 56 + 76 + 43 + 47 = 244
- Agent 1 total value: 89 + 79 + 94 + 82 + 88 = 432

Given these valuations, it appears that Agent 1 places a higher value on most items compared to Agent 0. Our goal is to allocate items such that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

One possible approach is to use a greedy allocation strategy based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest individual valuations, so we should allocate items they value highly while still allowing Agent 0 to receive some value:

   - Item 2: Agent 1 values this at 94, which is the highest single-item valuation. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 0: Although Agent 0 values this at 22, Agent 1 values it at 89. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Allocate to Agent 1 as they value it at 88, which is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation of 47.

2. **Agent 0**: Allocate the remaining items to Agent 0, ensuring they receive some value:

   - Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0 as Agent 0 values it at 56, and it's better to balance the allocation.
   - Item 3: Allocate to Agent 0 as they value it at 43, and this helps balance the total allocation.

This allocation strategy attempts to give Agent 1 the items they value most while still allowing Agent 0 to receive items they value reasonably well. The allocation should minimize envy given the constraints and valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3, while Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 4. This division attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their respective valuations.
