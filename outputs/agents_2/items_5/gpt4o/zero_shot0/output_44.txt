Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  45  25  17   8
1  99  19  93  67  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations and find a way to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 70 + 45 + 25 + 17 + 8 = 165
- Agent 1: 99 + 19 + 93 + 67 + 49 = 327

The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that the perceived value for each agent is as equal as possible.

One possible allocation could be:

- Assign items 0, 1, and 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 1.

Let's verify the total value for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0: 70 (item 0) + 45 (item 1) + 8 (item 4) = 123
- Agent 1: 93 (item 2) + 67 (item 3) = 160

This allocation attempts to balance the total values perceived by each agent. Note that the total values aren't perfectly equal due to the constraints of integer allocations, but this provides a reasonable approach given the differences in valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
