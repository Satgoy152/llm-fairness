Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27   6   7   5  30
1  48  50  59  30  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations provided, let's try to allocate the items so that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

1. **Agent 0** has valuations:  
   - Item 0: 27
   - Item 1: 6
   - Item 2: 7
   - Item 3: 5
   - Item 4: 30

2. **Agent 1** has valuations:  
   - Item 0: 48
   - Item 1: 50
   - Item 2: 59
   - Item 3: 30
   - Item 4: 71

To balance the distribution based on valuations, we should allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent, considering their preferences.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 1 has much higher valuations, especially for items 4 and 2. Assign these to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 can be allocated items where their values are relatively higher.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 27 + 6 + 5 = 38, and Agent 1 a total valuation of 59 + 71 = 130. This distribution maximizes the total value received by each agent based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
