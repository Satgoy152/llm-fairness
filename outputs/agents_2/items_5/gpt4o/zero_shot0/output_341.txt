Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  36  14  58  50
1  73  22   2  96  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we can use an approach that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common method for such allocation problems is to use a "greedy" approach, where we allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 47
   - Agent 1 values it at 73
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 36
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (higher valuation)

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 14
   - Agent 1 values it at 2
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (higher valuation)

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 96
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 50
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation is fair in the sense that each item is given to the agent who values it more, ensuring an integer number of items for each agent.
