Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  9  80  74   9  68
1  5  75  30  69  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations provided. We aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items. Let's go through each item and decide the allocation based on the highest value preference:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 9, and Agent 1 values it at 5. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 80, and Agent 1 values it at 75. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 74, and Agent 1 values it at 30. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 9, and Agent 1 values it at 69. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 68, and Agent 1 values it at 35. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that both agents get a fair share based on their valuations. It maximizes the total value for each agent given the options.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3]
}
```
