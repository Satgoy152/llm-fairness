Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  75  52  49  93
1  34  14  99  42  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1), we need to consider their valuations for each item and try to maximize the total satisfaction or ensure a fair distribution based on their preferences.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [48, 75, 52, 49, 93]
- Agent 1's valuations: [34, 14, 99, 42, 90]

A common approach is to use a method like the "maximum envy-free" allocation or "maximize total valuation" approach. For simplicity, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while considering their highest preferences.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's highest valuations: Item 4 (93), Item 1 (75), Item 2 (52)
   - Agent 1's highest valuations: Item 2 (99), Item 4 (90)

2. **Allocate Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 can be allocated Item 4 (93) as it is their highest preference.
   - Agent 1 can be allocated Item 2 (99) as it is their highest preference.

3. **Continue Allocating Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: [0, 1, 3] 
   - Agent 0's next highest: Item 1 (75)
   - Agent 1's next highest: Item 4 (90) (already allocated to Agent 0)

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Allocate remaining items to balance the number of items:
     - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4]
     - Agent 1: Items [2, 3]

### Final Allocations:

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent two items, and respects their highest value preferences as closely as possible given the constraints.
