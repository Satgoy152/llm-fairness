Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  7   7  67  65  18
1  4  77  52  38  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple approach where we try to maximize the total value each agent receives. We have two agents and five items, so each agent should ideally receive either two or three items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. List the total valuations each agent has for each item:
   - Agent 0: 7, 7, 67, 65, 18
   - Agent 1: 4, 77, 52, 38, 20

2. Find the item where the difference in valuations between the two agents is the largest and allocate that item to the agent with the higher valuation:
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 77, and Agent 0 values it at 7. Difference = 70.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. Continue this process for the remaining items:
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 65, and Agent 1 values it at 38. Difference = 27.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

4. Repeat the process:
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 67, and Agent 1 values it at 52. Difference = 15.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

5. Allocate remaining items by maximizing the total value:
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 18, and Agent 1 values it at 20.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

6. Item 0 is left:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
