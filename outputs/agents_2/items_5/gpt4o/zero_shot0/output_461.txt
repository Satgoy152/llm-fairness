Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  67  85  32  63  41
1  33  48  31  33  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we'll use a greedy approach. We'll allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, we'll need to balance the allocations.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0: [67, 85, 32, 63, 41]
- Agent 1: [33, 48, 31, 33, 58]

We'll allocate the items as follows:

1. Item 0: 
   - Valuation for Agent 0: 67
   - Valuation for Agent 1: 33
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

2. Item 1:
   - Valuation for Agent 0: 85
   - Valuation for Agent 1: 48
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

3. Item 2:
   - Valuation for Agent 0: 32
   - Valuation for Agent 1: 31
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

4. Item 3:
   - Valuation for Agent 0: 63
   - Valuation for Agent 1: 33
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

5. Item 4:
   - Valuation for Agent 0: 41
   - Valuation for Agent 1: 58
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

Now, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Since Agent 0 has 4 items and Agent 1 has 1, we should transfer one item from Agent 0 to Agent 1 to balance the allocations.

Let's consider transferring the item with the smallest difference in valuation that minimizes the loss in total value for Agent 0:

- Difference for Item 0: 67 - 33 = 34
- Difference for Item 1: 85 - 48 = 37
- Difference for Item 2: 32 - 31 = 1
- Difference for Item 3: 63 - 33 = 30

Item 2 has the smallest difference in valuation. Therefore, transferring Item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 will balance the allocation with minimal loss in total valuation for Agent 0.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
