Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  16  75  31  60
1  92  99  76  26  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives, often referred to as a "maximization of valuations" approach. We will assign items to the agent who values them the most.

Let's start by comparing the valuations of each item between the two agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 45, and Agent 1 values it at 92. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 16, and Agent 1 values it at 99. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 75, and Agent 1 values it at 76. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 31, and Agent 1 values it at 26. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 60, and Agent 1 values it at 27. Assign to Agent 0.

The allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 2.

In JSON format, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
