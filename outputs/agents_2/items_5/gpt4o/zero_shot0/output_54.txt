Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  41  58  23  90
1  99  70  18  20  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we can use a method called the "Envy-Free Allocation" or the "Maximum Nash Welfare" approach, which aims to maximize the product of the agents' utilities. For simplicity, we can also consider a "greedy" approach, which involves assigning items based on the highest valuation from each agent until all items are allocated.

Here's a straightforward way to allocate the items from the given valuations:

### Step 1: List the items and valuations
- Agent 0: [32, 41, 58, 23, 90]
- Agent 1: [99, 70, 18, 20, 11]

### Step 2: Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation
- Start with item 0:
  - Agent 1 values item 0 higher (99 vs. 32), so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Item 1:
  - Agent 1 values item 1 higher (70 vs. 41), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values item 2 higher (58 vs. 18), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values item 3 higher (23 vs. 20), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values item 4 higher (90 vs. 11), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.

### Step 3: Present the allocations in JSON format
Based on the allocations above, Agent 0 gets items 2, 3, and 4, and Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuation preference for each item, resulting in a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
