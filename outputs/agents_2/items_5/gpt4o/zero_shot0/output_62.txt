Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  18  13  49  52
1   3  27  53  59  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 3 27 53 59 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. This can be achieved by considering each agent's individual valuations for the items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [43, 18, 13, 49, 52]
- Agent 1: [3, 27, 53, 59, 55]

Let's analyze and allocate the items to maximize the fairness:

1. **Agent 1 highly values items 2, 3, and 4:**
   - Item 2: 53
   - Item 3: 59
   - Item 4: 55

2. **Agent 0 highly values items 0, 3, and 4:**
   - Item 0: 43
   - Item 3: 49
   - Item 4: 52

To achieve a fair allocation:

- Allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1 because they have higher valuations for these items than Agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
- Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values item 0 highly and Agent 1 does not value item 0 as much.

Thus, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3, 4]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
