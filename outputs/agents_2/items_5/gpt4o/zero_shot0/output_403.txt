Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86  71  69  27  30
1  15  48  14  32  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 48 14 32 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. We'll try to assign the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [86, 71, 69, 27, 30]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [15, 48, 14, 32, 45]

We want to assign items to maximize the perceived total value for each agent.

Let's go through a possible allocation:

1. Start with the highest valued items for each agent:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 86).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 71).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 45).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 32).

2. Now, we have:
   - Agent 0: [0, 1]
   - Agent 1: [3, 4]

3. We have item 2 remaining:
   - Item 2 has a value of 69 for Agent 0 and 14 for Agent 1.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 values it significantly more.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
