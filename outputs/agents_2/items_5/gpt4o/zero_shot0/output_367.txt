Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  26  82  77  36
1   2  88  66   0  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the allocation is fair based on their valuations. A good approach is to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items.

Let's calculate the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 21, 26, 82, 77, 36
   - Agent 1: 2, 88, 66, 0, 13

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - For each item, we determine which agent values it more and allocate it to that agent.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 values it at 2. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 88. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 values it at 66. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 13. Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2, 3, 4
   - Agent 1 gets items: 1

Given this analysis, here is the fair allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1]
}
```
