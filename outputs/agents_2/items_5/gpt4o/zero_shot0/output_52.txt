Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80   3  46  13  57
1  80  52  44  68  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  80   3  46  13  57
1  80  52  44  68  69
```

Here's a step-by-step approach to determine the allocations:

1. **Item 0**: Both agents value item 0 equally at 80. We can assign this item to either agent. Let's assign it to agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 3, whereas agent 1 values it at 52. Assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 46, whereas agent 1 values it at 44. Assign item 2 to agent 0 as it has a slightly higher value for them.

4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 13, whereas agent 1 values it at 68. Assign item 3 to agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 57, whereas agent 1 values it at 69. Assign item 4 to agent 1.

Now, let's verify the allocation:
- Agent 0 has items 0, 2 with total value = 80 + 46 = 126.
- Agent 1 has items 1, 3, 4 with total value = 52 + 68 + 69 = 189.

The allocations are balanced given the agents' valuations and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
