Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  46  20  33  54
1   9  96  65  37  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple method called the "greedy allocation method." This method aims to maximize the total value for each agent by assigning items one by one based on the highest value difference between agents.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. Calculate the difference in value each agent has for each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.
3. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the Difference in Valuations

For each item, calculate the difference in value between the two agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 values it at 9. Difference = 60.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 values it at 96. Difference = -50.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 values it at 65. Difference = -45.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 values it at 37. Difference = -4.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 values it at 39. Difference = 15.

### Step 2: Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation

Assign each item to the agent with the higher valuation:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 0 (higher value: 69 vs. 9).
- Item 1: Assign to Agent 1 (higher value: 96 vs. 46).
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 1 (higher value: 65 vs. 20).
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 1 (higher value: 37 vs. 33).
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 0 (higher value: 54 vs. 39).

### Step 3: Ensure Each Agent Gets an Integer Number of Items

Each agent has been assigned an integer number of items:

- Agent 0 has been assigned items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 has been assigned items 1, 2, and 3.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that considers their valuations and maximizes the total value received by each agent.
