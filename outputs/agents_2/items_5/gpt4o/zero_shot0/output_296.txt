Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  76  87  13  43
1  77  81  88  11  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the valuations** for each item by both agents:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 -> 74, Agent 1 -> 77
   - Item 1: Agent 0 -> 76, Agent 1 -> 81
   - Item 2: Agent 0 -> 87, Agent 1 -> 88
   - Item 3: Agent 0 -> 13, Agent 1 -> 11
   - Item 4: Agent 0 -> 43, Agent 1 -> 30

2. **Compare valuations** for each item and assign it to the agent who values it more:
   - Item 0: Assign to Agent 1 (77 > 74)
   - Item 1: Assign to Agent 1 (81 > 76)
   - Item 2: Assign to Agent 1 (88 > 87)
   - Item 3: Assign to Agent 0 (13 > 11)
   - Item 4: Assign to Agent 0 (43 > 30)

3. **Allocate items** such that both agents receive a roughly equal number of items. Since there are 5 items, one agent will receive 3 and the other 2. In this allocation, Agent 1 has a higher valuation for three items, which naturally gives them more items.

4. **Final allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items: 3, 4
   - Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
