Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  30  57  41  43
1  33  89   8   0  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total satisfaction for both agents. One common approach to fairness is to use the "envy-free" criterion, where no agent would prefer to have another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [97, 30, 57, 41, 43]
- Agent 1: [33, 89, 8, 0, 20]

We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. Since there are 5 items and 2 agents, one agent will get 3 items and the other will get 2.

Let's go through the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 97, while Agent 1 values it at 33. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 30, while Agent 1 values it at 89. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 8. Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 41, while Agent 1 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 43, while Agent 1 values it at 20. Assign to Agent 1.

Allocating in this way, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
