Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  90  76  75  17
1  68   0  83  43   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: 32, 90, 76, 75, 17
   - Agent 1: 68, 0, 83, 43, 6

2. **Allocate Items**:
   - Start by assigning items based on higher individual valuations for each agent, ensuring both agents get a similar total value.

3. **Allocation**:
   - Item 1 (value 90 for Agent 0, 0 for Agent 1) is best for Agent 0.
   - Item 2 (value 76 for Agent 0, 83 for Agent 1) is best for Agent 1.
   - Item 3 (value 75 for Agent 0, 43 for Agent 1) is best for Agent 0.
   - Item 0 (value 32 for Agent 0, 68 for Agent 1) is best for Agent 1.
   - Item 4 (value 17 for Agent 0, 6 for Agent 1) can go to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 2

This allocation maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
