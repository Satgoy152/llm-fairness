Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  12  66  80  61
1  71  85  87  27  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One way to achieve this is by considering each agent's valuations and allocating items to maximize the sum of values for each agent.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. Compare the valuation of each item for both agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.

Let's apply this approach to the given data:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 71. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 values it at 85. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 values it at 87. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 values it at 27. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 72. Allocate to Agent 1.

Based on these allocations, the JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, maximizing the total value for each agent.
