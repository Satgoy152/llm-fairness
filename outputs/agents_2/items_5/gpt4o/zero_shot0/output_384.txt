Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  20  58  55  86
1  10  31  39  22  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the sum of allocations in a way that both agents feel satisfied with their share. One common approach is to use the idea of maximizing the minimum utility (also known as max-min fairness), ensuring that each agent gets the highest possible minimal satisfaction.

Let's evaluate this allocation problem:

Agent 0's valuations: [2, 20, 58, 55, 86]  
Agent 1's valuations: [10, 31, 39, 22, 54]

1. **Assign Items with Highest Valuation to Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (86).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (39).

2. **Proceed with Remaining Items**:
   - For the remaining items [0, 1, 3]:
     - Agent 0 values: [2, 20, 55]
     - Agent 1 values: [10, 31, 22]

3. **Allocate Remaining Items Based on Value**:
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (55 > 22).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (31 > 20).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (10 > 2).

Thus, the fair allocation can be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes each agent's utility based on their valuations and ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items.
