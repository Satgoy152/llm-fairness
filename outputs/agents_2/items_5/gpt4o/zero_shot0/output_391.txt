Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  69  91  76  71
1  14  84  84  61  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to look at the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction or utility, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. One simple method to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "max-min fair" approach, where we try to maximize the minimum satisfaction level among all agents.

Given the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  69  91  76  71
1  14  84  84  61  20
```

Let's assign items such that both agents get an approximately equal total valuation:

1. Agent 0 values items 2 and 3 highly, so we might prioritize these for them.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest, so it should go to them.

Let's assign the items:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 91)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 76)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 64)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 84)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 20)

Now let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 91 (Item 2) + 76 (Item 3) + 64 (Item 0) = 231
- Agent 1: 84 (Item 1) + 20 (Item 4) = 104

The allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation maximizes Agent 1's utility for the items they value most while also ensuring Agent 0 gets a higher total valuation from their perspective.
