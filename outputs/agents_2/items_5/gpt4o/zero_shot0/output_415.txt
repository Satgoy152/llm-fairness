Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  69  61  99  16
1  85  57  92   3  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 3, 69, 61, 99, 16
- Agent 1: 85, 57, 92, 3, 28

We can calculate the total valuation each agent has over all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: \(3 + 69 + 61 + 99 + 16 = 248\)
- Total value for Agent 1: \(85 + 57 + 92 + 3 + 28 = 265\)

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the total perceived value for each agent:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 3.
   - Agent 1 values it at 85.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 69.
   - Agent 1 values it at 57.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 61.
   - Agent 1 values it at 92.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 99.
   - Agent 1 values it at 3.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 16.
   - Agent 1 values it at 28.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

The allocation is as follows:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 4.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
