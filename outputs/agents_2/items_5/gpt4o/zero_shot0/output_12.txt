Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  25  15  45  32
1  61  65  63  14  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We have 2 agents and 5 items, and each agent must receive an integer number of items. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to fairly allocate the items:

1. **Calculate total valuations for all possible allocations:**
   - Agent 0 values: [61, 25, 15, 45, 32]
   - Agent 1 values: [61, 65, 63, 14, 66]

2. **Determine the optimal allocation:**
   - We'll aim to split the items such that both agents receive a similar total valuation.

3. **Possible allocations:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 3, 4] | Agent 1: [1, 2] 
     - Total for Agent 0: 61 + 45 + 32 = 138
     - Total for Agent 1: 65 + 63 = 128
   - Agent 0: [0, 1] | Agent 1: [2, 3, 4]
     - Total for Agent 0: 61 + 25 = 86
     - Total for Agent 1: 63 + 14 + 66 = 143
   - Agent 0: [0, 2, 3] | Agent 1: [1, 4]
     - Total for Agent 0: 61 + 15 + 45 = 121
     - Total for Agent 1: 65 + 66 = 131
   - Agent 0: [0, 4] | Agent 1: [1, 2, 3]
     - Total for Agent 0: 61 + 32 = 93
     - Total for Agent 1: 65 + 63 + 14 = 142
   - Agent 0: [1, 3, 4] | Agent 1: [0, 2]
     - Total for Agent 0: 25 + 45 + 32 = 102
     - Total for Agent 1: 61 + 15 = 76

From these calculations, the allocation [0, 3, 4] to agent 0 and [1, 2] to agent 1 provides relatively balanced total valuations, with agent 0 receiving 138 and agent 1 receiving 128.

4. **Final allocation in JSON format:**
   ```json
   {
       "0": [0, 3, 4],
       "1": [1, 2]
   }
   ```

This allocation ensures that both agents get a fair share of the total valuation while adhering to the constraint of integer allocations.
