Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62   9  87   6  67
1   5  62  63  15  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[62  9 87  6 67]
 [ 5 62 63 15 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuation of each item by each agent and aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's look at the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [62, 9, 87, 6, 67]
Agent 1: [5, 62, 63, 15, 55]
```

We should try to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is as high as possible while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (87), Item 4 (67), Item 0 (62)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (62), Item 2 (63), Item 4 (55)

To ensure fairness and maximize total valuations for both agents, a possible allocation can be:

- **Agent 0:** Gets items that they value the most and are not highly valued by Agent 1.
- **Agent 1:** Gets items that they value the most and are not highly valued by Agent 0.

After analyzing the valuations, an allocation could be:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 2
- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 3, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items, maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
