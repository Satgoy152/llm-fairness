Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1  2   3   4
0  77  36  2  95  66
1   6  70  1  57  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total utility for each agent based on their valuations. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s how the allocation would look based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 77, and Agent 1 values it at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 36, and Agent 1 values it at 70. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 2, and Agent 1 values it at 1. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 95, and Agent 1 values it at 57. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 66, and Agent 1 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.

Based on these allocations, Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 3, and 4 because they have higher valuations for these items. Agent 1 receives item 1 because they value it more than Agent 0 does.

So the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1]
}
```
