Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44   5  56  68  28
1  87  12  86  95   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use different strategies like maximizing total valuation, ensuring a balanced distribution, or using a simple heuristic approach. Here, I'll use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each gets an integer number of items.

First, let's analyze the valuation table:

- Agent 0 values: [44, 5, 56, 68, 28]
- Agent 1 values: [87, 12, 86, 95, 7]

To maximize the total valuations, we should allocate the items to the agent who values them the most. Let's allocate the items based on each agent's preference to maximize their total value:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (87 vs. 44).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it more (5 vs. 12), but both values are low; the decision here doesn't significantly impact fairness, so I can assign it to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (86 vs. 56).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it more (95 vs. 68).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it more (28 vs. 7).

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 5 items, one agent will get 3 items and the other will get 2. Here's a fair allocation based on their valuations:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Give Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Give Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Give Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Give Item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives Agent 1 a higher total value, but it maximizes the use of their higher valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4, while Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 3. This division attempts to fairly distribute based on each agent's valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
