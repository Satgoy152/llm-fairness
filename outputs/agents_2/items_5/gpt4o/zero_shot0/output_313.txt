Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  32  92  67   7
1   5  26  33  99  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 26 33 99 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One way to achieve this is by assigning items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the total value.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 92
  - Item 3: 67
  - Item 4: 7

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 5
  - Item 1: 26
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 99
  - Item 4: 70

To allocate the items fairly, we'll start by assigning items with the highest value for each agent:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest value is for Item 0 (99), followed by Item 2 (92).

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest value is for Item 3 (99), followed by Item 4 (70).

Now, allocate the remaining items based on the next highest values:

- Agent 0 can take Item 3 because they value it at 67, which is more than Agent 1's valuation of 99 for the same item, but Agent 1 already has Item 3.
- Agent 1 can take Item 1 because they value it at 26, which is more than Agent 0's valuation of 32 for the same item.

After these considerations, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 1

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and tries to maximize their total value based on their valuations.
