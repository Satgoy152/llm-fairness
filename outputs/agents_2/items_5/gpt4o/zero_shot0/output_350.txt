Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  88  64  12  28
1  92  87  31  50  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One way to approach this is to use a method like the "greedy" allocation based on the highest value each agent places on the items.

Let's evaluate this step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations**:  
   - Item 0: 45  
   - Item 1: 88  
   - Item 2: 64  
   - Item 3: 12  
   - Item 4: 28  

2. **Agent 1 Valuations**:  
   - Item 0: 92  
   - Item 1: 87  
   - Item 2: 31  
   - Item 3: 50  
   - Item 4: 45  

Each agent should get approximately half the total items since there are 5 items and 2 agents.

Analyzing the valuations:
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (92 vs 45).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (88 vs 87).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (64 vs 31).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (50 vs 12).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (45 vs 28).

Based on these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:
- Agent 0 gets Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets Items 0, 3, and 4.

This allocation aims to balance the number of items while considering the agents' preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
