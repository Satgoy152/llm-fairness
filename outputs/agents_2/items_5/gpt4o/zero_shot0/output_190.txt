Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  35  38  98  21
1  59  53  55  96   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total utility for each agent. This is often known as the "maximize minimum utility" approach or "envy-free" allocation, where we try to ensure that no agent feels envious of anotherâ€™s allocation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [54, 35, 38, 98, 21]
Agent 1: [59, 53, 55, 96,  4]
```

To find a fair allocation, we can start by evaluating which agent values each item more and allocate accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 54, and Agent 1 values it at 59. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 35, and Agent 1 values it at 53. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 38, and Agent 1 values it at 55. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 98, and Agent 1 values it at 96. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 21, and Agent 1 values it at 4. Allocate to Agent 0.

The allocations are:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 2.

This allocation is based on maximizing each agent's utility according to the given valuations.

Thus, the JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
