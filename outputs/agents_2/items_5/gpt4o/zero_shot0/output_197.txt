Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  15  96   3  82
1  86  62  34  78  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. Given the valuations, one approach is to allocate items such that the total value is balanced between the two agents as much as possible. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (96), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (86), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. For item 1, Agent 1 values it more (62 vs. 15), so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
4. For item 3, Agent 1 values it more (78 vs. 3), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
5. Finally, for item 4, Agent 0 values it more (82 vs. 22), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
