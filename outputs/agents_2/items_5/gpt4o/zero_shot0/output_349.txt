Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  30   6  98  75
1  79  78  20  22  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can look for allocations that maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One way to do this is to allocate items in such a way that both agents receive a similar total valuation.

Let's compute the total valuation each agent would receive if we allocate the items based on their preferences:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 20
   - Item 1: 30
   - Item 2: 6
   - Item 3: 98
   - Item 4: 75

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 79
   - Item 1: 78
   - Item 2: 20
   - Item 3: 22
   - Item 4: 13

We will try to allocate items in such a way that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

- **Agent 0 has high value for items 3 and 4.**
- **Agent 1 has high value for items 0 and 1.**

A possible allocation could be:
- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1, 2

Let's check the total value for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: 98 (item 3) + 75 (item 4) = 173
- **Agent 1**: 79 (item 0) + 78 (item 1) + 20 (item 2) = 177

This allocation results in a close total valuation for both agents, which is fairly balanced.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
