Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  86  70  75  86
1  80   4  77  85  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use an algorithm that maximizes the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the value each agent has for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 values it at 80.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 values it at 4.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 77.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 85.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 values it at 81.

Now, allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0 goes to Agent 1 (value: 80).
2. Item 1 goes to Agent 0 (value: 86).
3. Item 2 goes to Agent 1 (value: 77).
4. Item 3 goes to Agent 1 (value: 85).
5. Item 4 goes to Agent 0 (value: 86).

Now, we provide the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, ensuring that all items are allocated to the agent who values them the most.
