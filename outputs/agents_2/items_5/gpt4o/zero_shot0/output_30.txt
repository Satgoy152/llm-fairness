Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  48  10  38   7
1  87  85  56  54  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the total valuation each agent has for all the items and try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent and then try to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0's valuations:**
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 38
  - Item 4: 7
  - **Total: 26 + 48 + 10 + 38 + 7 = 129**

- **Agent 1's valuations:**
  - Item 0: 87
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 56
  - Item 3: 54
  - Item 4: 73
  - **Total: 87 + 85 + 56 + 54 + 73 = 355**

Next, we will allocate the items to balance the total valuation as much as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Allocate high-value items to Agent 1, since Agent 1 has higher overall valuations.**
2. **Allocate remaining items to Agent 0.**

Let's allocate:

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 87
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 56
  
  **Total for Agent 1: 87 + 85 + 56 = 228**

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 3: 38
  - Item 4: 7
  
  **Total for Agent 0: 38 + 7 = 45**

Upon reviewing, it seems like the allocation is not yet balanced, so let's re-evaluate and adjust:

- **Agent 0 gets Item 1 (48) and Item 3 (38)**
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 48 + 38 = 86

- **Agent 1 gets Item 0 (87), Item 2 (56), and Item 4 (73)**
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 87 + 56 + 73 = 216

While this allocation still seems imbalanced, it's a better alignment based on the integer constraint.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items based on the given valuations while maintaining each agent gets an integer number of items.
