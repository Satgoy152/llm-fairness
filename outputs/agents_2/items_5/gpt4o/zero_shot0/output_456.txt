Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2  3   4
0  73  88  28  9  30
1   0  69  15  1  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Let's analyze the values and attempt a fair allocation:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 73
- Item 1: 88
- Item 2: 28
- Item 3: 9
- Item 4: 30

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 0
- Item 1: 69
- Item 2: 15
- Item 3: 1
- Item 4: 27

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0 (88) and is also valued by Agent 1 but less so (69), so allocate it to Agent 0.
2. Item 0 is also highly valued by Agent 0 (73) and not valued at all by Agent 1 (0), so allocate it to Agent 0.
3. Item 4 has a decent value for both agents (Agent 0: 30, Agent 1: 27). To balance the allocation, let's give it to Agent 1.
4. Item 2 is more valued by Agent 0 (28) than Agent 1 (15), but let's consider the overall balance after previous allocations. To ensure Agent 1 also gets reasonable value, allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
5. Item 3 is the least valued item overall. Although it has low values, it can be allocated to Agent 1 to ensure each agent gets an equal number of items.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
