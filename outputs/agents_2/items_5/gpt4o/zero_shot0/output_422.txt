Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  96  88  66  34
1  55   9  75  15  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. This could involve a greedy approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's proceed with this method:

1. Assign item 0:  
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 38.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 55.  
   Assign item 0 to agent 1.

2. Assign item 1:  
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 96.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 9.  
   Assign item 1 to agent 0.

3. Assign item 2:  
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 88.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 75.  
   Assign item 2 to agent 0.

4. Assign item 3:  
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 66.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 15.  
   Assign item 3 to agent 0.

5. Assign item 4:  
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 34.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 29.  
   Assign item 4 to agent 0.

Now, let's format the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value that each agent can gain based on their preferences.
