Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  95  46  86  83
1  57  20  30  40  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations of each item by the agents. One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize the total value for each agent, potentially using a variant of the "maximum bipartite matching" problem or a "round-robin" allocation based on item valuations.

Let's analyze and allocate the items according to their valuations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**  
   - Item 0: 94  
   - Item 1: 95  
   - Item 2: 46  
   - Item 3: 86  
   - Item 4: 83  

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**  
   - Item 0: 57  
   - Item 1: 20  
   - Item 2: 30  
   - Item 3: 40  
   - Item 4: 39  

To maximize fairness and efficiency, let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has a significantly higher valuation for items 0, 1, 3, and 4 compared to Agent 1.
- Agent 1 has relatively lower valuations compared to Agent 0, but let's try to balance the allocations by ensuring Agent 1 gets some items.

Given these valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- Assign high-value items for Agent 0 and balance it with Agent 1's allocations.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 since it's the least valued by Agent 0 and more balanced between the two.

The allocation is as follows:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 1, 3, and 4.
- **Agent 1:** Item 2.

Now let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and the distribution is as fair as possible given the valuations.
