Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  94  14  28  49
1  96  11  73  49   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. This is typically approached by maximizing the overall efficiency or fairness of the allocation. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:**
   - Agent 0's total value = 56 + 94 + 14 + 28 + 49 = 241
   - Agent 1's total value = 96 + 11 + 73 + 49 + 4 = 233

2. **Allocate items to maximize individual valuations:**
   - Agent 0 has higher valuations on items 1 and 0.
   - Agent 1 has higher valuations on items 2, 3, and 4.

3. **Allocate items based on maximizing individual agent valuations:**
   - Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 (since these are the items with the highest values for Agent 0).
   - Assign items 2, 3, and 4 to Agent 1 (since these have higher values compared to Agent 0).

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
