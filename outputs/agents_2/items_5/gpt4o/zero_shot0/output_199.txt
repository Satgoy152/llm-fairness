Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  32   7  79   0
1  44  42  35  27  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a strategy like the "max-min" method or a simple greedy allocation based on the value each agent assigns to each item. Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Let's first list the items with their respective values for each agent:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 values it at 42
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 values it at 35
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 27
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 values it at 30

2. A simple approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

   - Item 0 should go to Agent 1 (since 44 > 2)
   - Item 1 should go to Agent 1 (since 42 > 32)
   - Item 2 should go to Agent 1 (since 35 > 7)
   - Item 3 should go to Agent 0 (since 79 > 27)
   - Item 4 should go to Agent 1 (since 30 > 0)

3. Based on this allocation, we have:

Agent 0 receives item 3.
Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 4.

Now, in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and aims to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.
