Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  68  19  51   7
1  30  62  36  14  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll use a simple approach to allocate items based on the maximum valuation by each agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [63, 68, 19, 51, 7]
- Agent 1's valuations: [30, 62, 36, 14, 36]

We can allocate items to each agent based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives a fair number of items.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it more (63 vs. 30), so allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it more (68 vs. 62), so allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values it more (36 vs. 19), so allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it more (51 vs. 14), so allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 values it more (36 vs. 7), so allocate to Agent 1.

Thus, we allocate three items to Agent 0 and two items to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their valuations, with Agent 0 receiving items 0, 1, and 3, while Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4.
