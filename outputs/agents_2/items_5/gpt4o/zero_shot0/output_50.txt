Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  34  88  40   4
1  81  38  75  28  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. One common approach is to use techniques like maximizing the minimum utility or the envy-free allocation, but given the small size of the problem, we can manually check for a fair distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items in a fair manner:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 13
- Item 1: 34
- Item 2: 88
- Item 3: 40
- Item 4: 4

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 81
- Item 1: 38
- Item 2: 75
- Item 3: 28
- Item 4: 24

To ensure fairness, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Start with the highest-valued items for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (88).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (81).

2. Allocate these items first:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. Remaining items:
   - Items 1, 3, 4

4. Next, consider the second-highest values:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 as next highest (40).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 as next highest (38).

5. Allocate these:
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

6. Remaining item:
   - Item 4

7. Compare the remaining valuations for item 4 for fairness:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 4.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 24.

8. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 to maximize fairness.

Now, let's tally up the total valuations each agent receives with this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 3]:
  - Total value = 88 (item 2) + 40 (item 3) = 128

- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1, 4]:
  - Total value = 81 (item 0) + 38 (item 1) + 24 (item 4) = 143

This distribution is relatively balanced given the constraints. Both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
