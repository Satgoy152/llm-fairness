Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2  3   4
0  67  29  81  9  32
1   8  47  48  1  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to assign the items to the agent who values them the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 67.
   - Agent 1 values it at 8.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 29.
   - Agent 1 values it at 47.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 81.
   - Agent 1 values it at 48.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 9.
   - Agent 1 values it at 1.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 32.
   - Agent 1 values it at 42.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
