Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  14  52  56  77
1  95  13  66  74  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One approach to achieve this is to use the "greedy" method, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are assigned.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Compare the value each agent assigns to each item:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 13, and Agent 1 values it at 95.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 14, and Agent 1 values it at 13.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 52, and Agent 1 values it at 66.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 56, and Agent 1 values it at 74.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 77, and Agent 1 values it at 25.

2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

   - Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1 (value: 95)
   - Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0 (value: 14)
   - Item 2: Allocate to Agent 1 (value: 66)
   - Item 3: Allocate to Agent 1 (value: 74)
   - Item 4: Allocate to Agent 0 (value: 77)

3. Present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the maximum possible value based on their individual valuations of the items.
