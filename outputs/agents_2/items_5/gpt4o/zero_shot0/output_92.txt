Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  80  45  35  98
1  67  84  63  10  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to consider distributing the items such that each agent receives a fair share or maximizes their total valuation. Here are the steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Aim to balance the total value received by each agent.
3. Assign items to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 81     | 80     | 45     | 35     | 98     |
| 1     | 67     | 84     | 63     | 10     | 59     |

The total valuations for all items are:

- Agent 0: 81 + 80 + 45 + 35 + 98 = 339
- Agent 1: 67 + 84 + 63 + 10 + 59 = 283

A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation difference for each agent:

1. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it significantly higher than Agent 1 (98 vs 59).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it higher (84 vs 80).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it has a very high value 81 (compared to 67 for Agent 1).
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it has a high valuation difference (63 vs 45).
5. Finally, assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 (35 vs 10).

Allocations are then:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items and the total valuation is distributed as evenly as possible.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
