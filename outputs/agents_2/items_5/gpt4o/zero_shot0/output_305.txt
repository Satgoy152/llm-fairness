Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  34  7   6  73  29
1  15  5  70  21  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Let's calculate the total value for each possible allocation and choose the one that minimizes the difference in total value between the agents.

Here are the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [34, 7, 6, 73, 29]
- Agent 1: [15, 5, 70, 21, 37]

Now, let's consider a fair allocation:

1. Allocate items to maximize each agent's benefit while trying to balance the total value.

Let's try the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4]
  - Total value: 34 + 73 + 29 = 136
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2]
  - Total value: 5 + 70 = 75

This allocation is not balanced, so let's try another one:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3]
  - Total value: 34 + 7 + 73 = 114
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
  - Total value: 70 + 37 = 107

This allocation is closer in terms of total value. Let's finalize it:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide a fair distribution of the total value between the two agents.
