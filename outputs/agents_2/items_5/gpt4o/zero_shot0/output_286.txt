Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  33  11  68  48
1  52  80  72  22  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from the items they receive. Let's examine the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: [53, 33, 11, 68, 48]
Agent 1: [52, 80, 72, 22, 21]
```

A common approach is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items to maximize fairness and value:

1. Compare the values for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 53, and Agent 1 values it at 52. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 33, and Agent 1 values it at 80. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 11, and Agent 1 values it at 72. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 68, and Agent 1 values it at 22. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 48, and Agent 1 values it at 21. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it more.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
