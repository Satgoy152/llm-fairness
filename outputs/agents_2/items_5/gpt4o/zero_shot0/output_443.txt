Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  60   3  67  54
1  62  74  86  30  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items, and compare for each item which agent values it more. Allocate the item to the agent who values it higher.

2. If there is a tie or near tie in valuations for an item, consider the overall distribution and aim for balance.

Applying these steps to the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 62, while Agent 0 values it at 3. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 74, while Agent 0 values it at 60. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 86, while Agent 0 values it at 3. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 67, while Agent 1 values it at 30. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 95, while Agent 0 values it at 54. Allocate to Agent 1.

Based on these allocations, here is the distribution in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it more, resulting in a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
