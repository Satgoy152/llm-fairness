Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  17  90  76  98
1  33  94   2  42   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction for each agent. We will allocate the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and ideally, each agent should receive items that they value highly.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 90
  - Item 3: 76
  - Item 4: 98

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 2: 2
  - Item 3: 42
  - Item 4: 4

Let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's total valuation:

1. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this at 98, while Agent 1 values it at 4. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this at 90, while Agent 1 values it at 2. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this at 88, while Agent 1 values it at 33. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this at 94, while Agent 0 values it at 17. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this at 76, while Agent 1 values it at 42. Allocate to Agent 0.

By following this allocation, each agent receives a number of items, and the allocation takes into account the agents' preferences based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that Agent 0, who generally values most items more highly, receives the items they value the most, while Agent 1 receives the item they value the highest among the remaining items.
