Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  57  27  57  25
1  10   7  81  33   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, let's first examine their valuations for each item:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 57
  - Item 2: 27
  - Item 3: 57
  - Item 4: 25

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 3: 33
  - Item 4: 7

To maximize fairness, we should aim to allocate items such that the total value of items for each agent is as balanced as possible. A common approach is to start by giving each item to the agent who values it the most, provided it leads to an integer number of items per agent.

Let's analyze and perform an allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it higher (33 vs. 10).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it higher (57 vs. 7).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it higher (81 vs. 27).
4. **Item 3**: Both agents value equally (57 vs. 33), but Agent 0 values it higher.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it higher, but the value difference is not significant (25 vs. 7).

A balanced allocation maximizing each agent's total valuation could be:

- **Agent 0** gets items 0, 1, and 3.
- **Agent 1** gets items 2 and 4.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (33) + Item 1 (57) + Item 3 (57) = Total value: 147
- Agent 1: Item 2 (81) + Item 4 (7) = Total value: 88

Although Agent 0's total value is higher, both agents receive an integer number of items, and the specific allocation respects each agent's higher valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
