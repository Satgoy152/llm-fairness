Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  18  66  31  27
1  73  21  82  95  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their respective valuations for each item.

Let's look at the values:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 31
  - Item 4: 27

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 82
  - Item 3: 95
  - Item 4: 74

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to ensure each agent receives a fair share of value. One method is to allocate items based on the relative higher valuation by each agent.

1. **Item 3** has the highest valuation difference in favor of Agent 1 (95 vs. 31).
2. **Item 2** is rated higher by Agent 1 as well (82 vs. 66).
3. **Item 0** is rated slightly higher by Agent 0 (78 vs. 73).
4. **Item 4** is rated higher by Agent 1 (74 vs. 27).
5. **Item 1** is rated a bit higher by Agent 1 (21 vs. 18).

Based on these considerations, a fair allocation could be:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (78 is higher for Agent 0 than 73 for Agent 1).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (21 is higher for Agent 1 than 18 for Agent 0).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (82 is higher for Agent 1 than 66 for Agent 0).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (95 is higher for Agent 1 than 31 for Agent 0).
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (Since Item 0 was given to Agent 0 and the rest were already favoring Agent 1, we balance by giving Item 4 to Agent 0).

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 and Agent 1 both receive a reasonable share of the total value based on their respective preferences.

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
