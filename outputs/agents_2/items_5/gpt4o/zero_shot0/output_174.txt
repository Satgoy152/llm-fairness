Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  88  76  59  72
1  47  45  42  84  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach it:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Valuations: [87, 88, 76, 59, 72]
   - Total valuation for all items: 87 + 88 + 76 + 59 + 72 = 382

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Valuations: [47, 45, 42, 84, 23]
   - Total valuation for all items: 47 + 45 + 42 + 84 + 23 = 241

We can start by assigning items based on the highest valuation difference between the two agents for each item, thereby maximizing fairness. Let's consider the differences:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 47. Difference = 87 - 47 = 40
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 values it at 45. Difference = 88 - 45 = 43
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 42. Difference = 76 - 42 = 34
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 values it at 84. Difference = 59 - 84 = -25
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 values it at 23. Difference = 72 - 23 = 49

Based on these differences, we can make the following allocations to ensure fairness:

- Assign Item 0, Item 1, Item 2, and Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest positive differences)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (only negative difference)

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items with the highest valuation differences in their favor and gives Agent 1 the item with the highest valuation in their favor.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3]
}
```
