Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  42  75  34  20
1  80  62  35  82   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their total valuation, while also ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value. Let's break down the problem and make the allocations:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Valuation Matrix:**

   \[
   \begin{array}{c|ccccc}
   \text{Agent/Item} & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
   \hline
   0 & 9 & 42 & 75 & 34 & 20 \\
   1 & 80 & 62 & 35 & 82 & 1 \\
   \end{array}
   \]

2. **Total Valuation for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: \(9 + 42 + 75 + 34 + 20 = 180\)
   - Agent 1: \(80 + 62 + 35 + 82 + 1 = 260\)

3. **Fair Allocation Goals:**

   Ideally, we want to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total value. The total value is \(180 + 260 = 440\), so each agent should get around half of this total value in their allocated items.

4. **Greedy Allocation Approach:**

   - **Agent 1** values item 3 highly (82), item 0 very highly (80), and item 1 (62). Allocating item 3 and item 0 to Agent 1 seems beneficial.
   - **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest (75), so assigning item 2 to Agent 0 is reasonable.

5. **Allocating Remaining Items:**

   - After allocating items 3 and 0 to Agent 1, and item 2 to Agent 0:
     - Remaining items are 1 and 4.

   - **Item 1:** 
     - Agent 0 values it at 42, and Agent 1 at 62.
     - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

   - **Item 4:**
     - Agent 0 values it at 20, and Agent 1 at 1.
     - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Final Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: [2, 4]
   - Agent 1: [3, 0, 1]

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 0, 1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the total value based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
