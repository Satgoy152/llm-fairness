Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  54  57  61  52
1  57  18  95  11  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can follow a method called "envy-free allocation." This aims to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations for each item:

- Agent 0: [96, 54, 57, 61, 52]
- Agent 1: [57, 18, 95, 11, 95]

We will attempt to balance the total valuation each agent receives by testing different allocations.

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent based on their individual preferences.

2. Calculate the total valuation for each allocation and adjust to ensure fairness.

Let's try the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, and 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 2 and 4

Valuations for this allocation:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 96 (item 0) + 54 (item 1) + 61 (item 3) = 211
- Agent 1's total valuation: 95 (item 2) + 95 (item 4) = 190

This allocation is not perfectly balanced, but it is reasonably fair given the constraints of the integer number of items per agent. Agent 0 receives slightly more in terms of valuation, but each agent has received items they value highly.

Here is the JSON formatted allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
