Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  59  25  89  26
1  37  88  75  91  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach for such a problem is using a "greedy" algorithm to allocate items based on the highest valuation differences between agents.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Calculate the Difference**: Compute the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. **Sort and Allocate Based on Differences**: For each item, determine which agent values it more and allocate it to that agent. If the differences are equal or the allocation becomes unfair, ensure a balanced distribution.

Let's perform these steps:

| Item | Agent 0 Valuation | Agent 1 Valuation | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
|  0   |        95         |        37         |               58               |
|  1   |        59         |        88         |              -29               |
|  2   |        25         |        75         |              -50               |
|  3   |        89         |        91         |               -2               |
|  4   |        26         |        66         |              -40               |

Now, sort items by the absolute value of differences in descending order:

1. Item 2: Difference = 50
2. Item 4: Difference = 40
3. Item 1: Difference = 29
4. Item 0: Difference = 58
5. Item 3: Difference = 2

Allocate items based on these differences:

- **Agent 0** benefits more from item 0, so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** benefits more from items 1, 2, 3, and 4, so allocate these items to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and it is balanced based on the valuation differences.
