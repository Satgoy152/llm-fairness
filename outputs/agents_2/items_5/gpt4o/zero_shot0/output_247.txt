Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  99  55   5  85
1  70  57   3  59  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach to achieving a fair allocation is to use an algorithm that balances the valuations, such as the maximum valuation or the envy-free allocation approach.

For this specific scenario, we can proceed with a simple greedy algorithm by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's evaluate the given valuations:

- For item 0:
  - Agent 0 values it at 29
  - Agent 1 values it at 70
  - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

- For item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 99
  - Agent 1 values it at 57
  - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation)

- For item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 55
  - Agent 1 values it at 3
  - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation)

- For item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 5
  - Agent 1 values it at 59
  - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation)

- For item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 85
  - Agent 1 values it at 46
  - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest valuation)

Based on the above assignments, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation is based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive.
