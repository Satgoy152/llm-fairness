Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  18  52  73  56
1  93  40  64  55  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Evaluate the marginal utility for each item for both agents, which is the value difference in case of allocation to one agent over the other.
3. Allocate items to the agent with the higher valuation for that item until each agent has a fair share of the total value.

Let's evaluate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 values it at 93. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 values it at 40. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 52, Agent 1 values it at 64. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 values it at 55. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 values it at 69. Allocate to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items that maximize their total value based on their preferences. Since Agent 1 has higher valuations for most items, they receive more items. However, this is balanced by ensuring Agent 0 receives high-value items according to their valuations.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects the valuation preferences and aims for a fair distribution based on maximizing total value per agent.
