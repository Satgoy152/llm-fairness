Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  79  94  49  68
1   5   8  89  99  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple method of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are assigned. Since there are two agents and five items, one agent will receive three items, and the other will receive two items.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation and choose the one that maximizes fairness, which might involve balancing the total valuation between the agents. 

Let's go through possible allocations:

1. Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 2] and Agent 1 gets items [3, 4]:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 43 + 79 + 94 = 216
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 99 + 82 = 181

2. Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 3] and Agent 1 gets items [2, 4]:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 43 + 79 + 49 = 171
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 89 + 82 = 171

3. Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 4] and Agent 1 gets items [2, 3]:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 43 + 79 + 68 = 190
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 89 + 99 = 188

4. Agent 0 gets items [0, 2, 3] and Agent 1 gets items [1, 4]:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 43 + 94 + 49 = 186
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 8 + 82 = 90

5. Agent 0 gets items [0, 2, 4] and Agent 1 gets items [1, 3]:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 43 + 94 + 68 = 205
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 8 + 99 = 107

6. Agent 0 gets items [0, 3, 4] and Agent 1 gets items [1, 2]:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 43 + 49 + 68 = 160
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 8 + 89 = 97

7. Agent 0 gets items [1, 2, 3] and Agent 1 gets items [0, 4]:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 79 + 94 + 49 = 222
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 5 + 82 = 87

8. Agent 0 gets items [1, 2, 4] and Agent 1 gets items [0, 3]:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 79 + 94 + 68 = 241
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 5 + 99 = 104

9. Agent 0 gets items [1, 3, 4] and Agent 1 gets items [0, 2]:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 79 + 49 + 68 = 196
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 5 + 89 = 94

10. Agent 0 gets items [2, 3, 4] and Agent 1 gets items [0, 1]:
    - Agent 0's total valuation: 94 + 49 + 68 = 211
    - Agent 1's total valuation: 5 + 8 = 13

Among these allocations, option 2 seems to be the most balanced in terms of total valuation, where both agents have equal total valuations. Therefore, the allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
