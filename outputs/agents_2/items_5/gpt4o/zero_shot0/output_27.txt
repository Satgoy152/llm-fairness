Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  81  96  89  88
1  71  59  33  44  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Let's consider the valuations provided:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 82
- Item 1: 81
- Item 2: 96
- Item 3: 89
- Item 4: 88

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 71
- Item 1: 59
- Item 2: 33
- Item 3: 44
- Item 4: 75

To fairly allocate the items, we can employ a strategy such as maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent or using a method like the "round-robin" approach or "envy-free" allocation if applicable. In this case, let's use a simple strategy to ensure a fair distribution by maximizing individual satisfaction.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0's Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 2: 96
   - Item 3: 89
   - Item 0: 82
   - Item 4: 88
   - Item 1: 81

2. **Agent 1's Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 4: 75
   - Item 0: 71
   - Item 1: 59
   - Item 3: 44
   - Item 2: 33

### Allocation Decision

- **Item 2**: Given to Agent 0 (highest valuation)
- **Item 3**: Given to Agent 0 (second highest valuation)
- **Item 4**: Given to Agent 1 (highest valuation)
- **Item 0**: Given to Agent 1 (second highest valuation)
- **Item 1**: Given to Agent 0 (next highest valuation for remaining items)

This allocation ensures each agent gets the highest possible value from the items they receive based on their individual valuations.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 1],
    "1": [4, 0]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 2, 3, and 1, while Agent 1 receives items 4 and 0. This allocation ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items.
