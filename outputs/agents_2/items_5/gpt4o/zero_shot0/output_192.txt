Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  12  41   2  80
1  88  85  38  55  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent gets. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates items based on the highest relative valuations.

Here are the steps involved in the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items combined.
2. Allocate each item to the agent for whom the item has the highest value, considering the overall distribution to keep things fair.

Let's calculate and allocate the items:

For each item, we'll consider the value each agent places on it:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 at 88. 
  - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).
  
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 85. 
  - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).
  
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 at 38. 
  - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).
  
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 at 55. 
  - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).
  
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 at 90. 
  - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

Allocating based on these observations provides a fair distribution where each agent gets a set of items that maximizes their individual total valuation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
