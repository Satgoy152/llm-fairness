Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  13  94   0  26
1   4  28  96  78  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to assign items based on the highest value an agent places on them, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total value.

Let's evaluate the values each agent places on each item and allocate accordingly:

- Agent 0 values: [29, 13, 94, 0, 26]
- Agent 1 values: [4, 28, 96, 78, 85]

**Allocation Strategy:**
1. For item 2, Agent 1 values it the highest (96) compared to Agent 0 (94). Allocate to Agent 1.
2. For item 3, Agent 1 values it (78) compared to Agent 0 (0). Allocate to Agent 1.
3. For item 4, Agent 1 values it (85) compared to Agent 0 (26). Allocate to Agent 1.
4. For item 0, Agent 0 values it (29) compared to Agent 1 (4). Allocate to Agent 0.
5. For item 1, Agent 1 values it (28) compared to Agent 0 (13). Allocate to Agent 1.

After this allocation, let's check the total value for each agent:
- Agent 0: [item 0] = 29
- Agent 1: [items 1, 2, 3, 4] = 28 + 96 + 78 + 85 = 287

The allocation is not balanced. To balance it better, let's re-evaluate:
Agent 0 should receive more than just item 0 to make the allocation fairer. Let's adjust by giving:
- Items with values that are closer in valuation to Agent 0.

Revised Allocation:
- Give item 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Give items 2, 3, and 4 to Agent 1.

This ensures:
- Agent 0: [items 0, 1] = 29 + 13 = 42
- Agent 1: [items 2, 3, 4] = 96 + 78 + 85 = 259

The adjusted allocation ensures a better balance in terms of item quantity, though the total value is still skewed, reflecting the inherent imbalance in the initial valuations. However, in terms of item distribution:

Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
