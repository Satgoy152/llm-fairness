Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  21  75   5  38
1  82  61  33  49  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. One common approach is to use the "Greedy Allocation" method, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that both agents get an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 76, and Agent 1 values it at 82. So, allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 21, and Agent 1 values it at 61. So, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 75, and Agent 1 values it at 33. So, allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 5, and Agent 1 values it at 49. So, allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 38, and Agent 1 values it at 85. So, allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Currently, Agent 0 has 1 item, and Agent 1 has 4 items. To balance this, let's re-evaluate to ensure that both agents have a fair number of items:

Re-evaluate by looking at the next highest valuations:

- **Item 0**: Switch to Agent 0 (total items: Agent 0 = 2, Agent 1 = 3)
- **Item 2**: Keep with Agent 0

Now, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 4]

This gives a fair distribution where each agent receives a reasonable number of items. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
