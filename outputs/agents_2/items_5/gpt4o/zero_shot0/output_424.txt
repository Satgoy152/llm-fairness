Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  60  47  95  86
1  83  17  68  88  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can employ a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives. This approach is similar to solving a bipartite matching problem where we aim to maximize the sum of the values assigned to each agent.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation:

### Agent 0:
- Valuation for items: 
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 95
  - Item 4: 86

### Agent 1:
- Valuation for items:
  - Item 0: 83
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 68
  - Item 3: 88
  - Item 4: 14

To determine an optimal allocation, we can compare the valuations for each item and assign items to the agent who values them more. We also need to ensure that the total number of items is fairly distributed, meaning each agent gets an integer number of items.

#### Allocation Process:
1. Compare each item's valuation between the two agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation.
3. Adjust if necessary to ensure a fair distribution of items.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (83 vs. 81).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (60 vs. 17).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (68 vs. 47).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (95 vs. 88).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (86 vs. 14).

#### Preliminary Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2

This gives a fair distribution, with each agent receiving 2 or 3 items, which is acceptable for this small set.

Now, let's format this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair number of items and maximizes their total valuations based on the given data.
