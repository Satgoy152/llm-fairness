Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  94  96   0  98
1  66  97  40  24  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider the valuations given by each agent and aim to maximize the total value for both while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the values provided by each agent for each item:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 0
  - Item 4: 98

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 40
  - Item 3: 24
  - Item 4: 71

We will try to allocate items to maximize the perceived value for each agent, considering their preferences.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values this item more (66 vs. 18).
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values this item slightly more (97 vs. 94), but both have close valuations.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this item more (96 vs. 40).
4. **Item 3:** Agent 1 values this item more (24 vs. 0).
5. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values this item more (98 vs. 71).

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 1, 2, 4
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 3

The proposed allocation tries to balance the total value perceived by each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
