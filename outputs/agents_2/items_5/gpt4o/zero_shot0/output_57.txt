Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  69  60   4  86
1  74  79  49  53  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [74 79 49 53 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Let's explore a possible allocation:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for All Possible Allocations
1. **Agent 0:** Valuation [11, 69, 60, 4, 86]
2. **Agent 1:** Valuation [74, 79, 49, 53, 55]

### Step 2: Allocate Items to Maximize Fairness

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 11, and Agent 1 values it at 74.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 69, and Agent 1 values it at 79.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 60, and Agent 1 values it at 49.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 4, and Agent 1 values it at 53.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 86, and Agent 1 values it at 55.

### Step 3: Choose Allocation

After reviewing the valuations, we can allocate items to maximize each agent's utility:

- Allocate items [0, 2, 4] to Agent 0:
  - Total value: 11 + 60 + 86 = 157

- Allocate items [1, 3] to Agent 1:
  - Total value: 79 + 53 = 132

### Step 4: Present the Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with Agent 0 receiving three items due to their higher valuation of those items, and Agent 1 receiving two items.
