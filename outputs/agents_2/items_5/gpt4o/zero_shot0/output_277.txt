Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  72   9  32  44
1  99  96  58  43  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 32
  - Item 4: 44

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 96
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 43
  - Item 4: 68

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a method that attempts to distribute items such that the difference in total valuation between the agents is minimized.

1. Start by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most:

   - Item 0: Agent 1 (99 > 26)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (96 > 72)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (58 > 9)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (32 > 43 is false, Agent 1)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (68 > 44)

2. Current Allocation:
   - Agent 0: []
   - Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

This allocation is heavily skewed towards Agent 1, so we need to adjust to ensure both agents receive some items. Let's look for a fairer allocation:

- Agent 0 should get the item they value relatively equally or more than Agent 1, considering the remaining items.
  
- Reassign Item 3 to Agent 0, where Agent 0 values it at 32 and Agent 1 at 43. This helps in balancing.
  
- Reassign Item 4 to Agent 0, where Agent 0 values it at 44 and Agent 1 at 68.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 two items and Agent 1 three items while aiming to balance their total valuations.
