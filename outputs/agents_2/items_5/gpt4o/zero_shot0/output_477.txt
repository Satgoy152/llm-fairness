Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  32  86  76  39
1  29  92  31  31  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple algorithm that tries to optimize the allocation based on the agents' valuations. One approach is to use a "maximum sum of valuations" strategy, where we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's consider each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 96, and Agent 1 values it at 29. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 32, and Agent 1 values it at 92. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 86, and Agent 1 values it at 31. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 76, and Agent 1 values it at 31. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 39, and Agent 1 values it at 98. Allocate to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation can be done as follows:

Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 3.

Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
