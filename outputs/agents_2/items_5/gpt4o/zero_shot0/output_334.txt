Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  40  79  10  25
1  82  40  85  60   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to assign items such that the total valuation of items for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 79
  - Item 3: 10
  - Item 4: 25

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 82
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 85
  - Item 3: 60
  - Item 4: 2

To start, a simple way to allocate is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's check the values for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (82).
- Item 1: Both agents value it equally (40 each), but we can assign it to Agent 0 to balance the allocations.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (85).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (60).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (25).

Based on the above preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: [1, 4]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 2, 3]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
