Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  38  71  29  37
1  58   5  70  87  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. A common approach is to use the "maximin" strategy, which attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item by both agents:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values at 28, Agent 1 values at 58
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values at 38, Agent 1 values at 5
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values at 71, Agent 1 values at 70
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values at 29, Agent 1 values at 87
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values at 37, Agent 1 values at 22

2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more to maximize total valuation:
   - Item 0: Assigned to Agent 1 (58 > 28)
   - Item 1: Assigned to Agent 0 (38 > 5)
   - Item 2: Assigned to Agent 0 (71 > 70)
   - Item 3: Assigned to Agent 1 (87 > 29)
   - Item 4: Assigned to Agent 0 (37 > 22)

3. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, which is already satisfied in this allocation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

Here, Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 4, while Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3. This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their individual valuations.
