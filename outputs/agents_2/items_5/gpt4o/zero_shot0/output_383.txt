Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  52  21  75  81
1  94  67  73  12  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction (or total valuation) each agent derives from their assigned items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can employ a greedy approach to achieve this. Here's how we can allocate the items:

Agent 0's valuations: [11, 52, 21, 75, 81]
Agent 1's valuations: [94, 67, 73, 12, 46]

To fairly allocate the items, we'll try to maximize the total valuation for each agent. One way to do this is to consider the difference in valuations for each item and decide based on which agent values the item more.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing the valuation differences:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 94, and Agent 0 values it at 11. Agent 1 values it more significantly, so allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 67, and Agent 0 values it at 52. Agent 1 values it more, so allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 73, and Agent 0 values it at 21. Agent 1 values it more, so allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 75, and Agent 1 values it at 12. Agent 0 values it more, so allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 81, and Agent 1 values it at 46. Agent 0 values it more, so allocate to Agent 0.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2

Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
