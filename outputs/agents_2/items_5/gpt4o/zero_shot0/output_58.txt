Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  66  6  70  26  43
1   1  5  38  87  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuation for each item. Let's look at the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 66
- Item 1: 6
- Item 2: 70
- Item 3: 26
- Item 4: 43

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 1
- Item 1: 5
- Item 2: 38
- Item 3: 87
- Item 4: 82

Here, one common approach is to use a "greedy allocation" where each item is given to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 values it at 1. 
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 values it at 5.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 values it at 38.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 87.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 values it at 82.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 1 gets items: [3, 4]

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
