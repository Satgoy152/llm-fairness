Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  31  80  17  90
1  36  74  93  38   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations of the items and aim for a distribution where the total value of items for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's look at the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 46
- Item 1: 31
- Item 2: 80
- Item 3: 17
- Item 4: 90

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 36
- Item 1: 74
- Item 2: 93
- Item 3: 38
- Item 4: 1

A possible fair allocation strategy is to maximize the satisfaction of both agents by considering the items they value the most. We can follow a greedy approach where we allocate items starting from the one with the highest valuation to the respective agent.

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (93). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 4 the most (90). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 0's next highest value is item 2, but it's already assigned. Next, item 0 has the highest value (46). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 1's next highest valued item available is item 1 (74). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
5. The remaining item is item 3, which can be assigned to either agent. Given the previous allocations, we will assign it to Agent 0 to balance the number of items, as Agent 0 has fewer items.

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items [0, 3, 4] and Agent 1 the items [1, 2], aiming to balance the total value perceived by each agent based on their initial valuations.
