Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73   1  43  66   4
1  63  44  87  40  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility for both agents. We aim to assign items such that the total valuation for each agent is balanced, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 73
- Item 1: 1
- Item 2: 43
- Item 3: 66
- Item 4: 4

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 63
- Item 1: 44
- Item 2: 87
- Item 3: 40
- Item 4: 13

To find a fair allocation, we can apply a simple approach by manually evaluating the best distribution based on valuations:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item significantly more than Agent 0 (87 vs. 43). Therefore, allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item more than Agent 1 (73 vs. 63). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item more than Agent 1 (66 vs. 40). Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item more than Agent 0 (44 vs. 1). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item more than Agent 0 (13 vs. 4). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, and 4.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
