Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  50  16  87  72
1  19   9  21   1   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the combined value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **List the items and their valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: 
     - Item 0: 99
     - Item 1: 50
     - Item 2: 16
     - Item 3: 87
     - Item 4: 72

   - Agent 1:
     - Item 0: 19
     - Item 1: 9
     - Item 2: 21
     - Item 3: 1
     - Item 4: 8

2. **Sort items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents:**

   - Item 0: Difference = 99 - 19 = 80
   - Item 3: Difference = 87 - 1 = 86
   - Item 4: Difference = 72 - 8 = 64
   - Item 1: Difference = 50 - 9 = 41
   - Item 2: Difference = 16 - 21 = -5

   Items sorted by difference (from highest to lowest): 0, 3, 4, 1, 2

3. **Allocate items to maximize individual agent's total value:**

   - Agent 0 should get items where their valuation difference is highest compared to Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 should get items where the difference is smallest or negative.

4. **Allocate items based on sorted differences:**

   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 4
   - Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2

5. **Resulting Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, maximizing each agent's total perceived value of the items they receive.
