Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2  3   4
0  97  61  90  4   0
1  21  15  26  5  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the following approach: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation would look:

- For item 0, Agent 0 values it at 97 and Agent 1 values it at 21. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- For item 1, Agent 0 values it at 61 and Agent 1 values it at 15. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- For item 2, Agent 0 values it at 90 and Agent 1 values it at 26. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- For item 3, Agent 0 values it at 4 and Agent 1 values it at 5. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- For item 4, Agent 0 values it at 0 and Agent 1 values it at 32. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
