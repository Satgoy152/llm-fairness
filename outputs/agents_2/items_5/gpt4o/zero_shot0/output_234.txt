Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  35  63  90  93
1  38  10  38  47  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Values: [15, 35, 63, 90, 93]  
   - Total value if Agent 0 gets all items: 15 + 35 + 63 + 90 + 93 = 296

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Values: [38, 10, 38, 47, 44]  
   - Total value if Agent 1 gets all items: 38 + 10 + 38 + 47 + 44 = 177

We can aim to balance the distribution of high-value items between the two agents. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

To achieve this, we can allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0 gets items 2, 3, 4:**
  - Value for Agent 0: 63 + 90 + 93 = 246
- **Agent 1 gets items 0, 1:**
  - Value for Agent 1: 38 + 10 = 48

This allocation maximizes the value for each agent given their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
