Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  13  81  42  63
1  43  82  13  42  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's evaluate the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 values it at 43
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 82
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 values it at 13
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 values it at 42
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 values it at 73

A fair allocation would try to maximize each agent's total satisfaction while ensuring fairness. One way to do this is to allocate items based on the highest valuation difference between agents.

1. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1** because Agent 1 values it significantly higher (82 vs. 13).
2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0** because Agent 0 values it significantly higher (81 vs. 13).
3. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1** because Agent 1 values it slightly higher (73 vs. 63).
4. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0** because Agent 0 values it higher (60 vs. 43).
5. **Assign Item 3** can go to either agent since both value it equally, but to balance the number of items, we'll give it to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and attempts to maximize their total satisfaction based on their valuations. The allocations can be represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
