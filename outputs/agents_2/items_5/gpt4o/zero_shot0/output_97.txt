Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2  3   4
0  57   8   7  7   0
1  47  24  84  7  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. The goal is to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as fair as possible.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of one possible fair allocation:

1. **Valuation Matrix:**

   | Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
   |------------|----|----|----|----|----|
   | 0          | 57 | 8  | 7  | 7  | 0  |
   | 1          | 47 | 24 | 84 | 7  | 65 |

2. **Assign Items:**
   - Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no conflicts in assignment.
   - For Agent 0, the highest value is 57 for item 0.
   - For Agent 1, the highest value is 84 for item 2.

   Initial assignment:
   - Agent 0: [0]
   - Agent 1: [2]

3. **Assign Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate remaining items to balance the total valuation as closely as possible.

   Continuing:
   - Agent 1 values item 4 (65) highly. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 has already item 0, next best available unassigned is item 1 (8).
   - For item 3, Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0, but to balance out the allocation, we assign it to Agent 0.

   After these allocations:
   - Agent 0: [0, 1, 3]
   - Agent 1: [2, 4]

4. **Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the total valuation based on their preferences.
