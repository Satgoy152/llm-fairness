Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  59  27  66  29
1  30  98  95  40  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. A simple approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most. Here's how we can allocate items based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 43, and Agent 1 values it at 30. Assign it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 59, and Agent 1 values it at 98. Assign it to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 27, and Agent 1 values it at 95. Assign it to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 66, and Agent 1 values it at 40. Assign it to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 29, and Agent 1 values it at 11. Assign it to Agent 0.

Based on this allocation, we ensure that each agent gets items they value highly. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
