Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  85  62  43  50
1  35  49  22  93  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that the total value of the items each agent receives is as equitable as possible. Let's evaluate the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: Value 36
   - Item 1: Value 85
   - Item 2: Value 62
   - Item 3: Value 43
   - Item 4: Value 50

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0: Value 35
   - Item 1: Value 49
   - Item 2: Value 22
   - Item 3: Value 93
   - Item 4: Value 79

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them more until all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Allocate items that Agent 0 values significantly more than Agent 1.
- **Agent 1:** Allocate items that Agent 1 values significantly more than Agent 0.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Compare each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (36) vs Agent 1 (35) → Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (85) vs Agent 1 (49) → Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (62) vs Agent 1 (22) → Allocate to Agent 0
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (43) vs Agent 1 (93) → Allocate to Agent 1
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (50) vs Agent 1 (79) → Allocate to Agent 1

This allocation results in:

- **Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.**
- **Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.**

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
