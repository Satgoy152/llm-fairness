Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  67   8  81   2
1  69  74  22  84  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for a distribution that maximizes total satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate total valuation for each agent:**
    - Agent 0's total valuation: 65 + 67 + 8 + 81 + 2 = 223
    - Agent 1's total valuation: 69 + 74 + 22 + 84 + 50 = 299

2. **Allocate items to maximize each agentâ€™s satisfaction:**
    - Consider the highest value items for each agent and try to allocate them to the agent who values them the most.

3. **Allocation strategy:**
    - Agent 0 highly values item 3 (81) and item 0 (65).
    - Agent 1 highly values item 3 (84), item 1 (74), and item 4 (50).

4. **Fair allocation proposal:**
    - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
    - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
    - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
    - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

5. **Final allocation:**
    - Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
    - Agent 1: Items 1, 3, and 4

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to consider the highest values for each agent and distributes the items in a way that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.
