Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  73  92  86  58
1  87  45  52  59  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here is the step-by-step allocation process:

1. Compare the value each agent has for each item.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it higher.

Let's evaluate each item's value for both agents:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 13
  - Agent 1 values it at 87
  - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value)

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0 values it at 73
  - Agent 1 values it at 45
  - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value)

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0 values it at 92
  - Agent 1 values it at 52
  - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value)

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 86
  - Agent 1 values it at 59
  - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value)

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0 values it at 58
  - Agent 1 values it at 60
  - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value)

Based on the above evaluations, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
