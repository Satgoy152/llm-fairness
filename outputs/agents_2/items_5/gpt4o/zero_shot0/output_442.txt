Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  49  82  61   3
1  48  67  68   0  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will try to distribute items such that the overall happiness (valuation) is maximized for each agent.

Let's first calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation:

1. Assign items based on highest individual item values for each agent. 

   Agent 0's valuations: [28, 49, 82, 61, 3]  
   Agent 1's valuations: [48, 67, 68, 0, 57]

   Let's allocate based on the highest value for each item:

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 48, Agent 0 values it at 28. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 67, Agent 0 values it at 49. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 values it at 68. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 57, Agent 0 values it at 3. Assign to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures the items are distributed to maximize each agent's valuation based on individual item preferences.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3, while Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 4. This way, each agent gets the items they value more, resulting in a fair allocation.
