Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60   4  23  62  40
1  61  39  88  62  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We will try to allocate the items such that the sum of the values for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 60 + 4 + 23 + 62 + 40 = 189
   - Agent 1: 61 + 39 + 88 + 62 + 95 = 345

2. Allocate items to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

By examining the valuations, we can aim to allocate items to maximize the fairness in terms of total value:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 88 for Agent 1 vs. value 23 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 95 for Agent 1 vs. value 40 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 62 for both agents, so it doesn't affect fairness much).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 61 for Agent 1 vs. value 60 for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 4 for Agent 0 vs. value 39 for Agent 1).

This way, we try to balance the allocations to ensure fairness. The allocation might not be perfect, but it attempts to consider the highest values for each agent.

The final allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3, and Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 4. This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.
