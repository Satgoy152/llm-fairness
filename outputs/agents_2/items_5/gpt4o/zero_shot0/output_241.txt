Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  12  87  28  42
1  88  25  30  14  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's look at the valuations for each item and assign them to the agent who values them the most:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values at 15
   - Agent 1 values at 88
   - Assign to Agent 1

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values at 12
   - Agent 1 values at 25
   - Assign to Agent 1

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values at 87
   - Agent 1 values at 30
   - Assign to Agent 0

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values at 28
   - Agent 1 values at 14
   - Assign to Agent 0

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values at 42
   - Agent 1 values at 56
   - Assign to Agent 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
