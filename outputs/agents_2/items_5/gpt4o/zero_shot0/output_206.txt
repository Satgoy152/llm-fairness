Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  56  99  12  38
1  33  32  91   5  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 56 99 12 38]
 [33 32 91  5 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's first examine the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [63, 56, 99, 12, 38]
Agent 1: [33, 32, 91, 5, 91]
```

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items to maximize the fairness in terms of value received by each agent:

1. **Item 2** has the highest value overall for both agents. Agent 0 values it at 99, and Agent 1 values it at 91. To maximize fairness, we can give this high-value item to Agent 0 since it provides the largest difference in value.

2. **Item 4** is valued at 91 by Agent 1, which is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation (38). Thus, it is fair to allocate this item to Agent 1.

3. **Item 0** is valued at 63 by Agent 0 and only 33 by Agent 1. Allocate this to Agent 0.

4. **Item 1** is valued at 56 by Agent 0 and 32 by Agent 1. Allocate this to Agent 0.

5. **Item 3** is valued at 12 by Agent 0 and 5 by Agent 1. Allocate this to Agent 1, as Agent 0 already has a higher total value of items.

With this allocation, we ensure that both agents get the maximum value possible from the items they receive.

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
