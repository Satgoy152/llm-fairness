Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  42  96  22  50
1  22  24  55   5  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of both agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a method that considers both the value each agent places on items and the total number of items available.

Here’s one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 34 + 42 + 96 + 22 + 50 = 244
   - Agent 1: 22 + 24 + 55 + 5 + 97 = 203

2. Consider a fair division based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction. We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, then adjust if needed to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

3. Assign items based on highest individual values:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 at 22 → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 at 24 → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 at 55 → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 5 → Assign to Agent 0
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 at 97 → Assign to Agent 1

4. Review the allocation to ensure fairness in terms of the number of items and satisfaction:
   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2, 3
   - Agent 1 receives items: 4

Since Agent 0 has more items, we can check if redistributing one item could improve fairness without significantly reducing satisfaction.

Reassign item 3 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2
   - Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4

This distribution ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is more balanced in terms of the number of items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
