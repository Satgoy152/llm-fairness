Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  66  79  31   9
1  92  13  36  33  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of value based on their preferences. We will consider the valuations of both agents for each item and try to allocate items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [42, 66, 79, 31, 9]
Agent 1: [92, 13, 36, 33, 86]
```

We can first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 42 + 66 + 79 + 31 + 9 = 227
- Total value for Agent 1: 92 + 13 + 36 + 33 + 86 = 260

Next, to fairly allocate the items, let's aim to balance the total value of items each agent receives as closely as possible to their total valuation.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Allocate the items based on the highest relative value to each agent.

2. **Review and Adjust**:
   - Ensure that no agent feels under-compensated by assessing any possible adjustments that could improve the fairness.

### Allocation

1. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (92)
   - Second highest value item: Item 4 (86)

2. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (79)
   - Second highest value item: Item 1 (66)
   - Remaining item: Item 3 (31)

By distributing in this way, we have:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2, 3
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 66 + 79 + 31 = 176

- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 4
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 92 + 86 = 178

The allocations are fairly balanced regarding the total perceived value by each agent.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives both agents a reasonable and nearly equal total value according to their preferences.
