Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  57  38  82  46
1  19  89  84  78  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing each agent's total valuation for their allocated items. Let's analyze the given valuation matrix:

```
Agents\Items   0   1   2   3   4
Agent 0        13  57  38  82  46
Agent 1        19  89  84  78  25
```

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify Key Items**:
    - For each item, identify which agent values it more.
    - Compare each column to determine which agent should ideally receive each item.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**:
    - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (19 vs. 13)
    - Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (89 vs. 57)
    - Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (84 vs. 38)
    - Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (82 vs. 78)
    - Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (46 vs. 25)

3. **Balance the Number of Items**:
    - We need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, so we balance the allocations considering the total valuation.

4. **Final Allocation**:
    - Agent 0 gets items: 3, 4 (valuations: 82 + 46 = 128)
    - Agent 1 gets items: 0, 1, 2 (valuations: 19 + 89 + 84 = 192)

By allocating in this manner, we balance the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

### JSON Representation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations while respecting the requirement of integer items per agent.
