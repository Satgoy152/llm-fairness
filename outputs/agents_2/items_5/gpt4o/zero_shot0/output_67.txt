Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  65  19  64  61
1  62  20  31  66   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total valuation, while also ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation
For each agent, calculate the total valuation for all items:
- Agent 0: 30 + 65 + 19 + 64 + 61 = 239
- Agent 1: 62 + 20 + 31 + 66 + 8 = 187

### Step 2: Allocate Items
We aim to allocate the items in a way that balances the valuations as much as possible.

#### Initial Allocation:
1.  Assign the highest valued items to each agent:
    - Agent 0: Item 3 (64)
    - Agent 1: Item 3 (66)

2. Assign remaining items trying to balance total valuations:
    - Agent 0: Item 1 (65), Item 4 (61)
    - Agent 1: Item 0 (62), Item 2 (31)

#### Review Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 1, 4
  - Total Valuation: 64 + 65 + 61 = 190
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
  - Total Valuation: 62 + 31 = 93 (adjustment needed)

#### Adjustments:
We need to adjust to make the allocation fairer. Let's try swapping items between agents to balance the valuations:

- Swap Item 4 from Agent 0 with Item 0 from Agent 1.

#### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 1, 0
  - Total Valuation: 64 + 65 + 62 = 191
- Agent 1: Items 4, 2
  - Total Valuation: 61 + 31 = 92

This allocation is balanced considering both agents have almost equal total valuations with a slight difference. Now, let's express these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 0],
    "1": [4, 2]
}
```
