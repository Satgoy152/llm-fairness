Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  55  50   5  75
1  88  91  42  46  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. 

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 50
  - Item 3: 5
  - Item 4: 75

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 46
  - Item 4: 60

To allocate the items fairly, we can try the following approach:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them most until all items are allocated.
2. Ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (88 vs 36), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (91 vs 55), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (50 vs 42), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (46 vs 5), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (75 vs 60), allocate to Agent 0.

Now we check the allocation:
- Agent 0 has items: 2, 4
- Agent 1 has items: 0, 1, 3

Each agent has an integer number of items (2 for Agent 0 and 3 for Agent 1).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
