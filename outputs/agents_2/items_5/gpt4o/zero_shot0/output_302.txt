Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  12  58  26  19
1  81  79  75  41  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll aim to distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible based on the given valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 26
  - Item 4: 19

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 79
  - Item 2: 75
  - Item 3: 41
  - Item 4: 28

We can observe the following:

1. Item 0 has a higher value for Agent 1 (81) than for Agent 0 (28).
2. Item 1 has a higher value for Agent 1 (79) than for Agent 0 (12).
3. Item 2 has a higher value for Agent 0 (58) than for Agent 1 (75), but the difference is not huge.
4. Item 3 has a higher value for Agent 0 (26) than for Agent 1 (41), but Agent 1 values it more.
5. Item 4 has a higher value for Agent 1 (28) than for Agent 0 (19).

Based on these observations, we can allocate items as follows to maximize fairness and total value for both agents:

- Allocate items 0, 1, and 4 to Agent 1, as these items have significantly higher values for Agent 1.
- Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 0, as these items have relatively higher values for Agent 0 or smaller differences.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
