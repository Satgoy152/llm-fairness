Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  26  24   2  15
1  34  97  76  56   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1), we need to consider their valuations for each item and attempt to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. List the valuations for each item for both agents:

   - Agent 0: [68, 26, 24, 2, 15]
   - Agent 1: [34, 97, 76, 56, 8]

2. Calculate the total valuation for all items for each agent:

   - Total valuation for Agent 0: 68 + 26 + 24 + 2 + 15 = 135
   - Total valuation for Agent 1: 34 + 97 + 76 + 56 + 8 = 271

3. Consider each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, while trying to balance the total valuation:

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 at 34. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 at 97. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 at 76. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 at 56. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 at 8. Allocate to Agent 0.

4. Review the allocation:

   - Agent 0 receives items [0, 4]
   - Agent 1 receives items [1, 2, 3]

5. Calculate the total valuation for each agent based on the allocation:

   - Agent 0: 68 (item 0) + 15 (item 4) = 83
   - Agent 1: 97 (item 1) + 76 (item 2) + 56 (item 3) = 229

6. Present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.
