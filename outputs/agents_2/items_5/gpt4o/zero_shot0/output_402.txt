Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  19  12  80  12
1  43  37  86  96  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [43 37 86 96 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. One approach is to use the "Maximum Weighted Matching" method, which aims to maximize the sum of the valuations of the assigned items.

Given the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  19  12  80  12
1  43  37  86  96  20
```

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 52
- Item 1: 19
- Item 2: 12
- Item 3: 80
- Item 4: 12

Agent 1 values:
- Item 0: 43
- Item 1: 37
- Item 2: 86
- Item 3: 96
- Item 4: 20

To allocate the items fairly, we want to ensure that the total value each agent gets is balanced as much as possible. One potential allocation could be:

- Assign items to Agent 0 such that their total value is maximized while keeping the allocation fair.
- Assign items to Agent 1 similarly.

Let's consider an allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 52 for Agent 0, 43 for Agent 1)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 19 for Agent 0, 37 for Agent 1)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 12 for Agent 0, 86 for Agent 1)
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 80 for Agent 0, 96 for Agent 1)
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 12 for Agent 0, 20 for Agent 1)

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 4 with total valuation 52 + 80 + 12 = 144
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2 with total valuation 37 + 86 = 123

This allocation ensures that both agents get a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
