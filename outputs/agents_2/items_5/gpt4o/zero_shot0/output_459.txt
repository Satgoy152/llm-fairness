Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  80  74  86  52
1  70  56  88  84  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items based on the highest value for each agent, keeping track of the total value each agent receives.

Let's analyze the given values:

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 81
- Item 1: 80
- Item 2: 74
- Item 3: 86
- Item 4: 52

Agent 1 values:
- Item 0: 70
- Item 1: 56
- Item 2: 88
- Item 3: 84
- Item 4: 66

We'll start by assigning the highest-value item to each agent alternately until all items are allocated.

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for Item 3 (value 86).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for Item 2 (value 88).
3. Next, Agent 0 has the highest value for Item 0 (value 81).
4. Agent 1 has the highest value for Item 4 (value 66).
5. Finally, the remaining item, Item 1, goes to Agent 0.

After allocation, the assignments are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4

Representing these allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
