Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  26  12   4  94
1  95  38  58  69  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 38 58 69 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [4, 26, 12, 4, 94]
Agent 1: [95, 38, 58, 69, 71]
```

Let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's perceived value while ensuring fairness:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 4.
   - Agent 1 values it at 95.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 26.
   - Agent 1 values it at 38.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 12.
   - Agent 1 values it at 58.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 4.
   - Agent 1 values it at 69.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 94.
   - Agent 1 values it at 71.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is fair. We can adjust by giving one of the less valuable items to Agent 0 to balance the number of items:

- Transfer Item 1 from Agent 1 to Agent 0.

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 2, 3

Presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
