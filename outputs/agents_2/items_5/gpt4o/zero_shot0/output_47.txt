Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  91  87  87  94
1  55  19  14  95  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple algorithm like the "maximizing sum of allocations" method. This involves assigning items to agents such that the total value each agent receives is maximized based on their individual valuations.

We have two agents (0 and 1) and five items (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4). The goal is to ensure each agent receives a fair allocation of items based on their preferences.

### Steps to Allocate:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**:
   - For agent 0:
     - Total valuation = 95 + 91 + 87 + 87 + 94 = 464
   - For agent 1:
     - Total valuation = 55 + 19 + 14 + 95 + 45 = 228

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Individual Agent Value**:
   - We aim to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences.

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Values items highly across all instances but particularly item 0 and 4.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the most, followed by item 0.

Considering these observations, a fair allocation can be:

- **Agent 0**: Receives items 0, 1, and 4.
  - Total value for agent 0 = 95 (item 0) + 91 (item 1) + 94 (item 4) = 280
- **Agent 1**: Receives items 2 and 3.
  - Total value for agent 1 = 14 (item 2) + 95 (item 3) = 109

This allocation provides a reasonably fair distribution based on their preferences and ensures both agents receive at least one of their high-value items.

### JSON Format Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
