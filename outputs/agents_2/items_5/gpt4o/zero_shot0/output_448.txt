Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  15  46  83  88
1  63  28  93  18  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A common approach is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" method, also known as the "greedy allocation" method. Here's how we can do it:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items one by one, giving each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Adjust the allocation if necessary to ensure fairness, such as by swapping items between agents to balance the total valuation.

Let's see how these steps apply to the given data:

Agent 0's valuations: [11, 15, 46, 83, 88]  
Agent 1's valuations: [63, 28, 93, 18, 37]

Firstly, let's allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 63, higher than Agent 0's 11.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 28, higher than Agent 0's 15.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 93, higher than Agent 0's 46.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 83, higher than Agent 1's 18.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 88, higher than Agent 1's 37.

Initial allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 2]

Both agents receive an integer number of items. However, to ensure fairness, we can calculate the total valuation each agent receives and check for significant imbalance:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 83 (for item 3) + 88 (for item 4) = 171
- Agent 1's total valuation: 63 (for item 0) + 28 (for item 1) + 93 (for item 2) = 184

The allocation seems reasonably fair, given that the total valuation difference is minimal.

Therefore, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
