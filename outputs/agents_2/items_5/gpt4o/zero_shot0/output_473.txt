Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  99  74  68  10
1  63  54  23  34   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them items they value more. We can use a simple greedy algorithm to achieve this, where we assign items based on the highest value for each agent until all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Start by listing all items and their values for both agents:

   - Agent 0: [60, 99, 74, 68, 10]
   - Agent 1: [63, 54, 23, 34, 1]

2. Assign items to the agent who values them more:

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 63, higher than Agent 0's 60. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 99, higher than Agent 1's 54. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 74, higher than Agent 1's 23. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 68, higher than Agent 1's 34. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 10, higher than Agent 1's 1. Assign to Agent 0.

3. Check allocations:
   - Agent 0 receives items [1, 2, 3, 4].
   - Agent 1 receives item [0].

Now, provide the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0]
}
```
