Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  70  85  83  84
1  33  17  15  86  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 22 + 70 + 85 + 83 + 84 = 344
   - Agent 1: 33 + 17 + 15 + 86 + 82 = 233

2. Allocate items to maximize the overall satisfaction:
   - Agent 0 highly values items 2, 3, and 4. 
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3 and 4.

3. We will try to distribute items so that the combined value for each agent is fair, considering their preferences.

Let's allocate the items:

- Give item 0 to Agent 1 (33 > 22)
- Give item 1 to Agent 0 (70 > 17)
- Give item 2 to Agent 0 (85 > 15)
- Give item 3 to Agent 1 (86 > 83)
- Give item 4 to Agent 0 (84 > 82)

The allocations would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Agent 0 receives items they value highly, and Agent 1 receives the items that also maximize their valuation.
