Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  29  45  48  14
1  71  48   3  75  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [71 48  3 75 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can aim for a solution where each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total valuation, while keeping the allocation fair.

The valuation table is as follows:

```
    Item
    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  29  45  48  14  (Agent 0)
1  71  48   3  75  91  (Agent 1)
```

Let's calculate the optimal allocation by ensuring each agent gets a balanced share of the items based on their valuations:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it higher (71 vs 50).
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it higher (48 vs 29).
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it higher (45 vs 3).
4. **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it higher (75 vs 48).
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it higher (91 vs 14).

Given the above, a fair allocation could be to give Agent 0 Item 2, and Agent 1 the rest of the items (0, 1, 3, and 4), since Agent 1 values those items significantly higher.

Therefore, a fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```
