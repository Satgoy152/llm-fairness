Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  55  50  42  93
1  74  35  91  45  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 35 91 45 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the "envy-free" approach, which seeks to ensure that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the other's allocation.

Let's look at the valuations table:

```
      0   1   2   3   4
0   91  55  50  42  93
1   74  35  91  45  33
```

First, we calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 91 + 55 + 50 + 42 + 93 = 331
- Agent 1: 74 + 35 + 91 + 45 + 33 = 278

Next, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as equal as possible.

We'll allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 91, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 74. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 55, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 35. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 91, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 50. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 42, which is slightly lower than Agent 1's valuation of 45. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 93, which is significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation of 33. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 4] with total valuation = 91 + 55 + 93 = 239
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 3] with total valuation = 91 + 45 = 136

While not perfectly equal in total valuation due to the integers constraint, this distribution ensures that each agent gets items they highly value.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
