Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  51  31  69  43
1  29  57  19  76  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach to achieve this is to use a method such as "envy-free" allocation if possible. Given the valuations, we can try to balance the total value each agent gets.

Let's consider the valuations:
- Agent 0 values: 82, 51, 31, 69, 43
- Agent 1 values: 29, 57, 19, 76, 25

The total value each agent assigns to all items is:
- Agent 0: 82 + 51 + 31 + 69 + 43 = 276
- Agent 1: 29 + 57 + 19 + 76 + 25 = 206

To allocate items fairly, we can use a greedy approach where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives.

Allocation process:
1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (82 vs. 29), allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (57 vs. 51), allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (31 vs. 19), allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (76 vs. 69), allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (43 vs. 25), allocate to Agent 0.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of high-value items according to their preferences.
