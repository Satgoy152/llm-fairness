Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  93  20  11  71
1  10  65  74  31  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's evaluate the optimal allocation:

Agent 0:
- Values: [2, 93, 20, 11, 71]

Agent 1:
- Values: [10, 65, 74, 31, 55]

### Allocation Process:
1. **Highest Valuation Strategy**:
   - Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item.

2. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 2 and Agent 1 values it at 10.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 93 and Agent 1 values it at 65.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 20 and Agent 1 values it at 74.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 11 and Agent 1 values it at 31.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

6. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 71 and Agent 1 values it at 55.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items they value higher: Item 1 and Item 4.
- Agent 1 receives items they value higher: Item 0, Item 2, and Item 3.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest preferences, aiming for a fair distribution based on their valuations.
