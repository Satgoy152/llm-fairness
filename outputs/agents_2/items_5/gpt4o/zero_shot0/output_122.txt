Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  34  40  16  88
1  26   2  83  12  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their valuations for each item. We'll use a simple approach by greedily assigning the highest-valued items to each agent until all items are allocated.

1. **List all items with their valuations for both agents:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 values it at 26
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 2
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 values it at 83
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 values it at 12
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 values it at 78

2. **Calculate the difference in valuations for each item (Agent 1 value - Agent 0 value):**

   - Item 0: -5
   - Item 1: -32
   - Item 2: 43
   - Item 3: -4
   - Item 4: -10

3. **Sort items by the absolute value of the difference, prioritizing allocation to the agent who values the item more:**

   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it significantly more
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it significantly more
   - Item 4: Both agents value it highly, but Agent 0 slightly more
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it slightly more
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it slightly more

4. **Allocate items to maximize each agent's total value:**

   - Give Item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has a much higher valuation)
   - Give Item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 has a much higher valuation)
   - Give Item 4 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it slightly more)
   - Give Item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it slightly more)
   - Give Item 3 to Agent 1 (Agent 0 values it slightly more, but to balance item count)

5. **Final allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 three items (0, 1, 4) and Agent 1 two items (2, 3), aiming to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.
