Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  20  21  71  21
1  97  75  35  85  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [18, 20, 21, 71, 21]
Agent 1: [97, 75, 35, 85, 16]
```

Let's try to allocate in such a way that the allocations are fair.

1. **Item 3**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (85) compared to Agent 0 (71). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it more (21) than Agent 1 (16). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 1**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation (75) than Agent 0 (20). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it (21) more than Agent 1 (35). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it significantly more (97) than Agent 0 (18). Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3

Let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
