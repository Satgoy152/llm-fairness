Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  98  69  32  22
1  96  82  41  17  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. We will try to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is maximized while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the items:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 94
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 69
  - Item 3: 32
  - Item 4: 22

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 96
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 41
  - Item 3: 17
  - Item 4: 86

One possible fair allocation strategy is to alternate assignments based on the highest valuations for each item between the two agents:

1. Item 0 is valued higher by Agent 1 (96 > 94).
2. Item 1 is valued higher by Agent 0 (98 > 82).
3. Item 2 is valued higher by Agent 0 (69 > 41).
4. Item 3 is valued higher by Agent 0 (32 > 17).
5. Item 4 is valued higher by Agent 1 (86 > 22).

Given this, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 4.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
