Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  63  81  83  81  64
1  76  92  49  32  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [76 92 49 32 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple optimization method. Here, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. 

From the given table, we have:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 63
- Item 1: 81
- Item 2: 83
- Item 3: 81
- Item 4: 64

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 76
- Item 1: 92
- Item 2: 49
- Item 3: 32
- Item 4: 22

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the total valuation each agent can get. We'll start by assigning the highest value items to each agent:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (92), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (83), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 0 also values item 3 (81) highly, so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 1 values item 0 (76) more than Agent 0, so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
5. Finally, Agent 0 values item 4 (64) more than Agent 1, so assign item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent's total valuation is maximized based on their individual preferences for the items.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1]

Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
