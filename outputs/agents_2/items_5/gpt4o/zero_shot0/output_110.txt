Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  68  63  29  56
1  98  67  33  96  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that considers both agents' valuations and tries to balance their satisfaction.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each item and attempt a fair distribution:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 57
- Item 1: 68
- Item 2: 63
- Item 3: 29
- Item 4: 56

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 98
- Item 1: 67
- Item 2: 33
- Item 3: 96
- Item 4: 22

To start, let's assign items based on where each agent has the highest relative value. Since there are two agents and five items, one agent will receive three items and the other will receive two.

### Allocation Steps:
1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 0 (98) compared to Agent 0 (57).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 3 (96) compared to Agent 0 (29).
3. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (68) compared to Agent 1 (67).
4. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 2 (63) compared to Agent 1 (33).
5. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 4 (56) compared to Agent 1 (22).

Now, to balance the allocation:

- Agent 1 gets Items 0 and 3 (since they have the highest relative value for these).
- Agent 0 gets Items 1, 2, and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
