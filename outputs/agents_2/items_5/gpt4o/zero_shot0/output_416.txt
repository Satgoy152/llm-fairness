Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  74  71  48   9
1  90  58  72  66  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple approach by considering each agent's valuations and aiming to maximize their total valuation.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item is used in the most valuable way possible.

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 90, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 76. So, assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 74, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 58. So, assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 72, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 71. So, assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 48, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 66. So, assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 52, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 9. So, assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the distribution of items:

- Agent 0 has Items: [1]
- Agent 1 has Items: [0, 2, 3, 4]

However, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. We can adjust the allocation to balance the number of items.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 4]

This allocation gives each agent two items, and it is balanced in terms of the number of items while considering their valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
