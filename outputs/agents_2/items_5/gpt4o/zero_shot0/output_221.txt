Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  33  43  82  97
1  61  23  22   4  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their total value, we can use a strategy such as maximizing the total value for each agent or ensuring that both agents get a similar value from the items they receive. In this case, since there are only two agents and five items, we can experiment with different distributions to get a fair allocation.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Agent 0: 62 + 33 + 43 + 82 + 97 = 317
- Agent 1: 61 + 23 + 22 + 4 + 32 = 142

The items can be distributed to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering which items each agent values most. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on the highest value each agent places on an item.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least two items since there are five items.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 3, and 4: Value total = 62 + 82 + 97 = 241
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2: Value total = 23 + 22 = 45

However, this allocation may not seem fair considering Agent 1's total value. Instead, we can try swapping items to make the allocation fairer.

- Swap item 0 (value 62) with item 1 (value 33)
- Swap item 2 (value 43) with item 4 (value 32)

This gives us:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 4: Value total = 82 + 97 = 179
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 1, and 2: Value total = 61 + 23 + 22 = 106

This way, we achieve a more balanced allocation. Hereâ€™s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive at least two items, and the total value is distributed more fairly based on their preferences.
