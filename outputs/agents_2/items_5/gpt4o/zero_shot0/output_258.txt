Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  54  40  74  95
1  73  26   4   0  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value of all items. We can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value that each agent receives. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

   - Agent 0: 55 + 54 + 40 + 74 + 95 = 318
   - Agent 1: 73 + 26 + 4 + 0 + 77 = 180

2. Determine a fair allocation. Since there are 5 items, each agent should get approximately half of the total items, which means 2 or 3 items per agent.

3. One approach is to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is maximized for the least advantaged agent, considering the integer number of items constraint.

By examining different combinations, you can achieve a fair allocation:

- Allocate items 0, 2, and 4 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 a total value of 73 + 4 + 77 = 154.
- Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 a total value of 54 + 74 = 128.

This allocation is fair because it tries to balance the value received by each agent while ensuring each gets an integer number of items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
