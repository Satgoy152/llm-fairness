Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  29  89  49   0  35
1  45  30  21  22  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from the items assigned to them. Here's one way to do this using the valuations given:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 29 + 89 + 49 + 0 + 35 = 202
   - Agent 1: 45 + 30 + 21 + 22 + 11 = 129

2. Allocate items to each agent in a way that attempts to maximize their satisfaction:
   - Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1 (89).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (45).

Continue assigning items by checking the next highest valuations:

- Item 2 is valued at 49 by Agent 0 and 21 by Agent 1. Assign it to Agent 0.
- Item 4 is valued at 35 by Agent 0 and 11 by Agent 1. Assign it to Agent 0.
- Item 3 is valued at 0 by Agent 0 and 22 by Agent 1. Assign it to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, and 4
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 3

This allocation provides a fair distribution based on the values each agent has for the items, maximizing their total valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
