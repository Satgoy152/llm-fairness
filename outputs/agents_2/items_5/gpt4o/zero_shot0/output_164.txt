Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  14  32  41  28
1  56  58  35  26  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would receive for different allocations:

1. **Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 2], Agent 1 gets items [3, 4]:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation = 52 + 14 + 32 = 98
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 26 + 88 = 114

2. **Agent 0 gets items [0, 2, 3], Agent 1 gets items [1, 4]:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation = 52 + 32 + 41 = 125
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 58 + 88 = 146

3. **Agent 0 gets items [0, 3, 4], Agent 1 gets items [1, 2]:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation = 52 + 41 + 28 = 121
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 58 + 35 = 93

4. **Agent 0 gets items [1, 2, 4], Agent 1 gets items [0, 3]:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation = 14 + 32 + 28 = 74
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 56 + 26 = 82

5. **Agent 0 gets items [2, 3, 4], Agent 1 gets items [0, 1]:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation = 32 + 41 + 28 = 101
   - Agent 1's total valuation = 56 + 58 = 114

Among these options, allocation 2 provides a balanced result in terms of overall satisfaction. Therefore, the allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
