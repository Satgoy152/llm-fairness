Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  88  98  32  13
1  48   6  92   9  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's evaluate different allocation strategies for the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 28
- Item 1: 88
- Item 2: 98
- Item 3: 32
- Item 4: 13

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 48
- Item 1: 6
- Item 2: 92
- Item 3: 9
- Item 4: 26

Since there are two agents and five items, each agent should receive at least two items, with one agent receiving an additional item. We'll aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes the valuation for each agent.

Let's evaluate allocations:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [1, 2, 3]
   - Agent 1 gets items [0, 4]

   Total valuation for Agent 0 = 88 + 98 + 32 = 218
   Total valuation for Agent 1 = 48 + 26 = 74

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 2]
   - Agent 1 gets items [3, 4]

   Total valuation for Agent 0 = 28 + 88 + 98 = 214
   Total valuation for Agent 1 = 9 + 26 = 35

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [2, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1 gets items [0, 1]

   Total valuation for Agent 0 = 98 + 32 + 13 = 143
   Total valuation for Agent 1 = 48 + 6 = 54

Allocation 1 provides the maximum total valuation for both agents without one agent getting significantly more value than the other. Therefore, Allocation 1 is the most balanced and fair in terms of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

The optimal allocation in JSON format is:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
