Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  43   2  56  42
1  19  17  91  27  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [65, 43, 2, 56, 42]
- Agent 1: [19, 17, 91, 27, 80]

We need to distribute the items to balance the total value each agent receives. One approach is to consider the highest valuations each agent has for the items and allocate accordingly.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it highly (91).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it highest (65).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, since it maintains a higher total valuation for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 or 1. We choose Agent 0 to balance the number of items allocated.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as they have a higher valuation for this item (80) compared to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]

In JSON format, this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
