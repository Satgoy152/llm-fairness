Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  93  37  91  71
1  96   4   5  17  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we have two agents (0 and 1) and five items (0 to 4). Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate the items:

Agent 0 valuations:
- Item 0: 60
- Item 1: 93
- Item 2: 37
- Item 3: 91
- Item 4: 71

Agent 1 valuations:
- Item 0: 96
- Item 1: 4
- Item 2: 5
- Item 3: 17
- Item 4: 82

Let's maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness:

1. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (96), compared to Agent 0's 60.
2. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (93), compared to Agent 1's 4.
3. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 2 at 37, compared to Agent 1's 5.
4. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 at 91, compared to Agent 1's 17.
5. **Assign Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 4 at 82, compared to Agent 0's 71.

This allocation maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
