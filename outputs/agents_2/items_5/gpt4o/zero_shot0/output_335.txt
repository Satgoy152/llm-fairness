Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  97  76  30  25
1  72  87  64  12  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider a simple approach: allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them, while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items.

1. Agent 0 values: [96, 97, 76, 30, 25]
2. Agent 1 values: [72, 87, 64, 12, 14]

We can start by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a breakdown:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 values it at 72. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 87. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 64. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 values it at 12. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 values it at 14. Allocate to Agent 0.

Since all items are allocated to Agent 0, let's adjust to make the allocation fair by ensuring that Agent 1 gets some items. We need to balance the total valuation between the agents.

Let's consider reallocating some items to Agent 1:

- Reallocate Item 3 to Agent 1
- Reallocate Item 4 to Agent 1

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
