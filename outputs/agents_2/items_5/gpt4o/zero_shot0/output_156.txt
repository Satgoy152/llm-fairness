Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  38  94  87  82
1   4  69  52  34   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's summarize the valuations for clarity:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 38
  - Item 2: 94
  - Item 3: 87
  - Item 4: 82

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 69
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 34
  - Item 4: 7

Since there are 5 items and 2 agents, each agent should receive approximately half the items. Given that the number of items is odd, one agent will receive 3 items and the other will receive 2 items. We will aim for a fair allocation based on the valuations.

### Allocation Strategy

1. Calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation.
2. Choose the allocation that maximizes the overall satisfaction for both agents.

### Allocation Process

Based on the valuations, we can determine a fair allocation by considering items with high valuations for each agent.

- Agent 0 should receive items with their highest valuations.
- Agent 1 should receive items with their highest valuations.

By analyzing the valuations, one possible fair allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 3, and 4. (Valuations: 94, 87, and 82)
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1. (Valuations: 4 and 69)

This allocation results in the following valuations:
- Agent 0 total valuation: 94 + 87 + 82 = 263
- Agent 1 total valuation: 4 + 69 = 73

This allocation considers the higher valuations for each agent and tries to balance the difference in total valuation across both agents.

### Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation is a fair distribution based on the given valuations, where each agent receives a reasonable portion of their highest-valued items.
