Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  75  10  76   7
1  36  16  46   3  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value assigned to each agent, while trying to balance the total value as evenly as possible between them. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent if They Take All Items:**
   - Agent 0: 79 + 75 + 10 + 76 + 7 = 247
   - Agent 1: 36 + 16 + 46 + 3 + 33 = 134

2. **Item-by-Item Comparison:**
   - For each item, compare the value each agent assigns to it and assign it to the agent with the higher value for that item.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 36. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 16. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 values it at 46. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 3. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 7, Agent 1 values it at 33. Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 3
   - Agent 1 receives items: 2, 4

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
