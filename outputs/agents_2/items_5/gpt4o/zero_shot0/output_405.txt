Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  39   9  23  82
1  86  49  48  48  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 49 48 48 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives while giving each agent an integer number of items.

Here is the valuation table for clarity:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  39   9  23  82
1  86  49  48  48  34
```

### Steps to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Analysis:**
   - Agent 0 has high value for item 4.
   - Agent 1 has high value for item 0.

2. **Allocation Approach:**
   - Assign each agent the items where they have significantly higher valuations, to maximize overall satisfaction.

3. **Specific Allocations:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 4 since their valuation (82) is greater than Agent 1's valuation (34).
   - Agent 1 gets item 0 since their valuation (86) is greater than Agent 0's valuation (12).

4. **Remaining Items Analysis:**
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 at 49.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 at 48.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 at 48.

5. **Fair Allocation for Remaining Items:**
   - Assign items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 1 as they have consistently higher valuations for these items.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their higher valuation, thereby achieving a fair distribution of value.
