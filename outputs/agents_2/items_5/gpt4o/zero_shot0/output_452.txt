Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  47  44  59  21
1  64  25  69  76  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure each agent gets items such that the allocation is as balanced as possible according to their valuations. One way to achieve this is by maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [38, 47, 44, 59, 21]
- Agent 1: [64, 25, 69, 76, 17]

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign the highest valued items to agents first:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 76.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the next highest at 69.
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 59 (but it's already taken by Agent 1).

2. Consider the remaining items for Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 next highest at 47.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 next highest at 44 (but it's already taken by Agent 1).
   - Agent 0 values item 0 next highest at 38.

3. Consider the remaining items for Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 next highest at 64.

4. Agent 0 takes item 4, as it is the last item remaining.

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, and as balanced a valuation as possible:

- Agent 0: items [0, 1, 4]
- Agent 1: items [2, 3]

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
