Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  87  18  78  53
1  62  95  42   5  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. List all possible allocations of items to agents.
2. Calculate the total value for each agent in each allocation.
3. Choose the allocation that maximizes the minimum total value among the agents, ensuring fairness.

Let's perform the allocation:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 0    | 79            | 62            |
| 1    | 87            | 95            |
| 2    | 18            | 42            |
| 3    | 78            | 5             |
| 4    | 53            | 16            |

Given the valuations, a fair approach is to allocate items such that both agents get approximately similar total values. An optimal allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 3
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4

Calculating the total values for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0: 79 (Item 0) + 87 (Item 1) + 78 (Item 3) = 244
- Agent 1: 42 (Item 2) + 16 (Item 4) = 58

This allocation is not fair since Agent 0 has a significantly higher total value. Let's try another allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3

Calculating the total values for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0: 79 (Item 0) + 53 (Item 4) = 132
- Agent 1: 95 (Item 1) + 42 (Item 2) + 5 (Item 3) = 142

This allocation provides a more balanced distribution of values between the agents. 

Therefore, the allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
