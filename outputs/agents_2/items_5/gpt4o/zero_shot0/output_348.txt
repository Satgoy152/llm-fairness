Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  36  62  49  86
1  31   6  51  21  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We'll use a greedy approach to assign items based on the agents' valuations. Here's an analysis of the table to allocate items fairly:

### Values:
- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 62
  - Item 3: 49
  - Item 4: 86
- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 51
  - Item 3: 21
  - Item 4: 72

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Start by examining each item and determine which agent values it more.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.
3. Balance the total number of items given to each agent since there are two agents and five items, one agent will receive three items and the other two.

### Allocation Process:
- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values this more (31 vs. 9).
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values this more (36 vs. 6).
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this more (62 vs. 51).
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values this more (49 vs. 21).
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values this more (86 vs. 72).

Given these valuations, allocate items to balance the number of items:
- Assign items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 0 (since they have higher valuation for most items).
- Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 1 (to balance number of items allocated).

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair distribution of items based on their valuations, with Agent 0 receiving three items and Agent 1 receiving two.
