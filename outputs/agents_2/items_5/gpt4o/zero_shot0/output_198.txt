Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  95  5  50  56  88
1  87  8  66  47  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent with respect to their preferences. Here's one way to do that:

1. **Consider the valuations:**

   Agent 0:
   - Item 0: 95
   - Item 1: 5
   - Item 2: 50
   - Item 3: 56
   - Item 4: 88

   Agent 1:
   - Item 0: 87
   - Item 1: 8
   - Item 2: 66
   - Item 3: 47
   - Item 4: 59

2. **Assign items to agents:**

   - Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 4. Assign these items to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values items 2 and 3. Assign these items to Agent 1.
   - Item 1 has low value for both agents, but slightly higher for Agent 0.

3. **Final allocation:**

    - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 4
    - Agent 1: Items 2 and 3

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their preferences and tries to balance the total value each agent receives.
