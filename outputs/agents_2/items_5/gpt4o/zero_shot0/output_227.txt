Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3  4
0  56  48  78  20  8
1  47  22  38  67  7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll also aim to balance the total valuation as evenly as possible between the two agents.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation and determine a fair distribution. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Sorting by Valuation Priority:**
   - For Agent 0: Items sorted by valuation: Item 2 (78), Item 0 (56), Item 1 (48), Item 3 (20), Item 4 (8).
   - For Agent 1: Items sorted by valuation: Item 3 (67), Item 0 (47), Item 2 (38), Item 1 (22), Item 4 (7).

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

3. **Allocate the Items:**
   - Agent 0 gets items they value highly: [0, 1, 2].
   - Agent 1 gets items they value highly: [3, 4].

4. **Calculate Total Valuation:**
   - Agent 0: 56 (Item 0) + 48 (Item 1) + 78 (Item 2) = 182
   - Agent 1: 67 (Item 3) + 7 (Item 4) = 74

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 182 and Agent 1 a total valuation of 74. While not perfectly balanced, this allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and respects their highest preferences based on valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
