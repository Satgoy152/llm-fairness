Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  44  54  39  64
1  37  48  10  94  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to maximize the total satisfaction or value each agent receives. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [16, 44, 54, 39, 64]
- Agent 1's valuations: [37, 48, 10, 94, 23]

We can use the following steps to allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning the items with the highest difference in valuation between the two agents to the agent who values it more.
2. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

### Step-by-Step Allocation

1. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0's valuation: 39
   - Agent 1's valuation: 94
   - Difference: 55 (Agent 1 values more)
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0's valuation: 54
   - Agent 1's valuation: 10
   - Difference: 44 (Agent 0 values more)
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0's valuation: 64
   - Agent 1's valuation: 23
   - Difference: 41 (Agent 0 values more)
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0's valuation: 44
   - Agent 1's valuation: 48
   - Difference: 4 (Agent 1 values more)
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0's valuation: 16
   - Agent 1's valuation: 37
   - Difference: 21 (Agent 1 values more)
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their preferences and maximizes their total satisfaction.
