Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  58  35  32  64
1  42  16  70  20   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate all the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing overall satisfaction or utility. One common approach is to use a method similar to the "adjusted winner" procedure or a simple greedy algorithm to maximize each agent's utility while ensuring a fair distribution of items.

Let's analyze the given valuations and make allocations:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 38
- Item 1: 58
- Item 2: 35
- Item 3: 32
- Item 4: 64

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 42
- Item 1: 16
- Item 2: 70
- Item 3: 20
- Item 4: 0

Now, we can proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 64, while Agent 1 values it at 0. It is optimal to allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 70, the highest individual valuation for any item. It is optimal to allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 58, while Agent 1 values it at 16. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 38, while Agent 1 values it at 42. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 32, while Agent 1 values it at 20. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives us the following distribution:

Agent 0 receives Items: 1, 3, 4  
Agent 1 receives Items: 0, 2  

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 58 + 32 + 64 = 154
- Agent 1's total valuation: 42 + 70 = 112

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
