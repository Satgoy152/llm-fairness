Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  53  95  87  24
1  41  34  84  90  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a reasonable allocation:

1. **Compute Total Valuation**: First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items. This helps in understanding which agent values the items more collectively.

   - Agent 0 Total Valuation: \( 58 + 53 + 95 + 87 + 24 = 317 \)
   - Agent 1 Total Valuation: \( 41 + 34 + 84 + 90 + 25 = 274 \)

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 at 41. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 34. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 84. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 at 90. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 at 25. Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Check and Adjust for Fairness**: Verify if the allocations are fair and adjust if necessary. In this case, each agent gets 2 or 3 items, which seems fair given the valuations.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
