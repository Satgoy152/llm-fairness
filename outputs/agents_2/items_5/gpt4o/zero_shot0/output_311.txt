Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  68  45  21  13  48
1   3  80  59   1   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. 

Let's examine the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 68
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 13
  - Item 4: 48

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 3
  - Item 1: 80
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 1
  - Item 4: 7

To allocate the items, we can use the following approach:
1. For each item, determine which agent values it more and allocate it to that agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (68 vs. 3), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (80 vs. 45), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (59 vs. 21), allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (13 vs. 1), allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (48 vs. 7), allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's write the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0, 3, and 4, while Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is based on maximizing the value each agent receives from their items.
