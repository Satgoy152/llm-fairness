Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  88  52  41  18
1   2  59  56   4   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll use a greedy approach to allocate the items based on the highest relative value for each agent.

Here is the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 52.
   - Agent 1 values it at 2.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 88.
   - Agent 1 values it at 59.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (since 88 is higher than 59).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 52.
   - Agent 1 values it at 56.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (since 56 is higher than 52).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 41.
   - Agent 1 values it at 4.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (since 41 is higher than 4).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 18.
   - Agent 1 values it at 2.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (since 18 is higher than 2).

Based on this allocation, the JSON object representing the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the highest total value they can receive while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
