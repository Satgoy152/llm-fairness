Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  30  30  69   0
1  64  19  37   4  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Total Valuation Calculation**: Calculate the total value each agent has for all items combined.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Try to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Ensure that the total value allocated to each agent is as equal as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: 61 + 30 + 30 + 69 + 0 = 190
- Agent 1: 64 + 19 + 37 + 4 + 68 = 192

Now, let's allocate the items:

**Step 1: Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation**
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 64, and Agent 0 values it at 61. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 30, and Agent 1 values it at 19. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 37, and Agent 0 values it at 30. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 69, and Agent 1 values it at 4. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 68, and Agent 0 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 1.

**Step 2: Check Fairness**
- Agent 0 receives items [1, 3] with total valuation: 30 + 69 = 99
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 2, 4] with total valuation: 64 + 37 + 68 = 169

This allocation is not fair, as Agent 1 gets significantly more value than Agent 0.

**Step 3: Adjust Allocation for Fairness**
Reassess to balance the total valuation:
- Swap item 3 with item 4, as item 3 has high value to Agent 0 and item 4 has high value to Agent 1.
- New Allocation:
  - Agent 0: Items [1, 4] with total valuation: 30 + 0 = 30
  - Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 3] with total valuation: 64 + 37 + 4 = 105

**Step 4: Final Allocation**
Further adjust to ensure both agents receive a fair share:
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it has a close valuation for both agents.
- Allocate item 1 and item 3 to Agent 1 to balance values better.

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4]

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This distribution balances the total valuations more evenly between the agents.
