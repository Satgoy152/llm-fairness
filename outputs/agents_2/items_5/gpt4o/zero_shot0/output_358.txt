Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  22  96  48  42
1  44  18  64  22  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common approach is to use a method such as the "maximum sum of valuations" or "envy-free allocation" if possible. Here, we aim to distribute items in such a way that both agents feel they have received a fair share.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would have if they received each item:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 34
- Item 1: 22
- Item 2: 96
- Item 3: 48
- Item 4: 42

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 44
- Item 1: 18
- Item 2: 64
- Item 3: 22
- Item 4: 92

Now, to fairly allocate the items, we can follow a greedy approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share.

1. Item 2 is most valued by Agent 0 (96 vs. 64).
2. Item 4 is most valued by Agent 1 (92 vs. 42).
3. Item 0 is most valued by Agent 1 (44 vs. 34).
4. Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0 (48 vs. 22).
5. Item 1 is most valued by Agent 0 (22 vs. 18).

The allocation, ensuring both agents get a fair number of items, could be:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 3, and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 0.

This allocation balances the number of items and attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 1],
    "1": [4, 0]
}
```
