Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  44  66  76  96
1  90  42  34  70   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations, we will aim to assign items to maximize the perceived value for each agent.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 60 | 44 | 66 | 76 | 96 |
| 1          | 90 | 42 | 34 | 70 | 5  |

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items for Agent 1 are item 0 (90) and item 3 (70).
   - Allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 0:**
   - Remaining items are 1, 2, 4.
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are item 4 (96), item 2 (66), and item 1 (44).
   - Allocate items 1, 2, and 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that provide them with the highest possible value based on their preferences.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items with valuations [44, 66, 96] for a total value of 206.
Agent 1 receives items with valuations [90, 70] for a total value of 160.

This distribution maximizes the perceived value for each agent under the constraints given.
