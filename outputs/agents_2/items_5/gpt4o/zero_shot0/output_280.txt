Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  87  15  82  85
1   2  13   8   4  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, ideally maximizing the total value each agent receives. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations**:  
   - Item 0: 92  
   - Item 1: 87  
   - Item 2: 15  
   - Item 3: 82  
   - Item 4: 85  

2. **Agent 1 Valuations**:  
   - Item 0: 2  
   - Item 1: 13  
   - Item 2: 8  
   - Item 3: 4  
   - Item 4: 11  

### Allocation Strategy

- Agent 0 has the highest valuations for all items compared to Agent 1. To ensure a fair distribution and maximize total value while giving each agent a fair share based on their valuations, we must allocate the items considering both total valuation and individual preferences.

- Since Agent 0 values all items substantially higher than Agent 1, we can allocate the most preferred items of Agent 1 to them, ensuring that both agents get items they value.

#### Allocation:

- **Agent 0** should receive items that they value significantly, while ensuring that Agent 1 gets a fair allocation.

- **Agent 1** should receive items that they value the most relative to Agent 0's lowest valuation differences.

After examining the valuations, a balanced allocation could be:

- Allocate items 0, 1, and 3 to Agent 0, as these are highly valued by Agent 0.
- Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 1, ensuring that Agent 1 gets items with relatively better valuations from their perspective.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives a higher overall value based on their preferences, while Agent 1 receives items that they value relatively more, ensuring fairness given the disparity in valuations.
