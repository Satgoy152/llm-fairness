Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  93   6  47  90
1  11  66  72  90  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering the valuations, we can follow a method that ensures both agents receive a satisfactory portion of the overall value. We will use the valuations to guide the allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - **Agent 0**: 23 + 93 + 6 + 47 + 90 = 259
   - **Agent 1**: 11 + 66 + 72 + 90 + 56 = 295

2. **Allocate Items**:
   - We aim to allocate items in a way that balances the value each agent receives, considering the total valuation.

3. **Start Allocation**:
   - Assign items based on highest to lowest individual item value preferences, while aiming to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here's the suggested allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 1 (value 93), Item 4 (value 90), and Item 0 (value 23)
  - Total value for Agent 0: 206

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 3 (value 90) and Item 2 (value 72)
  - Total value for Agent 1: 162

This allocation gives both agents a set of items, and while it may not perfectly equalize total valuation, it respects the highest preferences of each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 0],
    "1": [3, 2]
}
```
