Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  97  49  55  84
1  17  94  98  97  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One approach is to use an algorithm such as the "Hungarian algorithm" or "Maximum Bipartite Matching" to determine the optimal allocation. However, given the simplicity of this problem, we can visually inspect and assign the items based on the highest valuations.

Here's a simple way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** prefers:
   - Item 0 (value 90)
   - Item 1 (value 97)
   - Item 4 (value 84)

2. **Agent 1** prefers:
   - Item 2 (value 98)
   - Item 3 (value 97)

Based on these preferences, let's allocate the items:

- Assign Item 0, Item 1, and Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 and Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
