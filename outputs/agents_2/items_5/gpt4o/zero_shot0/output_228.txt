Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  86  96   7  53
1  25  62  48  23  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the Items and Their Values for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: [49, 86, 96, 7, 53]
   - Agent 1: [25, 62, 48, 23, 18]

2. **Evaluate Which Items Are Most Valuable to Each Agent:**
   - For Agent 0, the items ranked by value are: 2 (96), 1 (86), 4 (53), 0 (49), 3 (7).
   - For Agent 1, the items ranked by value are: 1 (62), 2 (48), 0 (25), 3 (23), 4 (18).

3. **Allocate Items Based on Maximum Value:**
   - Item 2 is most valuable to Agent 0. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 is most valuable to Agent 0 as well. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Items 3 and 4 hold higher relative value for Agent 1 compared to Agent 0. Assign Items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.
   - The remaining Item 0 is more valuable to Agent 0. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives Items 0, 1, and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives Items 3 and 4.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
