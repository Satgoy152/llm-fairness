Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  2  23  60  32  67
1  2  56  25  22  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items such that both agents are satisfied according to their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [2, 23, 60, 32, 67]
- Agent 1's valuations: [2, 56, 25, 22, 82]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a greedy approach, where we allocate items by trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Value for Agent 0: 2
   - Value for Agent 1: 2
   - We can allocate it to Agent 0 as both have the same valuation.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Value for Agent 0: 23
   - Value for Agent 1: 56
   - Allocate to Agent 1 as they value it higher.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Value for Agent 0: 60
   - Value for Agent 1: 25
   - Allocate to Agent 0 as they value it higher.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Value for Agent 0: 32
   - Value for Agent 1: 22
   - Allocate to Agent 0 as they value it higher.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Value for Agent 0: 67
   - Value for Agent 1: 82
   - Allocate to Agent 1 as they value it higher.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 should receive items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 should receive items 1 and 4.

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
