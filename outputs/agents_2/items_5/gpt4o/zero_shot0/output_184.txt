Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  66  41  91  94
1  70   9  86  24  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a "greedy" strategy, which iteratively assigns the item to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the allocation to ensure fairness.

Here's a step-by-step allocation for the given valuation table:

1. List all items and their valuations by both agents.
2. Iterate over the items and assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure fairness by balancing the number of items each agent receives.

Let's perform the allocation:

| Item | Agent 0 Valuation | Agent 1 Valuation |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 0    | 11                | 70                |
| 1    | 66                | 9                 |
| 2    | 41                | 86                |
| 3    | 91                | 24                |
| 4    | 94                | 92                |

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 1 (70 > 11)
- Item 1: Assign to Agent 0 (66 > 9)
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 1 (86 > 41)
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 0 (91 > 24)
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 0 (94 > 92)

After this allocation, Agent 0 has items 1, 3, and 4, while Agent 1 has items 0 and 2. This gives Agent 0 three items and Agent 1 two items, which is a fair integer allocation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
