Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  39  22  63  74
1  11  71  43   6  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the valuations provided and ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total value while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a simple approach by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Here are the steps to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would receive for all items.
2. Attempt to allocate items by giving priority to the agent who values each item the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

Agent 0's valuations: [61, 39, 22, 63, 74]
Agent 1's valuations: [11, 71, 43, 6, 10]

Item-by-item comparison:
- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 11. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 values it at 71. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 43. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 values it at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 values it at 10. Allocate to Agent 0.

Allocation summary:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 3, 4
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 2

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items with values they consider relatively high, while also distributing all items.
