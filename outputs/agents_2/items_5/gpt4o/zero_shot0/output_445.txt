Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  8  18  65  25  22
1  6   6  93  65   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 6  6 93 65  4]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can evaluate the valuations and attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. 

The matrix of valuations is:

```
   0   1   2   3   4
0  8  18  65  25  22
1  6   6  93  65   4
```

Let's proceed by evaluating the best allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively higher valuations for items 0, 1, and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has a significantly higher valuation for item 2 and also values item 3 highly.

To maximize the satisfaction based on the given valuations, a potential fair allocation could be:

- Give **Agent 0** items 0, 1, and 4.
- Give **Agent 1** items 2 and 3.

This allocation results in:
- **Agent 0**'s total value: 8 (item 0) + 18 (item 1) + 22 (item 4) = 48
- **Agent 1**'s total value: 93 (item 2) + 65 (item 3) = 158

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and maximizes their individual valuations based on the given data. Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
