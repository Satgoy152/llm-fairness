Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  53  69  21  44
1  93  58  43  18  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's consider the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 4 + 53 + 69 + 21 + 44 = 191
- Agent 1's total valuation: 93 + 58 + 43 + 18 + 59 = 271

To ensure fairness, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent's share of the total valuation is as equal as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values this item highly (93) compared to Agent 0 (4), so allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 also values this item more (58 vs 53), but the difference is smaller; consider this for Agent 0 to balance out.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values this item highly (69), so allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values this item more (21 vs 18); allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values this item more (59 vs 44); allocate to Agent 1.

Based on these considerations, we can finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
