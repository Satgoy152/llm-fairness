Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  23  54  77  17
1  30  24   8  84  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm: assign each item to the agent who values it the most. We'll go through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

Here's the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 59.
   - Agent 1 values it at 30.  
   Agent 0 gets item 0.

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 23.
   - Agent 1 values it at 24.  
   Agent 1 gets item 1.

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 54.
   - Agent 1 values it at 8.  
   Agent 0 gets item 2.

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 77.
   - Agent 1 values it at 84.  
   Agent 1 gets item 3.

5. **Item 4**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 17.
   - Agent 1 values it at 31.  
   Agent 1 gets item 4.

Now, let's present the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has an integer number of items, and the allocation is based on maximizing the agents' valuations for the items they receive.
