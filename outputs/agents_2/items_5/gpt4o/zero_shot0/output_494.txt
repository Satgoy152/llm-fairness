Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  17  79  56  61
1  22  17   9  67  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are two agents and five items, one agent will get two items and the other will get three.

Let's evaluate a potential allocation:

1. Start by calculating the total valuation each agent would have for different allocations.
2. Aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 79
  - Item 3: 56
  - Item 4: 61

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 22
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 67
  - Item 4: 97

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 should get items with high value according to their preferences. Items 2, 4, and 3 have the highest values for Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 should get items with high value according to their preferences. Items 4 and 3 have the highest values for Agent 1.

To balance the allocations:
- Allocate items [2, 0, 1] to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0: 79 + 43 + 17 = 139.
- Allocate items [3, 4] to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1: 67 + 97 = 164.

This allocation provides a reasonable balance based on the given valuations, considering the constraints of integer numbers of items. Therefore, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
