Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  98  26  23  29
1  55  81  80  65  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items in this scenario:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 75, and agent 1 values it at 55. Allocate to agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 98, and agent 1 values it at 81. Allocate to agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 26, and agent 1 values it at 80. Allocate to agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 23, and agent 1 values it at 65. Allocate to agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 29, and agent 1 values it at 60. Allocate to agent 1.

Based on this allocation approach, the resulting distribution of items is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with each item going to the agent who values it more.
