Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  12  71  81  57
1  50   3  68  99  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing the total valuations, we can use an approach similar to the "maximum sum of valuations" or "envy-free" allocation. Since we have two agents and five items, each agent will get 2 or 3 items.

Here is the step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item by each agent.
2. Attempt to allocate the items such that the total valuation is maximized for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with this approach:

### Step 1: Calculate valuation differences
- Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents:

| Item | Agent 0 Valuation | Agent 1 Valuation | Difference (0 - 1) |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 0    | 81                | 50                | 31                 |
| 1    | 12                | 3                 | 9                  |
| 2    | 71                | 68                | 3                  |
| 3    | 81                | 99                | -18                |
| 4    | 57                | 17                | 40                 |

### Step 2: Sort items by absolute difference
- Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations to prioritize items with higher valuation differences:

  - Item 4: 40
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 3: 18
  - Item 1: 9
  - Item 2: 3

### Step 3: Allocate items
- Start assigning items based on the sorted order, ensuring that the allocation is fair and each agent gets an integer number of items.

#### Allocation:

- Assign items with the highest positive differences to Agent 0 first and items with negative differences to Agent 1, while maintaining the balance of items.

1. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (higher valuation by 40).
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (higher valuation by 31).
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (higher valuation for Agent 1 by 18).
4. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (higher valuation by 9).
5. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (slightly higher valuation by 3 for Agent 0, but balances the allocation to 3 items for Agent 0 and 2 for Agent 1).

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 4, while Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3. This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent given the constraints.
