Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69   6  16  67  16
1  12  25   7  12  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can look at the valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction for each agent. One way to approach this is to assign the items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning the item with the highest valuation for each agent.
2. Continue assigning the remaining items based on the next highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Based on the valuations given, we can proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuations for items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 has higher valuations for items 1, 2, and 4.

Now, let's assign the items:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3 (valuations 69 and 67 for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, and 4 (valuations 25, 7, and 38 for agent 1)

This allocation ensures both agents get an integer number of items, with agent 0 receiving 2 items and agent 1 receiving 3 items.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
