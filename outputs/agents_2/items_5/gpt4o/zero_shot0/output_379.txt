Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  16  40  88  67
1  78  56  78  68  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to achieve a fair distribution. Here are the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 32 + 16 + 40 + 88 + 67 = 243
- Agent 1's total valuation: 78 + 56 + 78 + 68 + 52 = 332

One way to fairly distribute the items is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each receives an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Allocate item 0 to agent 1 (agent 1 values it more: 78 vs. 32)
- Allocate item 1 to agent 1 (agent 1 values it more: 56 vs. 16)
- Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (agent 1 values it more: 78 vs. 40)
- Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (agent 0 values it more: 88 vs. 68)
- Allocate item 4 to agent 0 (agent 0 values it more: 67 vs. 52)

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 2]

In JSON format, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
