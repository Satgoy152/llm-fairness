Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  7  65  12  24  53
1  1  25  13  41  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the satisfaction of both agents, often referred to as maximizing the total utility. The goal is to allocate items in a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's review the valuations:
- Agent 0: [7, 65, 12, 24, 53]
- Agent 1: [1, 25, 13, 41, 24]

To achieve fairness, we'll allocate items by considering which agent values each item more. We'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most. If there is a tie, we can consider the remaining preferences or allocate randomly.

Here's how the allocation could be done:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 7, while Agent 1 values it at 1. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 65, while Agent 1 values it at 25. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 12, while Agent 1 values it at 13. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 24, while Agent 1 values it at 41. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 53, while Agent 1 values it at 24. Allocate to Agent 0.

Based on these allocations, the agents would receive the following items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, maximizing the overall satisfaction of both agents.
