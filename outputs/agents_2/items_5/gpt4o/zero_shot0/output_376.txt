Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  19  2  57  84  27
1  13  3  46   0  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. One way to approach this is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 57
  - Item 3: 84
  - Item 4: 27

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 13
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 46
  - Item 3: 0
  - Item 4: 65

We can try to assign items to maximize the perceived value for each agent. Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it the highest at 84, while Agent 1 values it at 0).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it higher at 65, compared to Agent 0's 27).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 46).
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it at 19, while Agent 1 values it at 13).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it at 3, while Agent 0 values it at 2).

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the total perceived value for each agent based on their individual valuations.
