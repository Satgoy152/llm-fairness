Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  68  47  59  98
1  36  73  49  97  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to use techniques like the "envy-free" or "max-min" fair allocation methods, which aim to maximize fairness based on the agents' valuations.

Here, we can use the "max-min" approach, which seeks to allocate items such that the minimum value obtained by any agent is maximized. This involves considering different allocation strategies to ensure that each agent gets a fair share.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 92
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 59
  - Item 4: 98

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 49
  - Item 3: 97
  - Item 4: 97

One potential fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 4.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 values: 92 + 68 + 47 = 207
- Agent 1 values: 97 + 97 = 194

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items such that their total valuation is relatively balanced, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
