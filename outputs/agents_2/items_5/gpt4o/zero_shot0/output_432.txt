Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71   7  29   4  46
1   6  96  20  63  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. One simple approach to achieve this is to assign items based on which agent values them more, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Compare the valuations of each item for both agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.

Let's go through the items one by one:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 71, and Agent 1 values it at 6. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 7, and Agent 1 values it at 96. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 29, and Agent 1 values it at 20. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 4, and Agent 1 values it at 63. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 46, and Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
