Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  31   4  26  49
1  96  84  76  91  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free Allocation" or the "Maximum Nash Welfare" method, but given the simplicity of this problem with only two agents, we can use a simpler approach by considering the total value each agent places on the items.

First, let's list the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [87, 31, 4, 26, 49]
- Agent 1's valuations: [96, 84, 76, 91, 36]

Now, let's allocate items to maximize the agents' total valuations:

1. Item 0: Valuation by Agent 0 is 87, and by Agent 1 is 96. Item 0 should be allocated to Agent 1 for higher value.
2. Item 1: Valuation by Agent 0 is 31, and by Agent 1 is 84. Item 1 should be allocated to Agent 1 for higher value.
3. Item 2: Valuation by Agent 0 is 4, and by Agent 1 is 76. Item 2 should be allocated to Agent 1 for higher value.
4. Item 3: Valuation by Agent 0 is 26, and by Agent 1 is 91. Item 3 should be allocated to Agent 1 for higher value.
5. Item 4: Valuation by Agent 0 is 49, and by Agent 1 is 36. Item 4 should be allocated to Agent 0 for higher value.

However, this allocation results in Agent 0 receiving fewer items. We need to balance the allocation by ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's try redistributing the items to ensure fairness:

- Allocate items 0, 1, and 3 to Agent 1, since they have higher values for these items.
- Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 0, which are relatively lower in value for Agent 1.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items and considers the relative valuations.
