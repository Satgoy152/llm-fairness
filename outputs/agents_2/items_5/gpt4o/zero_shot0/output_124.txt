Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  68  85  58  85
1  91  92  92  56  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One potential approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items to the agents who value them the most.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 85
  - Item 3: 58
  - Item 4: 85

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 92
  - Item 3: 56
  - Item 4: 86

By comparing these valuations, we can allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (91 vs. 33).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (92 vs. 68).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (92 vs. 85).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (58 vs. 56).
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (86 vs. 85).

Now, let's assign the items to each agent:

- Agent 1 should receive items 0, 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 0 should receive item 3.

To ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, we can adjust by giving Agent 0 one of the items where the valuations are close. In this case, item 4 has a close valuation between the two agents (85 vs. 86), so we will give it to Agent 0.

Here is an allocation that satisfies these conditions:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
