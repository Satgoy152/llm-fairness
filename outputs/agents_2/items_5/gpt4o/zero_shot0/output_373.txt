Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  92  9  16  72   7
1  14  3  84  93  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 at 92, and Agent 1 values it at 14. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 at 9, and Agent 1 values it at 3. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 at 16, and Agent 1 values it at 84. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 at 72, and Agent 1 values it at 93. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 at 7, and Agent 1 values it at 87. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

The allocation aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent by assigning each item to the agent who values it more. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
