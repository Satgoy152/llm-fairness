Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  39  79  15  22
1  96  85  19  93  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method called "maximum sum allocation." This method involves assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. List all items and their values for each agent.
2. Assign items to agents based on who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 96, while Agent 0 values it at 20. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 85, while Agent 0 values it at 39. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 79, while Agent 1 values it at 19. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 93, while Agent 0 values it at 15. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 53, while Agent 0 values it at 22. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's allocate the items:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives item 2, which they value the most, and Agent 1 receives the remaining items, which they value more highly overall.
