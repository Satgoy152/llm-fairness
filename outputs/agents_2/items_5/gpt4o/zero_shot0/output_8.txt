Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  11  32  46  12
1  95  11  78  35  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we have two agents and five items. Let's proceed with a fair allocation strategy:

### Valuations Matrix
```
Agent \ Item:   0   1   2   3   4
Agent 0:       11  11  32  46  12
Agent 1:       95  11  78  35  19
```

### Total Valuation per Item for Each Agent
- For Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 values it at 95.
- For Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 values it at 11.
- For Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 values it at 78.
- For Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 46, Agent 1 values it at 35.
- For Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 values it at 19.

### Allocation Strategy
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If there's a tie or a strategic consideration, try to balance the number of items assigned to each agent.

### Allocation Process
- Item 0: Assign to Agent 1 (95 > 11)
- Item 1: Tie (11 == 11), assign to Agent 0 to balance the number of items
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 1 (78 > 32)
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 0 (46 > 35)
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 1 (19 > 12)

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 2, 4

### JSON Format Output
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations.
