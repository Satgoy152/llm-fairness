Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  52  92  34  44  76
1  95  89  76  47  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a method that considers the highest valuations first, assigning items to the agent who values them the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 52, 92, 34, 44, 76
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 95, 89, 76, 47, 13

We can follow a greedy strategy by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, provided that each agent ends up with a reasonable number of items.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 95, Agent 0 values it at 52. Assign to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 89. Assign to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 76, Agent 0 values it at 34. Assign to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 47, Agent 0 values it at 44. Assign to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 13. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 3.

Both agents receive an integer number of items. Here's the allocation presented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
