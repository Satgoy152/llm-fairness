Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  58   6  47  87
1  91   3  93   4  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, provided that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the values:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 values it at 91.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 3.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 values it at 93.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 values it at 4.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 65.

For fair allocation, we try to balance the number of items while maximizing the value for each agent:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it more:
   - Item 0: Assign to Agent 1 (value 91 vs. 6)
   - Item 1: Assign to Agent 0 (value 58 vs. 3)
   - Item 2: Assign to Agent 1 (value 93 vs. 6)
   - Item 3: Assign to Agent 0 (value 47 vs. 4)
   - Item 4: Assign to Agent 0 (value 87 vs. 65)

2. Check the allocation:
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4 (values: 58, 47, 87)
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 2 (values: 91, 93)

3. Both agents receive an integer number of items (Agent 0 gets 3 items, Agent 1 gets 2 items).

Given the allocations, we can present them in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
