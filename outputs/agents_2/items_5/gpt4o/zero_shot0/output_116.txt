Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  96  44  66  30
1   4  61  87  73  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 61 87 73 50]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. Let's calculate the sum of valuations for several potential allocations to find a fair distribution.

### Valuations Table
- **Agent 0**: [91, 96, 44, 66, 30]
- **Agent 1**: [4, 61, 87, 73, 50]

### Steps to Allocate
1. **Sort by preference**: We'll consider each agent's highest valued items.
2. **Allocate items**: Try to distribute items to ensure a fairly equal total valuation.

### Allocation
- **Agent 0's Preferences** (in order of preference): Item 1 (96), Item 0 (91), Item 3 (66), Item 2 (44), Item 4 (30)
- **Agent 1's Preferences** (in order of preference): Item 2 (87), Item 3 (73), Item 1 (61), Item 4 (50), Item 0 (4)

Distributing based on preference and maximizing total valuation:

- Allocate **Items 0 and 1** to **Agent 0**: 
  - Total valuation for Agent 0 = 91 (Item 0) + 96 (Item 1) = 187
- Allocate **Items 2, 3, and 4** to **Agent 1**: 
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 = 87 (Item 2) + 73 (Item 3) + 50 (Item 4) = 210

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their respective valuations given the constraints.
