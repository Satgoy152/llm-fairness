Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  22  96  39   8
1   9  89  71  38  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One way to achieve this is by using a greedy approach focused on allocating items based on the highest relative valuation difference between the agents.

Let's calculate the difference in valuations for each item and assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 9.
   - Difference: 76 - 9 = 67. Assign to Agent 0.

2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 at 89.
   - Difference: 89 - 22 = 67. Assign to Agent 1.

3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 at 71.
   - Difference: 96 - 71 = 25. Assign to Agent 0.

4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 at 38.
   - Difference: 39 - 38 = 1. Assign to Agent 0.

5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 at 20.
   - Difference: 20 - 8 = 12. Assign to Agent 1.

Given this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3, while Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4. This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent with consideration of their preferences.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
