Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  20  80  11  49
1  74  39  44  32  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [74 39 44 32 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [73, 20, 80, 11, 49]
- Agent 1: [74, 39, 44, 32, 74]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can try to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 at 80, which is their highest value for any item, while Agent 1 values it at 44. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 at 74, which is tied for their highest value, while Agent 0 values it at 73. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 4**: Both agents value item 4 equally at 74 and 49 respectively, but since Agent 1 values it at 74, which is tied for their highest value, assign item 4 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 at 20, and Agent 1 values it at 39. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 as it gives them a higher value.

5. **Item 3**: This is the last item. Agent 0 values item 3 at 11, while Agent 1 values it at 32. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 for a better balance.

### Final Allocations:

After considering the above steps, here is a fair allocation that maximizes the total value received by each agent:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and it aims to balance the total valuations each agent receives.
