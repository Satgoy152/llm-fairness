Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88   7  80  64  78
1  72  91  19  23  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that the distribution is as equitable as possible. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0** seems to value item 0 the most, followed by item 2, item 4, item 3, and then item 1. 
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most, followed by item 4, item 0, item 3, and then item 2.

With these preferences, we can distribute the items to maximize overall satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0, 2, and 3.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1 and 4.

This allocation gives:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 (88), 2 (80), and 3 (64). Total value = 232.
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 (91) and 4 (86). Total value = 177.

Both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
