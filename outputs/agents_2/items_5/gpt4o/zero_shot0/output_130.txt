Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  33  18  58  10
1  48  37  54  66  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Best Allocation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 values it at 48. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 33, Agent 1 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 values it at 54. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 66. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 values it at 93. Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Review the Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets items 1, 2, 3, and 4.

3. **Ensure Fair Distribution:**
   - Agent 0: Total valuation = 74.
   - Agent 1: Total valuation = 37 + 54 + 66 + 93 = 250.

Considering the above steps, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
