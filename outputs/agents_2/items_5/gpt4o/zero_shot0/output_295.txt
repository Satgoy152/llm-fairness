Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  15  99  78  11
1  99  55  83  12  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We can achieve this by considering the highest valuations for each item and assigning accordingly, while also trying to balance the total valuation received by each agent. 

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [97, 15, 99, 78, 11]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [99, 55, 83, 12, 36]

We need to assign 5 items in total.

### Assigning Items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 97
   - Agent 1 values it at 99
   - Assign to Agent 1 (better valuation)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 15
   - Agent 1 values it at 55
   - Assign to Agent 1 (better valuation)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 99
   - Agent 1 values it at 83
   - Assign to Agent 0 (better valuation)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 78
   - Agent 1 values it at 12
   - Assign to Agent 0 (better valuation)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 11
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Assign to Agent 1 (better valuation)

After reviewing the allocations and ensuring fairness, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items.
