Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  34  18  62  34
1  99  46   1  33  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share. We can use a simple algorithm to allocate the items based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **List the items and their valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0's valuations: [12, 34, 18, 62, 34]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [99, 46, 1, 33, 71]

2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item:**

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 99, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 12. Allocate it to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 46, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 34. Allocate it to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 18, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 1. Allocate it to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 62, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 33. Allocate it to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 71, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 34. Allocate it to Agent 1.

3. **Assign the items based on the allocation:**

   - Agent 0 receives items: [2, 3]
   - Agent 1 receives items: [0, 1, 4]

By following this allocation, each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the given JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
