Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  34  96  77  21
1  58  34  78  41  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 34 78 41 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. This is often referred to as the "maximum sum" problem in fair division.

Let's consider the valuations:

Agent 0: [56, 34, 96, 77, 21]  
Agent 1: [58, 34, 78, 41, 33]  

We will aim to allocate items to maximize the total value each agent receives.

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (58 vs 56), so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Both agents value it equally (34 each), so it can be allocated to either. Let's allocate it to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (96 vs 78), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (77 vs 41), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (33 vs 21), so allocate to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
