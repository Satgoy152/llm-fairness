Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  80  26  67  99
1  38  56  88  33  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Given the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  80  26  67  99
1  38  56  88  33  99
```

One approach is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 4.

After evaluating the valuations, we can allocate the items as:

- Agent 0: [1, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 4]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation gives agent 0 items with a total valuation of 147 (80 + 67), and agent 1 items with a total valuation of 225 (38 + 88 + 99). This approach provides a fair distribution based on their preferences.
