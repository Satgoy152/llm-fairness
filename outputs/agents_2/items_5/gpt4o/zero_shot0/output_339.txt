Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  74  17  84  53
1  97  60  84  12  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the "maximum weighted matching" approach. This means we try to allocate items to agents such that the total valuation is maximized. The objective is to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 0
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 84
  - Item 4: 53

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 12
  - Item 4: 97

By examining these valuations, we want to maximize the total value for both agents. Let's try to allocate items based on the highest potential value for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated to one agent only.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 97 (higher than Agent 0's 0).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 74 (higher than Agent 1's 60).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 84 (higher than Agent 0's 17).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 84 (higher than Agent 1's 12).
5. **Item 4**: Both agents value it equally at 97. To maintain balance, it can be assigned to Agent 1 as they have fewer high-value items assigned (considering Agent 0 already has high-value items).

Based on these observations, a fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 3
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 2, 4

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, maintaining fairness and maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
