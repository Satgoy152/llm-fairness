Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  51  88  37  29
1  51   0  60  40  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. This often involves considering the preferences of each agent and attempting to balance the total value they receive.

Let's evaluate the current scenario:

- Agent 0's valuations: [7, 51, 88, 37, 29]
- Agent 1's valuations: [51, 0, 60, 40, 81]

To ensure a fair distribution, we can employ a method such as the "divide and choose" strategy or attempt to balance the overall valuation each agent receives.

After reviewing the valuations, here's a possible fair allocation:

1. Allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while balancing the value difference between them. 

A good way to proceed is to allocate items based on their highest value for each agent but also ensuring that the total value is distributed fairly across both.

After examining the values and making decisions based on maximizing fairness, we can propose the following allocation:

Agent 0:
- Item 2 (88)
- Item 3 (37)

Agent 1:
- Item 0 (51)
- Item 4 (81)
- Item 1 (0)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 a total value of 88 + 37 = 125
- Agent 1 a total value of 51 + 81 + 0 = 132

This allocation is reasonably balanced given the constraints. Now, we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their respective valuations.
