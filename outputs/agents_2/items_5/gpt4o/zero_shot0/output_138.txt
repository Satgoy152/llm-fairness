Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  44  83  35  38
1  87  31  18  78  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the method of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Items and Valuations:**

   The items are numbered 0 to 4, and the valuations for each agent are:
   - Agent 0: [8, 44, 83, 35, 38]
   - Agent 1: [87, 31, 18, 78, 19]

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuations:**

   We will allocate items to the agent who values them the most to maximize overall satisfaction.

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 87, higher than Agent 0's 8.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 44, higher than Agent 1's 31.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 83, higher than Agent 1's 18.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 78, higher than Agent 0's 35.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 38, higher than Agent 1's 19.

3. **Allocate Items to Each Agent:**

   Based on the above distribution, the allocation will be:

   - Agent 0: Items 1, 2, and 4
   - Agent 1: Items 0 and 3

4. **Present the Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most, thereby maximizing their individual satisfaction.
