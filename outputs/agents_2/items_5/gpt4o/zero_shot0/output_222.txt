Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  35  29  73  70  16
1  52  50  75   5  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can attempt to assign items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 35
   - Item 1: 29
   - Item 2: 73
   - Item 3: 70
   - Item 4: 16

2. **Agent 1 Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 52
   - Item 1: 50
   - Item 2: 75
   - Item 3: 5
   - Item 4: 84

### Allocation Strategy

- **Step 1:** Identify the most valued items for each agent:
  - Agent 0 highly values Item 2 (73) and Item 3 (70).
  - Agent 1 highly values Item 4 (84) and Item 2 (75).

- **Step 2:** Allocate items based on maximizing value for each agent while ensuring fairness:
  - Since both agents highly value Item 2, we need to decide who gets it. Agent 1 values it more, so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
  - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valued item.
  - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 as itâ€™s highly valued and not as highly valued by Agent 1.

- **Step 3:** Allocate remaining items:
  - Allocate Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 has already received two high-value items.

### Final Allocation

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a way that maximizes their total perceived value based on their preferences.
