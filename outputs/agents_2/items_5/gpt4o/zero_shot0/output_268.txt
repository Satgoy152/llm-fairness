Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  57  49  31  18
1  61  51  87  71  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a potential allocation:

Agent 0 valuations: 9, 57, 49, 31, 18  
Agent 1 valuations: 61, 51, 87, 71, 15

We will try to allocate items in such a way that both agents have a fair allocation in terms of total value.

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 87.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 57.

3. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**:
   - The next highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 3 at 71.

4. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**:
   - After allocating item 3, we can give item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0 (61 vs. 9).

5. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0**:
   - Finally, allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it balances the allocation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 1 and 4, while Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 3. This ensures a fair distribution based on their valuations.
