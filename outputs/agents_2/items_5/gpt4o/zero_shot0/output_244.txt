Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  77  21  58  89
1   7  88  52  68  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One possible approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most until each agent has a roughly equal total valuation.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each item:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 44
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 58
  - Item 4: 89
  - Total if all items were given to Agent 0 = 44 + 77 + 21 + 58 + 89 = 289

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 68
  - Item 4: 74
  - Total if all items were given to Agent 1 = 7 + 88 + 52 + 68 + 74 = 289

Since both agents have the same total valuation of 289 for all items, one way to distribute the items fairly is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each receives an approximately equal number of items.

We can allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If there is a tie in the valuation, consider balancing the count of items allocated.

Let's assign the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 44 and Agent 1 values it at 7. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 77 and Agent 1 values it at 88. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 21 and Agent 1 values it at 52. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 58 and Agent 1 values it at 68. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 89 and Agent 1 values it at 74. Assign to Agent 0.

With the items assigned like this, we ensure a fair distribution based on maximum valuations while keeping the number of items allocated to each agent close to equal.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
