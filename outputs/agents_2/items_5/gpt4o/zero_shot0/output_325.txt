Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  35  65  50  78
1   9  64  97  34  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives. This can be approached as an assignment problem or by finding a balanced allocation.

Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [20, 35, 65, 50, 78]
   - Total value: 248

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [9, 64, 97, 34, 35]
   - Total value: 239

To ensure fairness, we can try to allocate items such that each agent's total valuation is balanced as much as possible. We will attempt to allocate items by considering each agent's preference for items with higher values to them.

**Step-by-step allocation**:

- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it most (97), while Agent 0 values it at 65. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 78, while Agent 1 values it at 35. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 50, while Agent 1 values it at 34. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 64, while Agent 0 values it at 35. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 20, while Agent 1 values it at 9. Allocate to Agent 0.

**Final Allocation**:
- Agent 0: [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
