Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  59  12   2  55
1   0  75  85  92  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations of the items by each agent. A common approach is to use the "envy-free" or "maximize the total valuation" method, where we aim for each agent to get the items that give them the highest total valuation.

Let's analyze the valuations for the agents:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 50, 59, 12, 2, 55
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: 0, 75, 85, 92, 37

One approach to ensure a fair allocation is to maximize the sum of the valuations for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated to one agent.

We can proceed with a simple greedy algorithm:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as it has a high valuation (92) and agent 0 values it very low (2).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as it has a high valuation (85) and agent 0 values it low (12).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as it has a higher valuation (75) than agent 0 (59).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as it has a higher valuation (55) than agent 1 (37).
5. Finally, assign item 0 to agent 0, as agent 1 values it at 0.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations.
