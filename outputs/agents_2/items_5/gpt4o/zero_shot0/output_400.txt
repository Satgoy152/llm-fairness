Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27   4  12  15  88
1  36  10  55  95  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations for both agents:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 27
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 15
  - Item 4: 88

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 55
  - Item 3: 95
  - Item 4: 24

To begin, let's identify the highest valuations for each item and try to allocate items to the agents based on their preferences:

1. Item 3 has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (95). Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
2. Item 4 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (88). Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
3. Item 2 has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (55). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Item 0 has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (36). Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
5. Item 1 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (4). Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 Items: 4, 1
- Agent 1 Items: 3, 2, 0

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their total valuation based on their preferences.

The allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3, 2, 0]
}
```
