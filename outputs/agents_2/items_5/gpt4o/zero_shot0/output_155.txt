Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  42  31  18  48
1  32  55  10  28  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation difference between the two agents for each item.

Here's how we can do it step by step:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations in descending order.
3. Allocate items to the agent who values it more, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's perform these steps with the given data:

### Valuation Differences
- Item 0: Agent 1 has higher valuation than Agent 0 (32 vs. 14) -> Difference: 18
- Item 1: Agent 1 has higher valuation than Agent 0 (55 vs. 42) -> Difference: 13
- Item 2: Agent 0 has higher valuation than Agent 1 (31 vs. 10) -> Difference: 21
- Item 3: Agent 1 has higher valuation than Agent 0 (28 vs. 18) -> Difference: 10
- Item 4: Agent 0 has higher valuation than Agent 1 (48 vs. 36) -> Difference: 12

### Sorted Items by Valuation Difference
1. Item 2 (21) - Agent 0 values more
2. Item 0 (18) - Agent 1 values more
3. Item 1 (13) - Agent 1 values more
4. Item 4 (12) - Agent 0 values more
5. Item 3 (10) - Agent 1 values more

### Allocation
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (higher valuation by Agent 0)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive integers of items and that the total valuation for each agent is reasonably balanced given their preferences.
