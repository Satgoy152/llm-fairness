Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  36  73  44  90
1  76  72  72  14  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple method considering each agent's preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List all items with their valuations for both agents:**

   - Agent 0: [81, 36, 73, 44, 90]
   - Agent 1: [76, 72, 72, 14, 85]

2. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent:**

   - Total for Agent 0: 81 + 36 + 73 + 44 + 90 = 324
   - Total for Agent 1: 76 + 72 + 72 + 14 + 85 = 319

3. **Sort the items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.**

   | Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) |
   |------|---------|---------|--------------------------------|
   | 0    | 81      | 76      | 5                              |
   | 1    | 36      | 72      | -36                            |
   | 2    | 73      | 72      | 1                              |
   | 3    | 44      | 14      | 30                             |
   | 4    | 90      | 85      | 5                              |

4. **Allocate items based on these differences to balance the total valuation:**

   - Agent 0 has a slightly higher total valuation, so we will try to allocate items to Agent 1 that Agent 0 values less.
   - Allocate items to maximize the total valuation for each agent while keeping allocations integer:

   - Agent 0: [0, 2, 3]
   - Agent 1: [1, 4]

5. **Check valuations for each agent with this allocation:**

   - Valuation for Agent 0: 81 + 73 + 44 = 198
   - Valuation for Agent 1: 72 + 85 = 157

The allocation reflects a fair distribution considering both agents' valuations and the constraint that each gets an integer number of items.
