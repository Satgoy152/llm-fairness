Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  42  50   7  62
1  82  97  45  97  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items they are allocated, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will proceed with the allocation process by considering each agent's preferences for the items.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 76 + 42 + 50 + 7 + 62 = 237
- Agent 1's total valuation: 82 + 97 + 45 + 97 + 89 = 410

Next, we will allocate the items to balance the value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (97) and item 3 (97). Allocating these two items to Agent 1 will give them a significant portion of the total valuation:
   - Items allocated to Agent 1: 1, 3
   - Total valuation for these items: 97 + 97 = 194

2. For the remaining items (0, 2, 4), we will allocate them to **Agent 0** to ensure they receive items that maximize their valuation:
   - Items allocated to Agent 0: 0, 2, 4
   - Total valuation for these items: 76 + 50 + 62 = 188

This allocation gives both agents a fair share, considering the total valuation of items they receive.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
