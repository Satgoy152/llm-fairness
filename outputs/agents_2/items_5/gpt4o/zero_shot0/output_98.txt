Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1  2   3   4
0  51  70  1  51  30
1  72  12  4  84  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or value each agent receives. This problem can resemble a fair division problem where we aim to distribute items in a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation of each agent for all items:

- Agent 0: 51 (item 0) + 70 (item 1) + 1 (item 2) + 51 (item 3) + 30 (item 4) = 203
- Agent 1: 72 (item 0) + 12 (item 1) + 4 (item 2) + 84 (item 3) + 47 (item 4) = 219

We want to maximize fairness by ensuring agents get allocations such that their total valuations for the items they receive are as balanced as possible.

Let's try a distribution:

1. Assign item 0 and item 1 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0's valuation for items 0 and 1: 51 + 70 = 121
2. Assign item 3 and item 4 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1's valuation for items 3 and 4: 84 + 47 = 131
3. The remaining item 2 can be assigned to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0's valuation for items 0, 1, and 2: 121 + 1 = 122

Now, both agents have approximately balanced valuations based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
