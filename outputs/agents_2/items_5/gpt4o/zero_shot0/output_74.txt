Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  66  31  89  68
1  37   6  19  36   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize fairness. Fairness could be interpreted in several ways, such as maximizing total value for each agent, ensuring each agent gets their most valued items, or balancing the total value across agents.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that endeavors to balance the total values received by each agent as much as possible. Here's one way to achieve that:

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**:  
   - Items and Values: (0: 1), (1: 66), (2: 31), (3: 89), (4: 68)

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:  
   - Items and Values: (0: 37), (1: 6), (2: 19), (3: 36), (4: 2)

3. **Total Valuation Per Item**:  
   - Item 0: 1 + 37 = 38
   - Item 1: 66 + 6 = 72
   - Item 2: 31 + 19 = 50
   - Item 3: 89 + 36 = 125
   - Item 4: 68 + 2 = 70

4. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Give items to agents based on their individual highest valuations while being mindful of overall fairness.

#### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest valued items: 3 (value 89), 1 (value 66), 4 (value 68)
  - Total Value: 89 + 66 + 68 = 223

- **Agent 1**:
  - Remaining items: 0 (value 37), 2 (value 19)
  - Total Value: 37 + 19 = 56

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 gets the items they value the most, while Agent 1 receives the remaining items, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items even if the allocation isn't perfectly balanced in terms of value.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This solution aims to allocate items based on maximizing the total perceived value for each agent while ensuring fairness in terms of integer allocations.
