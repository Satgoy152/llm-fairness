Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  79  29  36  54
1  80  85  82   7  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we can use a greedy approach to ensure that each agent receives items of higher value to them. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **List the items and their valuations for each agent:**

   For Agent 0:  
   - Item 0: 51
   - Item 1: 79
   - Item 2: 29
   - Item 3: 36
   - Item 4: 54

   For Agent 1:  
   - Item 0: 80
   - Item 1: 85
   - Item 2: 82
   - Item 3: 7
   - Item 4: 49

2. **Consider the relative valuations for items by both agents and allocate items based on maximizing total satisfaction:**

   - **Item 0:**  
     Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 80.  
     Allocate to Agent 1.

   - **Item 1:**  
     Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 85.  
     Allocate to Agent 1.

   - **Item 2:**  
     Agent 0 values it at 29, Agent 1 values it at 82.  
     Allocate to Agent 1.

   - **Item 3:**  
     Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 7.  
     Allocate to Agent 0.

   - **Item 4:**  
     Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 values it at 49.  
     Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Allocations:**

   - Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 2.

4. **Present allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
