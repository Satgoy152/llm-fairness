Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  99  52   6  70  94
1  26  82  91  95   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their valuations. A straightforward approach is to allocate items in a way that each agent gets items they value more.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [99, 52, 6, 70, 94]
- Agent 1: [26, 82, 91, 95, 2]

A possible fair allocation can be:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 since they value it highly (99 vs. 26).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 since they value it highly (82 vs. 52).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 since they value it highly (91 vs. 6).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 since they value it highly (95 vs. 70).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 since they value it highly (94 vs. 2).

This allocation tries to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
