Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  21  56  85  89
1  56  84  59  23  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One possible method to achieve a fair allocation is to ensure that the total valuation of each agent's allocated items is as balanced as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent would get from various allocations and aim for a fair division:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 56
  - Item 3: 85
  - Item 4: 89

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 23
  - Item 4: 79

One possible allocation that aims to balance the total valuation for each agent is as follows:

- Give items [0, 3, 4] to Agent 0
- Give items [1, 2] to Agent 1

Let's evaluate this allocation:

- Agent 0's total valuation:
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 3: 85
  - Item 4: 89
  - Total: 66 + 85 + 89 = 240

- Agent 1's total valuation:
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 59
  - Total: 84 + 59 = 143

This allocation provides a reasonably fair distribution considering the total valuations. Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and aims to balance their total valuations.
