Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3  4
0  85  55  73  53  3
1  31  98  71  67  8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this:

1. **Initial Analysis**: 
    - Agent 0 values: (0: 85, 1: 55, 2: 73, 3: 53, 4: 3)
    - Agent 1 values: (0: 31, 1: 98, 2: 71, 3: 67, 4: 8)

2. **Optimal Allocation Strategy**:
    - Assign items to the agent that values them more highly.
    - Consider the overall value distribution to ensure fairness.

3. **Assign Items**:
    - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 31. Assign to Agent 0.
    - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 at 98. Assign to Agent 1.
    - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 71. Assign to Agent 0.
    - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 at 67. Assign to Agent 1.
    - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 at 8. Assign to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation**:
    - Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2
    - Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 4

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
