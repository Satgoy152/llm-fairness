Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  84  13  23  81
1  95  33  98  20  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's valuation of the items they receive. A common approach is to use the "envy-free" allocation or "maximum sum of valuations" method.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and then allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction.

### Agent Valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 87
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 13
  - Item 3: 23
  - Item 4: 81
  - **Total Valuation:** 87 + 84 + 13 + 23 + 81 = 288

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 33
  - Item 2: 98
  - Item 3: 20
  - Item 4: 70
  - **Total Valuation:** 95 + 33 + 98 + 20 + 70 = 316

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Assign items based on highest individual valuations to maximize satisfaction for each agent.**
   
2. **Agent 0's Highest Valuation Items**:
   - Item 0: 87
   - Item 1: 84
   - Item 4: 81

3. **Agent 1's Highest Valuation Items**:
   - Item 2: 98
   - Item 0: 95
   - Item 4: 70

### Allocation Process:

- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 2 (98), so assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 0 (95), so assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (84), so assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 4 (81), but Agent 1 also highly values it (70). To balance, assign Item 4 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 would be more dissatisfied without it.
- Finally, assign Item 3 to Agent 0 as a balancing item.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items maximizing their individual satisfaction based on the given valuations.
