Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  53  11  10  58
1  30  76  25  93  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it more, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated to each agent is balanced.

Given the valuations:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 90 | 53 | 11 | 10 | 58 |
| 1          | 30 | 76 | 25 | 93 | 44 |

Let's go through the items and assign them:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 90, and Agent 1 values it at 30. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 53, and Agent 1 values it at 76. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 11, and Agent 1 values it at 25. Assign to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 10, and Agent 1 values it at 93. Assign to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 58, and Agent 1 values it at 44. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. We have:

- Agent 0 has items [0, 4]
- Agent 1 has items [1, 2, 3]

This allocation gives each agent a fair number of items considering their valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
