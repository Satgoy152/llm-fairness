Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  22  90  20   5
1  62  84  62  51  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider how to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring an integer number of items is allocated to each.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has valuations: [98, 22, 90, 20, 5]
- Agent 1 has valuations: [62, 84, 62, 51, 15]

We want to maximize the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to allocate the items by considering the highest valuation differences between agents, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 98.
   - Agent 1 values it at 62.
   - Difference: 36 (Agent 0 would prefer this item more)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 22.
   - Agent 1 values it at 84.
   - Difference: 62 (Agent 1 would prefer this item more)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 90.
   - Agent 1 values it at 62.
   - Difference: 28 (Agent 0 would prefer this item more)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 20.
   - Agent 1 values it at 51.
   - Difference: 31 (Agent 1 would prefer this item more)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5.
   - Agent 1 values it at 15.
   - Difference: 10 (Agent 1 would prefer this item more)

By assigning items based on who values them more, we can propose the following allocation:

- Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation differences in favor of Agent 0.
- Assign items 1, 3, and 4 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation differences in favor of Agent 1.

Now, let's format the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
