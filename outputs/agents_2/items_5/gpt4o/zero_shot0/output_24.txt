Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34  42  87  59   9
1  49  42  96  31  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach to maximize the total value each agent receives. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item:** This helps in understanding which agent values an item more and should ideally get it.
2. **Determine Allocation Strategy:** Assign each item to the agent who values it more, ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate each item based on the agents' valuations:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 49. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 values it at 42. Either can take it, but for balance, assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 96. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 59, Agent 1 values it at 31. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 values it at 30. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure both agents receive a fair number of items. Currently, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 4]

Agent 0 has 2 items, and Agent 1 has 3 items. This is fair in terms of integer distribution, considering the valuation balance. 

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
