Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  75   9  81  93
1  64  86  46   9  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives. One simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the items, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

First, let's list the items and their valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 81
  - Item 4: 93

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 46
  - Item 3: 9
  - Item 4: 42

We'll allocate items to the agent who values them the most. If there's a tie or close valuations, we can consider the overall balance to ensure fairness.

1. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 values it at 42. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 values it at 9. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 86, Agent 0 values it at 75. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 64, Agent 0 values it at 54. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 46, Agent 0 values it at 9. Allocate to Agent 1.

After these allocations, Agent 0 has received 2 items, and Agent 1 has received 3 items.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
