Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  62   5  74  72
1  35  39  13  83  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 35.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 39.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 values it at 13.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 values it at 83.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 values it at 73.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Allocate to Agent 0 (51 > 35).
   - Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0 (62 > 39).
   - Item 2: Allocate to Agent 1 (13 > 5).
   - Item 3: Allocate to Agent 1 (83 > 74).
   - Item 4: Allocate to Agent 1 (73 > 72).

3. **Review the Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 1 gets items 2, 3, and 4.

4. **Check Fairness:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 51 (Item 0) + 62 (Item 1) = 113.
   - Agent 1's total value: 13 (Item 2) + 83 (Item 3) + 73 (Item 4) = 169.

This allocation maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
