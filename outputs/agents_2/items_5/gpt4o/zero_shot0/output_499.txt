Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  95  28  71  96
1  59  40  67  30  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and ideally, the allocation should maximize the total valuation for both agents. Here is a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

1. **List the total valuations of each agent for all items:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 94 + 95 + 28 + 71 + 96 = 384
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 59 + 40 + 67 + 30 + 72 = 268

2. **Allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:**
   - Since the total number of items is 5, one agent will get 2 items and the other will get 3 items.
   
3. **Determine the most valuable items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values: [94, 95, 28, 71, 96]
   - Agent 1 values: [59, 40, 67, 30, 72]

4. **Allocate items considering both agents' preferences:**
   - Agent 0's highest valued items are items 4, 1, and 0.
   - Agent 1's highest valued items are items 2, 4, and 0.

5. **Find a fair allocation:**
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 because it's highly valued.
   - Allocate item 1 and item 0 to Agent 0 as they are also highly valued.
   - Allocate item 2 and item 3 to Agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items with the highest total valuation and Agent 1 the remaining items, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
