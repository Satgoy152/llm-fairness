Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  79  89  18  87
1  24  12  44  44  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: [44, 79, 89, 18, 87]
- Agent 1: [24, 12, 44, 44, 74]

We will allocate the items in such a way that each agent's total value from the items they receive is as high as possible, considering both agents' valuations.

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item the highest (89 vs. 44). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item significantly higher (79 vs. 12). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this item higher (87 vs. 74). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 0**: Assign this to Agent 0 (44 vs. 24), as there are still more items to balance the allocation.
5. **Item 3**: Since Agent 1 values this item equally (44 vs. 18), assign it to Agent 1 to balance the number of items allocated.

After this allocation, Agent 0 receives four items, and Agent 1 receives one item. Since we need to ensure both agents get an integer number of items, let's adjust for a more balanced distribution:

- Let's give item 3 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 has the same valuation for item 3 as Agent 0, and Agent 1 has not received any item yet.

Now, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3]
}
```

This distribution gives Agent 0 a higher total valuation, which is common in cases where one agent values the items significantly higher across the board, but it ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items.
