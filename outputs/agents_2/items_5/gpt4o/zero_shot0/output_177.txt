Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   9  25  13   5  82
1  61  73   3  53  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we will use a strategy to allocate items based on maximizing the individual valuations for each agent.

First, let's list the items in descending order of the difference in valuation between the two agents:

1. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 values it at 27. Difference = 55.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 73, Agent 0 values it at 25. Difference = 48.
3. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 61, Agent 0 values it at 9. Difference = 52.
4. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 3. Difference = 10.
5. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 53, Agent 0 values it at 5. Difference = 48.

Using this information, let's allocate the items:

- Items 4 and 2 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 has a significantly higher valuation for these items.
- Items 1, 0, and 3 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 has a significantly higher valuation for these items.

This allocation approach maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
