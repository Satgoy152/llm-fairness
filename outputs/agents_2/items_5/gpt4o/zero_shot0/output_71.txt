Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  41  55  31  32
1  84  83   9  86  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that both agents receive an integer number of items.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 5
  - Item 1: 41
  - Item 2: 55
  - Item 3: 31
  - Item 4: 32

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 86
  - Item 4: 87

We need to allocate the 5 items between the two agents. Let's try to allocate items by considering the highest difference in valuations between agents for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it significantly higher (84 vs 5). Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it slightly higher (83 vs 41). Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it significantly higher (55 vs 9). Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it higher (86 vs 31). Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it higher (87 vs 32). Allocate to Agent 1.

Now we have:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3, 4

However, Agent 0 only has one item, and we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and a fair share. Let's adjust to give Agent 0 a more balanced allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 (84 vs 5)
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 (83 vs 41)
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 (55 vs 9)
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 (31 vs 86) - to balance the allocation
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 (32 vs 87) - to balance the allocation

Now we have:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 55 + 31 + 32 = 118.
Agent 1 receives a total valuation of 84 + 83 = 167.

Both agents receive two items, and the allocation attempts to maximize each agent's valuation given the constraints.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
