Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  34   1  35  76  62
1  78  77   9  68  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, we have 5 items and 2 agents, so one agent will receive 3 items and the other will receive 2 items.

We can use a simple greedy approach to allocate the items. First, we will calculate the total value each agent assigns to each item and allocate the items to the agent who values them the most. The goal is to maximize the value for both agents.

Let's evaluate the value each agent assigns to each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 78.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 values it at 77.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 values it at 9.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 68.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 97.

Now, let's allocate items based on which agent values them most:

1. Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1 (78 > 34)
2. Item 1: Allocate to Agent 1 (77 > 1)
3. Item 2: Allocate to Agent 0 (35 > 9)
4. Item 3: Allocate to Agent 0 (76 > 68)
5. Item 4: Allocate to Agent 1 (97 > 62)

To ensure an integer number of items for each agent, we aim to allocate 3 items to one agent and 2 items to the other. Based on the above allocation, Agent 1 currently has 3 items and Agent 0 has 2 items, which satisfies the requirement.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing their valuations.
