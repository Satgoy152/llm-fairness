Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  36  87  66  25
1  33  34  39  55  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent. We'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 36 + 36 + 87 + 66 + 25 = 250
- Agent 1's total valuation: 33 + 34 + 39 + 55 + 57 = 218

Now, let's try to allocate items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives while keeping the number of items as equal as possible. We will consider each agent's valuation for each item and allocate items one at a time.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 0, so assign it to Agent 0.
2. Item 4 has the highest valuation from Agent 1, so assign it to Agent 1.
3. Item 3 has a higher valuation from Agent 0 (66 vs. 55), so assign it to Agent 0.
4. Item 0 has a slightly higher valuation from Agent 0 (36) than Agent 1 (33), so assign it to Agent 0.
5. Item 1 is the remaining item, assign it to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 3, and 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 1.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 0],
    "1": [4, 1]
}
```
