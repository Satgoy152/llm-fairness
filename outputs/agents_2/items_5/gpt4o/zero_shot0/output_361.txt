Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  22  89  61  34
1  91  17  92  24  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. Here's one way to perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value = 74
   - Item 1: Value = 22
   - Item 2: Value = 89
   - Item 3: Value = 61
   - Item 4: Value = 34

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0: Value = 91
   - Item 1: Value = 17
   - Item 2: Value = 92
   - Item 3: Value = 24
   - Item 4: Value = 92

To maximize the total value, we'll try to allocate the items such that each agent has a higher cumulative valuation for the items they receive:

- Agent 0: Has a high valuation for items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1: Has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.

Let's find an allocation that seems fair:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (higher value for agent 1).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (both have low value, but slightly better for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (same high value for both, but Agent 0 can get more value from other items).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (higher value for agent 0).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (higher value for agent 1).

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items that add up to a higher total value based on their preferences, while Agent 1 receives the items that maximize their overall valuation.
