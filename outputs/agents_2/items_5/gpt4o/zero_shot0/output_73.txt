Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59   9  16  32  81
1  89  63  81  53  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 59 + 9 + 16 + 32 + 81 = 197
   - Agent 1: 89 + 63 + 81 + 53 + 67 = 353

2. Sort the items based on the difference in valuation between the two agents. This helps us to assign the items where one agent values it significantly more than the other:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values more (89 vs 59)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values more (63 vs 9)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values more (81 vs 16)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values more (32 vs 53)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values more (67 vs 81)

3. Allocate items based on maximizing the individual agent's total value within available items:
   - Agent 1 gets items 0, 1, and 2 since these have higher valuations for them.
   - Agent 0 gets items 3 and 4 since they have a relatively higher total value for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.

Therefore, the fair allocation of items is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and takes into account their individual valuations to maximize fairness.
