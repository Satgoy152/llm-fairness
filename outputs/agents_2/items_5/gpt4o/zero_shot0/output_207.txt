Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  37  42  35  21  18
1  79   7  43   4  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm that considers the highest value an agent places on an item and allocates accordingly, ensuring each agent receives a fair portion of the total value.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0: 37 + 42 + 35 + 21 + 18 = 153
- Agent 1: 79 + 7 + 43 + 4 + 14 = 147

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 79, which is higher than Agent 0's 37.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 42, which is higher than Agent 1's 7.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 43, which is higher than Agent 0's 35.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 21, which is higher than Agent 1's 4.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 18, which is higher than Agent 1's 14.

Allocating based on these preferences, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2

Now, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
