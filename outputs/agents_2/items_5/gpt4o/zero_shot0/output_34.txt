Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  55  79   0  30
1  85  62   3  62  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since we have two agents and five items, one agent will receive three items, and the other will receive two items.

Let's first consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 36 + 55 + 79 + 0 + 30 = 200
- Agent 1's total valuation: 85 + 62 + 3 + 62 + 19 = 231

We can consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Prioritize giving each agent the items for which they have the highest relative valuation.
2. Ensure each agent receives the required number of items (agent 0 gets 3 items, and agent 1 gets 2 items).

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prioritize items with the highest value according to agent 0's preference.
   - Item 2 has the highest value (79) for agent 0.
   - Item 1 is the second highest (55) for agent 0.
   - Item 0 is the next highest (36) for agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prioritize items with the highest value according to agent 1's preference.
   - Item 0 has the highest value (85) for agent 1.
   - Item 3 has the same value as item 1 for agent 1 (62), but since item 1 is already allocated to agent 0, item 3 is chosen.

### Final Allocation

Based on the above strategy, we allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0** receives items [2, 1, 0]
- **Agent 1** receives items [3, 4]

### JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 0],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items while attempting to maximize the total value they receive based on their preferences.
