Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  30  32  81   0
1  50   8  71  19  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly.

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 14  
- Item 1: 30  
- Item 2: 32  
- Item 3: 81  
- Item 4: 0  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 50  
- Item 1: 8  
- Item 2: 71  
- Item 3: 19  
- Item 4: 97  

A possible approach is to allocate items such that each agent gets a set of items that maximizes their total valuation score. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the highest (97).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the highest (81).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it highly (71).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 does (50 vs 14).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 does (30 vs 8).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a manner that maximizes their satisfaction based on their given valuations.
