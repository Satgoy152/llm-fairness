Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  16  64  51  92  66
1  45  98  21  45  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. One common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent ends up with an approximately equal total value.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [16, 64, 51, 92, 66]
- Agent 1: [45, 98, 21, 45, 31]

Let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Total value for Agent 0: 16 + 64 + 51 + 92 + 66 = 289
- Total value for Agent 1: 45 + 98 + 21 + 45 + 31 = 240

The goal is to split the items so that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Let's try to allocate items to balance the total value each agent receives.

Allocating items:

1. Item 3 (Agent 0 values it highest at 92, Agent 1 values it at 45)
2. Item 1 (Agent 1 values it highest at 98, Agent 0 values it at 64)
3. Item 4 (Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 values it at 31)
4. Item 0 (Agent 1 values it at 45, Agent 0 values it at 16)
5. Item 2 (Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 values it at 21)

Possible allocation based on maximizing individual agent value while balancing total value:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0

After this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 3, 4, 2
  - Total value: 92 + 66 + 51 = 209
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 0
  - Total value: 98 + 45 = 143

This allocation favors Agent 0 more significantly. To balance it further, we can try to find a fairer allocation by swapping some items:

Reallocate:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (92)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (98)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (66)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (21)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (45)

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 3, 4
  - Total value: 92 + 66 = 158
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 0, 2
  - Total value: 98 + 45 + 21 = 164

This allocation is more balanced:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 0, 2]
}
```
