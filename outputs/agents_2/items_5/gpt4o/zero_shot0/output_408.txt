Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  48  69  41  13
1  67  59  50  45  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common method is to ensure that the total value of the items received by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's go through the process and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 23.
   - Agent 1 values it at 67.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 48.
   - Agent 1 values it at 59.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 69.
   - Agent 1 values it at 50.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 41.
   - Agent 1 values it at 45.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 13.
   - Agent 1 values it at 36.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

Let's check the total values each agent receives:
- Agent 0: Item 2 (69)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3, 4 (67 + 59 + 45 + 36 = 207)

This allocation is heavily skewed toward Agent 1. To improve fairness, let's try an alternative approach that considers total valuation:

1. **Reallocation Attempt**:
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (high valuation).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (high valuation).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (second-highest individual valuation after item 2).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (somewhat balanced valuation).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (remaining item).

Now, let's reevaluate:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 1, 4 (69 + 48 + 13 = 130)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3 (67 + 45 = 112)

This allocation is more balanced. Hence, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
