Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  61  13  11  80
1   5  49  96  24  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while taking into consideration their valuations, one common approach is to use the "envy-free" concept in fair division. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle, given their valuations.

Let's evaluate different allocations to find a fair one:

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 13
  - Item 3: 11
  - Item 4: 80

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 5
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 24
  - Item 4: 42

### Total Valuations for Each Agent:
- Agent 0: 54 + 61 + 13 + 11 + 80 = 219
- Agent 1: 5 + 49 + 96 + 24 + 42 = 216

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as equal as possible.

Let's consider the highest value items for each agent:

- **Agent 0** values item 4 (80) the most.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 (96) the most.

Let's try the following allocation:
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items while trying to maintain balance:

#### Remaining Items:
Items 0, 1, and 3 need to be allocated.

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it at 54, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 5).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it at 49, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 61, but we need to balance the total values).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it at 24, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 11).

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 2, 3]

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the total value as evenly as possible between the two agents based on their individual valuations.
