Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  60  87   3  62
1  39  10  57  66  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here's how it can be done with the given data:

1. Agent 0 and Agent 1's valuations are compared for each item.
2. Each item is assigned to the agent who has the higher valuation for that item.
3. Ensure both agents end up with an integer number of items.

Let's apply this method to the table:

- For item 0, Agent 0 values it at 94, and Agent 1 values it at 39. It goes to Agent 0.
- For item 1, Agent 0 values it at 60, and Agent 1 values it at 10. It goes to Agent 0.
- For item 2, Agent 0 values it at 87, and Agent 1 values it at 57. It goes to Agent 0.
- For item 3, Agent 0 values it at 3, and Agent 1 values it at 66. It goes to Agent 1.
- For item 4, Agent 0 values it at 62, and Agent 1 values it at 39. It goes to Agent 0.

After allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3]
}
```
