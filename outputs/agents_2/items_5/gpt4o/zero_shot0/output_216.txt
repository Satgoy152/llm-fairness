Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  82   4  98  84
1  97  84  72  63  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are assigned. A simple approach is to use a greedy method where each item is assigned to the agent who values it most. Let's go through the items one by one:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it at 97, while Agent 0 values it at 39. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 82, while Agent 1 values it at 84. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 4, while Agent 1 values it at 72. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 98, while Agent 1 values it at 63. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 84, while Agent 1 values it at 60. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

Now let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
