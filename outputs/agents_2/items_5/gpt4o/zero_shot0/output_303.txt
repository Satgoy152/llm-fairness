Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  83  17  24  50
1  26  70  61  28  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the agents' valuations, aiming for a fair distribution of total value.

Let's begin by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 4 + 83 + 17 + 24 + 50 = 178
- Agent 1: 26 + 70 + 61 + 28 + 55 = 240

Next, we will allocate items to maximize fairness and perceived value for each agent. We aim to balance these valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least two items.

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 83, which is the highest individual valuation for Agent 0.
   
2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 61, which is a high valuation for Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values Item 4 at 55, which contributes significantly to their total valuation.

4. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 26, which helps in maximizing their total value.

5. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 24, which is the best remaining option after other allocations.

After allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 has items 1 and 3 with values (83 + 24 = 107).
- Agent 1 has items 0, 2, and 4 with values (26 + 61 + 55 = 142).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
