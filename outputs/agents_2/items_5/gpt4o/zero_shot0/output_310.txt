Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  97  18  98  41
1   5  24  27   7  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach that considers the valuations of each agent for each item. One possible method is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring a balanced distribution of items between the agents. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. List the items alongside their valuations for both agents.
2. Determine the agent who values each item the most.
3. Allocate the items while ensuring each agent receives approximately half of the total number of items, as there are 5 items and 2 agents.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0 values at 91
  - Agent 1 values at 5
  - Allocate to Agent 0

- Item 1: 
  - Agent 0 values at 97
  - Agent 1 values at 24
  - Allocate to Agent 0

- Item 2: 
  - Agent 0 values at 18
  - Agent 1 values at 27
  - Allocate to Agent 1

- Item 3: 
  - Agent 0 values at 98
  - Agent 1 values at 7
  - Allocate to Agent 0

- Item 4: 
  - Agent 0 values at 41
  - Agent 1 values at 64
  - Allocate to Agent 1

This initial allocation gives Agent 0 three items and Agent 1 two items. Therefore, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
