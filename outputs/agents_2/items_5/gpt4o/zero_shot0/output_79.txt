Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  58  86  45  46
1  54  95   6  13  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we should consider the value that each agent places on each item and try to optimize accordingly.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 86
  - Item 3: 45
  - Item 4: 46

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 6
  - Item 3: 13
  - Item 4: 96

To achieve a fair allocation, let's try to maximize the combined satisfaction of the agents by assigning the items where they have higher relative valuations.

A potential fair allocation could be:
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (54 vs 40)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (95 vs 58)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (86 vs 6)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (45 vs 13)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (96 vs 46)

With this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3 (total valuation: 86 + 45 = 131)
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 4 (total valuation: 54 + 95 + 96 = 245)

This distribution gives a fair allocation based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
