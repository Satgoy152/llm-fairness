Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  25  20  39  27
1  78  39  14  32  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of both agents. One common approach is to maximize the sum of the valuations for each agent's allocated items. Here's how we can do it based on the given table:

Agent 0 valuations:
- Item 0: 81
- Item 1: 25
- Item 2: 20
- Item 3: 39
- Item 4: 27

Agent 1 valuations:
- Item 0: 78
- Item 1: 39
- Item 2: 14
- Item 3: 32
- Item 4: 87

A possible allocation can be achieved by making sure that each agent gets the items that they value most while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. 

One possible allocation is:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 4

Let's check the total valuation for each agent:
- Agent 0: 81 (Item 0) + 25 (Item 1) = 106
- Agent 1: 14 (Item 2) + 32 (Item 3) + 87 (Item 4) = 133

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two or three items and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
