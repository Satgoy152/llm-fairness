Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60   0  64  77  56
1  58  15  12  98  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will iterate through the items and assign them to the agent who values them most until all items are allocated. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 60, and Agent 1 values it at 58. Therefore, assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 0, and Agent 1 values it at 15. Therefore, assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 64, and Agent 1 values it at 12. Therefore, assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 77, and Agent 1 values it at 98. Therefore, assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 56, and Agent 1 values it at 16. Therefore, assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

After allocation, the distribution of items is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
