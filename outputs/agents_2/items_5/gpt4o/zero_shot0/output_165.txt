Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  70  44  82  39
1  70  69  15  20  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total value, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 27
- Item 1: 70
- Item 2: 44
- Item 3: 82
- Item 4: 39

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 70
- Item 1: 69
- Item 2: 15
- Item 3: 20
- Item 4: 75

We can use a simple greedy approach, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through each item:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0: 27 
   - Agent 1: 70 
   - Assign to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 0: 70 
   - Agent 1: 69 
   - Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 0: 44 
   - Agent 1: 15 
   - Assign to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Agent 0: 82 
   - Agent 1: 20 
   - Assign to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Agent 0: 39 
   - Agent 1: 75 
   - Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value most, and similarly for Agent 1, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
