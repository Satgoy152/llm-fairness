Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  90  87  33  46
1  37  56  32  58  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing the total value for each agent, we can use a greedy approach where each agent gets the items they value the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. List the value of each item for both agents.
2. Allocate the items to the agent that values them the most.
3. Ensure that the total number of items each agent receives is an integer.

Here is the allocation process:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 71, and Agent 1 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 90, and Agent 1 values it at 56. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 87, and Agent 1 values it at 32. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 33, and Agent 1 values it at 58. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 46, and Agent 1 values it at 50. Allocate to Agent 1.

Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 2] and Agent 1 receives items [3, 4].

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
