Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  71  68  96  58
1  38   0   3  94  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. Since there are 5 items and 2 agents, each agent can receive either 2 or 3 items.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would get with different allocations and choose the one that maximizes fairness:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Valuations: [79, 71, 68, 96, 58]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Valuations: [38, 0, 3, 94, 20]

We can use a greedy approach to allocate items based on who values them more highly.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Item 3:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 values it at 94. 
  - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

- **Item 0:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 38.
  - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

- **Item 1:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 values it at 0.
  - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

- **Item 2:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 values it at 3.
  - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

- **Item 4:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 20.
  - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

However, this allocation gives all items to Agent 0. To ensure fairness, we should adjust the allocation to give some items to Agent 1.

### Adjusted Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** 
  - Items: [0, 1, 3]
  - Total Value: 79 + 71 + 96 = 246

- **Agent 1:**
  - Items: [2, 4]
  - Total Value: 3 + 20 = 23

This allocation is not fair; hence, let's adjust it again to balance the total values better.

### Fair Allocation:
Let's re-evaluate the items:

- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1** (Agent 1 values it highly at 94):
  - Agent 0: [0, 1]
  - Agent 1: [3]

- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0** (Agent 0 values it highly):
  - Agent 0: [0, 1]
  - Agent 1: [3]

- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0** (Agent 0 values it highly):
  - Agent 0: [0, 1]
  - Agent 1: [3]

- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1** (Agent 1 needs more items):
  - Agent 0: [0, 1]
  - Agent 1: [3, 2]

- **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1** (balance the count of items):
  - Agent 0: [0, 1]
  - Agent 1: [3, 2, 4]

This provides a more balanced allocation in terms of item count, even if not perfectly balanced in value.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has a fair share in terms of the number of items.
