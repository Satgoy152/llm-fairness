Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  46  43  51  21
1  98  86  48  16  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a simple approach to achieve that:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each combination of items for both agents.
2. Allocate items to maximize the total valuation for both agents.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

- Agent 0's valuations: [48, 46, 43, 51, 21]
- Agent 1's valuations: [98, 86, 48, 16, 16]

One potential fair allocation is to give each agent the items that maximize their own valuation, considering the constraint that each item can only be allocated to one agent.

Here's a possible allocation:
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (98), so it makes sense to allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 1 also highly values item 1 (86), so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (51), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 0 also values item 2 reasonably high (43), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- The remaining item, item 4, is valued equally low by both agents, but we can allocate it to Agent 0 since Agent 1 already has a higher total valuation from items 0 and 1.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]

Thus, the allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
