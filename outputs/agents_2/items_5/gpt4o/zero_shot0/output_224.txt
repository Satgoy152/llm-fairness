Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  96  47   1  37
1  37   9   4  30  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes the total value for each agent. One common method is to use a greedy algorithm where we allocate items to the agent who values them the most until all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate items:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 55
   - Agent 1 values it at 37
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96
   - Agent 1 values it at 9
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 47
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 1
   - Agent 1 values it at 30
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 37
   - Agent 1 values it at 16
   - Allocate to Agent 0

Based on this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3]
}
```
