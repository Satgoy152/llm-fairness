Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  65  70  77  75
1   5  22  68  60  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly.

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 15  
- Item 1: 65  
- Item 2: 70  
- Item 3: 77  
- Item 4: 75  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 5  
- Item 1: 22  
- Item 2: 68  
- Item 3: 60  
- Item 4: 49  

One approach is to allocate the items to the agent who values them the most:

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 15.  
   - Agent 1 values it at 5.  
   - Allocate to Agent 0.  

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 65.  
   - Agent 1 values it at 22.  
   - Allocate to Agent 0.  

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 70.  
   - Agent 1 values it at 68.  
   - Allocate to Agent 0.  

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 77.  
   - Agent 1 values it at 60.  
   - Allocate to Agent 0.  

5. **Item 4**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 75.  
   - Agent 1 values it at 49.  
   - Allocate to Agent 0.  

In this allocation, Agent 0 gets all the items because they have higher valuations for each item compared to Agent 1. However, this does not provide a fair distribution as Agent 1 receives nothing. Let's attempt a different allocation strategy:

- Allocate **Item 2** and **Item 3** to Agent 1, as these are the items they value relatively highly compared to other items.
- Allocate **Item 0**, **Item 1**, and **Item 4** to Agent 0, as they value these items significantly more compared to Agent 1's valuation.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the valuation both agents derive from their allocated items.
