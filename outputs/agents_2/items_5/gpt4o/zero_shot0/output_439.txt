Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48  21  97  94  43
1  70  27  89  84   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We'll try to assign items in such a way that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible, taking into consideration their individual preferences for each item.

Let's evaluate the values:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 48
- Item 1: 21
- Item 2: 97
- Item 3: 94
- Item 4: 43

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 70
- Item 1: 27
- Item 2: 89
- Item 3: 84
- Item 4: 8

We aim to allocate the items so that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations. One feasible approach is to assign items in a manner that balances the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 2 has high valuations for both agents, but Agent 0 values it more (97 vs. 89). Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Item 3 also has high valuations for both agents, but Agent 0 values it slightly more (94 vs. 84). However, to balance the distribution, assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Compare remaining items:
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 48, and Agent 1 values it at 70. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 21, and Agent 1 values it at 27. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Item 4 has a higher valuation from Agent 0 (43 vs. 8). Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

With this allocation strategy, the distribution will be:

Agent 0:
- Total value = 97 (Item 2) + 43 (Item 4) = 140

Agent 1:
- Total value = 70 (Item 0) + 27 (Item 1) + 84 (Item 3) = 181

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
