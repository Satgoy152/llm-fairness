Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  68   0  25  43
1  95   3  58  91  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use the strategy of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. Let's analyze the given valuations and allocate the items in a way that each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible based on the valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 0
  - Item 3: 25
  - Item 4: 43

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 91
  - Item 4: 78

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each gets an integer number of items:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 81.
   - Agent 1 values it at 95.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 68.
   - Agent 1 values it at 3.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 0.
   - Agent 1 values it at 58.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 25.
   - Agent 1 values it at 91.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 43.
   - Agent 1 values it at 78.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

Allocations based on the above analysis:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives item 1, and Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, 3, and 4. This allocation maximizes each agent's total valuation based on the given table.
