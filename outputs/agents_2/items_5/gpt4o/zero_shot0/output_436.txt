Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  86  70  75  12
1  37  43  50   0  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We analyze the given valuations to find an optimal distribution. 

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: [76, 86, 70, 75, 12]
- Agent 1: [37, 43, 50, 0, 12]

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 1** (highest value for Agent 0): 
   - Agent 0 values it at 86, Agent 1 at 43. 
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 0** (second highest for Agent 0):
   - Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 37.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2** (highest for Agent 1):
   - Agent 0 values it at 70, Agent 1 at 50.
   - Allocate to Agent 0, but since Agent 1 needs to get some valuable items, we consider Agent 1's need for value and reallocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 at 0.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4** (least valued by both):
   - Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 12.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 for balance.

Considering the above allocations and aiming to balance the total value:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 3].
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 4].

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 237 and Agent 1 a total value of 62.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
