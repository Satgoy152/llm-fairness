Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  92   8  57  78
1  21  61  36  21  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:

1. **Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Item by Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: [0, 92, 8, 57, 78]
   - Agent 1: [21, 61, 36, 21, 74]

2. **Assign Each Item to the Agent that Values it More**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 21, while Agent 0 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 92, while Agent 1 values it at 61. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 36, while Agent 0 values it at 8. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 21. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 78, while Agent 1 values it at 74. Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Allocate the Items**:
   - Agent 0 gets items: 1, 3, 4
   - Agent 1 gets items: 0, 2

Therefore, the allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
