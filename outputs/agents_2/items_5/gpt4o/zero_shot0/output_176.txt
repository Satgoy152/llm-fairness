Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  83  73  20  62   9
1   7  98  75  81  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 98 75 81 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the satisfaction of both agents.

Here's a step-by-step reasoning based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:** [83, 73, 20, 62, 9]
2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** [7, 98, 75, 81, 56]

We aim to allocate the items such that the total value for each agent is as high as possible.

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it much higher (83) than Agent 1 (7). Thus, it makes sense for Agent 0 to receive Item 0.
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it significantly more (98) than Agent 0 (73). So, Item 1 should go to Agent 1.
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it more (75) compared to Agent 0 (20). Thus, it should be allocated to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it more (81) compared to Agent 0 (62). Therefore, Item 3 should be given to Agent 1.
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it more (56) compared to Agent 0 (9). Hence, Item 4 should go to Agent 1.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
