Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  63  79  53  25
1  66  10  65  54  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 10 65 54 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Here's the valuation table again for reference:

```
Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  
-----------|----|----|----|----|---
Agent 0    | 27 | 63 | 79 | 53 | 25  
Agent 1    | 66 | 10 | 65 | 54 | 12  
```

We want to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. We will attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. 

Let's consider a possible allocation based on maximizing the sum of values:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 27.
   - Agent 1 values it at 66.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 for higher value.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 63.
   - Agent 1 values it at 10.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 for higher value.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79.
   - Agent 1 values it at 65.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 for higher value.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 53.
   - Agent 1 values it at 54.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 for higher value.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 25.
   - Agent 1 values it at 12.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 for higher value.

This allocation provides the following distribution:

- **Agent 0** gets items: 1, 2, 4
- **Agent 1** gets items: 0, 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
