Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  22   1  19  26
1  34  95  72  58  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the values each agent assigns to each item. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent by allocating items to the agent that values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 57.
   - Agent 1 values it at 34.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 22.
   - Agent 1 values it at 95.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 1.
   - Agent 1 values it at 72.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 19.
   - Agent 1 values it at 58.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 26.
   - Agent 1 values it at 42.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

With these allocations, Agent 0 receives Item 0, and Agent 1 receives Items 1, 2, 3, and 4. This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
