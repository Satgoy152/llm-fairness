Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49   1  61  63  36
1  67  46  56  36  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent gets. This problem can be approached using a simple greedy algorithm or optimization strategy. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets an approximately equal share of their total possible value.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then try to distribute items to balance the values:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 49 + 1 + 61 + 63 + 36 = 210
- Agent 1's total valuation: 67 + 46 + 56 + 36 + 89 = 294

Now, we'll allocate the items to balance these valuations as closely as possible:

1. Sort the items by the difference in valuations between the two agents.

   ```
   Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (89 vs 36, difference 53)
   Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (67 vs 49, difference 18)
   Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (61 vs 56, difference 5)
   Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (63 vs 36, difference 27)
   Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (46 vs 1, difference 45)
   ```

2. Allocate items starting from the largest difference favoring the agent with the higher valuation:

   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1

3. Evaluate the allocation:

   - Agent 0 receives items [2, 3] with total valuation: 61 + 63 = 124
   - Agent 1 receives items [0, 1, 4] with total valuation: 67 + 46 + 89 = 202

This allocation ensures both agents get a fair share according to their valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
