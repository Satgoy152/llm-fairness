Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  54  96  58   9
1  54  43  81  70  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an allocation method that maximizes total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One way to approach this is by calculating the total value each agent assigns to each item and then trying to distribute the items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's look at the value table again:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  54  96  58   9
1  54  43  81  70  32
```

We will assign items to the agents based on which agent values each item more, ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 54. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 at 43. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 at 81. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 at 70. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 9, Agent 1 at 32. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive an integer number of items, and each item is allocated to the agent who values it more.
