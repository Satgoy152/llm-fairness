Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  98  11  72  69
1  16  38  31  53  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We can use a greedy approach to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the items one by one:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 19, and Agent 1 values it at 16. Thus, Item 0 should be assigned to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 98, and Agent 1 values it at 38. Thus, Item 1 should be assigned to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 11, and Agent 1 values it at 31. Thus, Item 2 should be assigned to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 72, and Agent 1 values it at 53. Thus, Item 3 should be assigned to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 69, and Agent 1 values it at 91. Thus, Item 4 should be assigned to Agent 1.

Now, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. In this simple case, both agents naturally receive an integer number of items. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
