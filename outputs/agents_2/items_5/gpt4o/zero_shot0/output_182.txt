Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  35  79  28  35
1  15  31  76   3   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 8.
   - Agent 1 values it at 15.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 35.
   - Agent 1 values it at 31.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79.
   - Agent 1 values it at 76.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 28.
   - Agent 1 values it at 3.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 35.
   - Agent 1 values it at 1.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0]
}
```
