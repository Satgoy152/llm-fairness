Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  73  79   7  89
1  36  10   0  63  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. One simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51.
   - Agent 1 values it at 36.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 73.
   - Agent 1 values it at 10.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79.
   - Agent 1 values it at 0.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 7.
   - Agent 1 values it at 63.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89.
   - Agent 1 values it at 22.
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

The final allocation, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.
