Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   7  67  32  55  30
1  59  46  98  51  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here is one approach to achieve the allocation:

1. **Compute Total Valuation for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 7 + 67 + 32 + 55 + 30 = 191
   - Agent 1: 59 + 46 + 98 + 51 + 63 = 317

2. **Allocate Items by Maximizing Valuation**:
   - We will attempt to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while trying to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

3. **Assign Items**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 59, Agent 0 values it at 7. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 values it at 46. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 98, Agent 0 values it at 32. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 51. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 63, Agent 0 values it at 30. Assign to Agent 1.

4. **Check Total Valuations**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3, with total valuation: 67 + 55 = 122
   - Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 4, with total valuation: 59 + 98 + 63 = 220

5. **Adjust if Needed**:
   - To make the allocation fairer, adjust allocations if possible. Here, the current allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share of their total satisfaction. 

The allocations, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
