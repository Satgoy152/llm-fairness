Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  69  48  48  71
1  83  11   0  45  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 11  0 45 38]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can look for a way that maximizes each agent's total value from the items they receive, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the values:
- Agent 0 values items as [51, 69, 48, 48, 71]
- Agent 1 values items as [83, 11, 0, 45, 38]

Let's maximize the total valuation for each agent by assigning the items they value the most:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 83, while Agent 0 values it at 51. Assign to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 69, while Agent 1 values it at 11. Assign to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 48, while Agent 1 values it at 0. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 and Agent 1 value it equally at 48 and 45, respectively. Assign to Agent 0 for balance.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 71, while Agent 1 values it at 38. Assign to Agent 0.

Allocations considering balance:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 4]

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
