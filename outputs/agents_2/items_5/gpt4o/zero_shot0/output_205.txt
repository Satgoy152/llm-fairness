Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1  2   3   4
0  42  23  5  40  64
1  66  88  0  31  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations, we can use a method like the "maximum sum of valuations" approach. This method attempts to allocate items to the agents such that the total sum of valuations for each agent is maximized.

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**  
   - Item 0: 42
   - Item 1: 23
   - Item 2: 5
   - Item 3: 40
   - Item 4: 64

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:** 
   - Item 0: 66
   - Item 1: 88
   - Item 2: 0
   - Item 3: 31
   - Item 4: 48

Let's make an optimal allocation based on maximizing the total valuation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it higher (66 vs 42).
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it higher (88 vs 23).
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it higher (5 vs 0).
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it higher (40 vs 31).
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it higher (64 vs 48).

Based on these valuations, the allocation can be:

- **Agent 0:** Items 2, 3, and 4
- **Agent 1:** Items 0 and 1

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 109 (5 + 40 + 64) and Agent 1 a total valuation of 154 (66 + 88).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
