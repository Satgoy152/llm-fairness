Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  45  62  29   8
1  29  92  54  84  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[66 45 62 29  8]
 [29 92 54 84 96]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can maximize the total valuation each agent receives by assigning items to the agent who values them the most. This can be done by comparing each item's value for the two agents and allocating it to the agent with the higher valuation. Let's go through the items one by one:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 values it at 29. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 92. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 54. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 29, Agent 1 values it at 84. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 values it at 96. Allocate to Agent 1.

Based on these comparisons, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
