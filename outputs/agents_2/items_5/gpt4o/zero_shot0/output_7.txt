Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  54   4  40  93
1  85  10  60  87  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize their total valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: 
Item 0 = 10, Item 1 = 54, Item 2 = 4, Item 3 = 40, Item 4 = 93

Agent 1:
Item 0 = 85, Item 1 = 10, Item 2 = 60, Item 3 = 87, Item 4 = 49
```

To fairly distribute the items, we can use a strategy that attempts to balance the total values assigned to each agent. We can do this by considering the differences in valuations for each item and assigning items to the agent who values them the most, while keeping track of the overall distribution.

Let's consider the allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 10
   - Agent 1 values it at 85
   - Allocate to Agent 1

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 54
   - Agent 1 values it at 10
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 4
   - Agent 1 values it at 60
   - Allocate to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 40
   - Agent 1 values it at 87
   - Allocate to Agent 1

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 93
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Allocate to Agent 0

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 3]

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
