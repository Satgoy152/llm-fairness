Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   6  85   2   0  20
1  36  76  77  13  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent. We can use the strategy of maximizing the sum of values for each agent based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive if they were allocated each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: [6, 85, 2, 0, 20]
- Agent 1's valuations: [36, 76, 77, 13, 65]

We need to allocate these items such that the total value for each agent is maximized. We'll proceed by assigning items to the agent who values them the most.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 36, and Agent 0 values it at 6, so assign it to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 85, and Agent 1 values it at 76, so assign it to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 77, and Agent 0 values it at 2, so assign it to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 13, and Agent 0 values it at 0, so assign it to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 65, and Agent 0 values it at 20, so assign it to Agent 1.

After the allocation, the items are distributed as follows:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, 3, and 4.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
