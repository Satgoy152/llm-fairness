Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  6   3  83  18  57
1  1  45  78  66  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring an integer allocation of items. We'll use a simple approach where we try to maximize the happiness of each agent by allocating the items based on their valuations.

Let's take a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 6.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 1.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 because they have a higher valuation.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 3.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 45.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 because they have a higher valuation.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 83.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 78.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 because they have a higher valuation.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 18.
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 at 66.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 because they have a higher valuation.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 4 at 57.
   - Agent 1 values Item 4 at 50.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 because they have a higher valuation.

Now, we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their preferences for the items.
