Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  45  68  11  31
1  84  86  14   4  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will assign items in such a way that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. We can use a greedy approach to achieve this.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each agent if they received all the items:
- Agent 0: 24 + 45 + 68 + 11 + 31 = 179
- Agent 1: 84 + 86 + 14 + 4 + 80 = 268

Next, we consider the relative preference each agent has for the items and assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least two items since there are five items in total.

Let's evaluate and allocate items:

### Item 0
- Agent 0 values it at 24
- Agent 1 values it at 84
- Assign to Agent 1

### Item 1
- Agent 0 values it at 45
- Agent 1 values it at 86
- Assign to Agent 1

### Item 2
- Agent 0 values it at 68
- Agent 1 values it at 14
- Assign to Agent 0

### Item 3
- Agent 0 values it at 11
- Agent 1 values it at 4
- Assign to Agent 0

### Item 4
- Agent 0 values it at 31
- Agent 1 values it at 80
- Assign to Agent 1

Now, let's verify the allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items [2, 3] with a total valuation of 68 + 11 = 79
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1, 4] with a total valuation of 84 + 86 + 80 = 250

This allocation ensures that both agents receive two items each, and one agent receives three due to an odd number of items, while also maximizing the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
