Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  54  23   7  48
1  95   6  56  16  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 23  
- Item 1: 54  
- Item 2: 23  
- Item 3: 7  
- Item 4: 48  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 95  
- Item 1: 6  
- Item 2: 56  
- Item 3: 16  
- Item 4: 22  

A potential allocation strategy is to give each agent the items for which they have higher valuations, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

An efficient allocation can be:  
- Agent 0 receives items for which their valuation significantly exceeds Agent 1's valuation.
- Agent 1 receives items for which their valuation is significantly higher.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 95, much higher than Agent 0's 23. So, allocate item 0 to agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 54, which is much higher than Agent 1’s 6. So, allocate item 1 to agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 56, higher than Agent 0's 23. So, allocate item 2 to agent 1.
4. Item 3: Both agents have a low valuation for this item, but Agent 1 values it slightly higher. So, allocate item 3 to agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 48, higher than Agent 1’s 22. So, allocate item 4 to agent 0.

Based on this strategy, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation seeks to ensure that each agent receives items they value more significantly while balancing the overall distribution.
