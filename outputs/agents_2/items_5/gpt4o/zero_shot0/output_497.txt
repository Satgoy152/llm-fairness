Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  36  75   1  49
1  72   2  16  59   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. One approach to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 3.
   - Agent 1 values it at 72.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 36.
   - Agent 1 values it at 2.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 75.
   - Agent 1 values it at 16.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 1.
   - Agent 1 values it at 59.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 49.
   - Agent 1 values it at 7.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

Thus, the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
