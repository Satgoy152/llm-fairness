Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

   0   1   2   3   4
0  7  88  32  81  93
1  2  13  96  82  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the sum of values each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one way to approach this allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items.
2. Try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

Given the table:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 7       | 2       |
| 1    | 88      | 13      |
| 2    | 32      | 96      |
| 3    | 81      | 82      |
| 4    | 93      | 36      |

Total valuation for each agent:
- Agent 0: 7 + 88 + 32 + 81 + 93 = 301
- Agent 1: 2 + 13 + 96 + 82 + 36 = 229

Allocation strategy:
1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that both agents end up with an integer number of items.
2. If an item has equal valuation, assign it in such a way that balances the total number of items each agent receives.

The allocation can be done as follows:
- Agent 0 gets items 1, 3, and 4 (with values 88, 81, and 93 respectively) which maximizes their benefit.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2 (with values 2 and 96 respectively) which maximizes their benefit.

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
