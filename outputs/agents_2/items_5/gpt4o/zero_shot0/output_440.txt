Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  49   5  43  76
1  91  14  60   4  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 14 60  4 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the method of maximizing total utility while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations provided and decide on an allocation:

Valuations:
```
Agent 0: [21, 49, 5, 43, 76]
Agent 1: [91, 14, 60, 4, 36]
```

To maximize fairness, we'll look for an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because they value it more (91 vs. 21).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because they value it more (49 vs. 14).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because they value it more (60 vs. 5).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 because they value it more (43 vs. 4).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because they value it more (76 vs. 36).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items totaling the highest possible value according to their preferences. 

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
