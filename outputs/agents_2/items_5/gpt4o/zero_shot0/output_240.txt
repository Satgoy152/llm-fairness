Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  24  13  14   9  82
1  93  82  81  52  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [93 82 81 52 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation. Let's analyze and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (82).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (93).

Let's allocate these items first:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 3):

- For item 1: Agent 1 values it at 82, which is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation of 13, so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- For item 2: Agent 1 values it at 81, higher than Agent 0's valuation of 14, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- For item 3: Agent 1 values it at 52, higher than Agent 0's valuation of 9, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

The allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is based on maximizing each agent's valuation.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```
