Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  50  22  14   6
1  47  30  60  92  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the total value for both agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

We have two agents (0 and 1) and five items (0 through 4). Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [75, 50, 22, 14, 6]
- Agent 1's valuations: [47, 30, 60, 92, 48]

One approach is to compute the total value each agent would receive for different allocations and choose a fair distribution. A simple heuristic is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, and then adjust to ensure each agent gets at least two items.

Let's start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 75, and Agent 1 values it at 47. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 50, and Agent 1 values it at 30. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 22, and Agent 1 values it at 60. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 14, and Agent 1 values it at 92. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 6, and Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 1.

Initial allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 4]

Both agents have an integer number of items, and each agent receives at least two items.

The final allocation is fair given the initial valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
