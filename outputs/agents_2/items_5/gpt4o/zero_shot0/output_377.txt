Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  15   7  33  78
1   0  95  77  21  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 0 95 77 21 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 73, 15, 7, 33, 78
Agent 1: 0, 95, 77, 21, 61
```

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

One potential allocation is to assign the items to maximize each agent's total valuation:

- **Agent 0** values item 4 the highest (78), followed by item 0 (73).
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest (95), followed by item 2 (77).

Given these preferences, one fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 4 and item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 and item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, both agents receive items that maximize their perceived value, and the total number of items is fairly distributed.
