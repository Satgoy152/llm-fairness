Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  91  12  66  40
1  25  94  37  29  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common approach to solve such allocation problems is to use a method like the "greedy algorithm" where we assign items based on the highest valuation difference between the agents. Here's how we can proceed step-by-step:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.
3. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's calculate and assign the items accordingly:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 51, and agent 1 values it at 25. Assign to agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 91, and agent 1 values it at 94. Assign to agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 12, and agent 1 values it at 37. Assign to agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 66, and agent 1 values it at 29. Assign to agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 40, and agent 1 values it at 64. Assign to agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns items 0 and 3 to agent 0, and items 1, 2, and 4 to agent 1, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizing the total value for each agent based on their valuations.
