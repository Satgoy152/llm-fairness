Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87   5   4  76  15
1  68  99  15  86  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring an integer number of items is allocated to each.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
Agent 0: [87, 5, 4, 76, 15]
Agent 1: [68, 99, 15, 86, 87]
```

Let's analyze the possible allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 87.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 99.
- Agent 1 also values item 4 highly at 87.

Considering these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since they value it the highest.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since they value it the highest.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it highly at 76, and Agent 1 has already received an item they value highly.
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 because they value it highly at 87.
5. This leaves item 2, which can be allocated to Agent 1 since Agent 0 already has more higher-valued items.

Based on this reasoning, the allocations can be summarized as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on the given valuations, ensuring that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly.
