Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  70  31  68   4
1  96  19  54   3  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items. This will help us understand each agent's preferences.

   Agent 0:
   - Item 0: 54
   - Item 1: 70
   - Item 2: 31
   - Item 3: 68
   - Item 4: 4
   Total for Agent 0: 54 + 70 + 31 + 68 + 4 = 227

   Agent 1:
   - Item 0: 96
   - Item 1: 19
   - Item 2: 54
   - Item 3: 3
   - Item 4: 32
   Total for Agent 1: 96 + 19 + 54 + 3 + 32 = 204

2. Sort items by the difference in valuation between the two agents to find items where one agent has a significantly higher preference.

   Differences (Agent 1 valuation - Agent 0 valuation):
   - Item 0: 96 - 54 = 42
   - Item 1: 19 - 70 = -51
   - Item 2: 54 - 31 = 23
   - Item 3: 3 - 68 = -65
   - Item 4: 32 - 4 = 28

3. Allocate items to maximize satisfaction based on the sorted differences:

   - Item 3: Allocate to Agent 0 (Agent 0 prefers much more)
   - Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0 (Agent 0 prefers much more)
   - Item 4: Allocate to Agent 1 (Agent 1 prefers more)
   - Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1 (Agent 1 prefers more)
   - Item 2: Allocate to Agent 1 (remaining item)

This allocation gives Agent 0 two items they highly value and Agent 1 the remaining items where they have higher or moderate preference.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
