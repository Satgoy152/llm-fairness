Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  71  97  35   2
1  43  85  38  45  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for both agents. One way to approach this is to use a simple method like the "greedy algorithm," where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share based on the total number of items.

Here are the steps:

1. We have 5 items to allocate between 2 agents, so ideally each agent should get either 2 or 3 items.
2. For each item, check which agent values it more and assign the item to that agent, while balancing the total number of items each receives.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 43. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 71, Agent 1 values it at 85. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 38. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 35, Agent 1 values it at 45. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 values it at 18. Assign to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
