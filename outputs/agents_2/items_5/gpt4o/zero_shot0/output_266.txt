Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  96  5  99  27  10
1   9  0  13  44  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given valuations to determine an optimal allocation:

For Agent 0:
- Item 0: 96
- Item 1: 5
- Item 2: 99
- Item 3: 27
- Item 4: 10

For Agent 1:
- Item 0: 9
- Item 1: 0
- Item 2: 13
- Item 3: 44
- Item 4: 10

By comparing the valuations for each item, let's allocate the items to maximize the overall satisfaction:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item much higher (96) than Agent 1 (9). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item slightly higher (5) than Agent 1 (0). Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item significantly higher (99) than Agent 1 (13). Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this item higher (44) than Agent 0 (27). Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Both agents value this item equally (10), but since Agent 1 has only one item so far, allocate to Agent 1 to balance the distribution.

The allocation based on these considerations is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
