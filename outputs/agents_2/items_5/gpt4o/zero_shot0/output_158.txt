Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  83  23  24   5
1  98  60  76  89  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[79 83 23 24  5]
 [98 60 76 89 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the total value each agent places on the items and try to distribute them such that each agent receives a fair share of the total value.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [79, 83, 23, 24, 5]
Agent 1: [98, 60, 76, 89, 91]
```

First, let's sum up the total valuations for each agent:

- Total value for Agent 0: \(79 + 83 + 23 + 24 + 5 = 214\)
- Total value for Agent 1: \(98 + 60 + 76 + 89 + 91 = 414\)

Next, let's try to allocate the items to balance the total value each agent receives. One way is to start by allocating the items that have the highest difference in valuation between the agents to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it much higher (98 vs 79), so allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it slightly higher (83 vs 60), so allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it higher (76 vs 23), so allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it much higher (89 vs 24), so allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it much higher (91 vs 5), so allocate to Agent 1.

After this allocation:

- Agent 0: [1] with value \(83\)
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3, 4] with value \(98 + 76 + 89 + 91 = 354\)

To balance better, we can adjust:

- Reallocate item 1 to Agent 0 (as already done).
- Consider reallocating one item with less difference to Agent 0, such as item 2 or 3.

Another approach:

- Agent 0: [0, 1] with values \(79 + 83 = 162\)
- Agent 1: [2, 3, 4] with values \(76 + 89 + 91 = 256\)

Balancing this out gives a more equitable distribution. Therefore, the allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give a fair allocation based on the valuation differences and total values.
