Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  47  40  65  78
1  26  71  14  15  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 5 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive around half of the total valuation of the items.

First, let's calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(3 + 47 + 40 + 65 + 78 = 233\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(26 + 71 + 14 + 15 + 34 = 160\)

Next, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible, meaning each gets items with high individual valuations for them. Let's sort the items by the difference in valuations between the two agents:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (26 vs. 3)
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (71 vs. 47)
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (40 vs. 14)
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (65 vs. 15)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (78 vs. 34)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives Agent 0 three items and Agent 1 two items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.
