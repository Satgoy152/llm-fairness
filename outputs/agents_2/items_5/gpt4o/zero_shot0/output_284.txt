Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  61  32  70  51
1  39  11   7  50  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to maximize the total satisfaction for both agents. One common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is the product of the agents' utilities.

Let's evaluate the situation by considering each agent's preferences for the items:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 25
- Item 1: 61
- Item 2: 32
- Item 3: 70
- Item 4: 51

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 39
- Item 1: 11
- Item 2: 7
- Item 3: 50
- Item 4: 86

To achieve a fair allocation, we can perform the following steps:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as the value (70) is higher for agent 0 than for agent 1 (50).
2. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as the value (86) is higher for agent 1 than for agent 0 (51).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as the value (61) is higher for agent 0 than for agent 1 (11).
4. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as the value (39) is higher for agent 1 than for agent 0 (25).
5. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as the remaining item.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a set of items that maximizes their respective valuations to the greatest extent possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
