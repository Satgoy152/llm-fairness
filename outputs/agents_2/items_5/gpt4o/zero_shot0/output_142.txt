Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64   6  79  15  68
1  63  80  65  62  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 80 65 62 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction or value each agent receives.

Let's look at the valuations:
- Agent 0 values the items as: [64, 6, 79, 15, 68]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [63, 80, 65, 62, 46]

To ensure fairness, we can use a method like maximizing the total value received by both agents or attempting to equalize the value each agent receives.

One simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it more:

1. Item 0 has valuations 64 (Agent 0) and 63 (Agent 1). Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1 has valuations 6 (Agent 0) and 80 (Agent 1). Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2 has valuations 79 (Agent 0) and 65 (Agent 1). Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3 has valuations 15 (Agent 0) and 62 (Agent 1). Assign to Agent 1.
5. Item 4 has valuations 68 (Agent 0) and 46 (Agent 1). Assign to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
