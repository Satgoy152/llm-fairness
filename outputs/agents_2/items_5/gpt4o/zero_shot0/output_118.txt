Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  32  76  54  59
1  96   2  11  50  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We can use a greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 87, Agent 1 values at 96. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 32, Agent 1 values at 2. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 76, Agent 1 values at 11. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 54, Agent 1 values at 50. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values at 59, Agent 1 values at 67. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 4

The JSON format for the allocations is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
