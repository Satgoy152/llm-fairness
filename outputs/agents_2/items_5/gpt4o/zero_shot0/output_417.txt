Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  30  56  54  54
1  26   8  96  76  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach for such problems is to use a method that balances the total value received by each agent.

Let's approach the problem by considering each agent's valuations of the items and trying to distribute the items to balance the overall satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:**  
   - Item 0: 2
   - Item 1: 30
   - Item 2: 56
   - Item 3: 54
   - Item 4: 54

2. **Agent 1's valuations:**  
   - Item 0: 26
   - Item 1: 8
   - Item 2: 96
   - Item 3: 76
   - Item 4: 72

Let's allocate the items:

- **Allocate items based on the highest value preference for each agent:**
  - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 1, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
  - Item 3 is the next highest value for Agent 1, so allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
  - Item 4 is also highly valued by Agent 1, allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

- **Allocate the remaining items to Agent 0:**
  - Item 0 and Item 1 are available, allocate them to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that Agent 1 receives items with higher individual values according to their preference, while Agent 0 receives the remaining items.
