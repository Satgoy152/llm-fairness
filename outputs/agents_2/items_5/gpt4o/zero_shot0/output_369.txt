Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  19   9  15  79
1  90  42  32  24  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation from the items they receive. 

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items:

- Agent 0: 41 + 19 + 9 + 15 + 79 = 163
- Agent 1: 90 + 42 + 32 + 24 + 54 = 242

To fairly allocate the items, we should try to balance the total valuation each agent receives. A balanced allocation would be one where the valuation totals are as close as possible.

One potential allocation could be:

- Assign items 0, 3, and 4 to Agent 0: Value = 41 + 15 + 79 = 135
- Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 1: Value = 42 + 32 = 74

However, this allocation doesn't fairly balance the valuation totals. Let's try another allocation:

- Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 0: Value = 41 + 79 = 120
- Assign items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 1: Value = 42 + 32 + 24 = 98

This allocation is still not balanced. Let's try a different approach:

- Assign items 0, 2, and 3 to Agent 0: Value = 41 + 9 + 15 = 65
- Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 1: Value = 42 + 54 = 96

This allocation gives a closer balance in terms of the number of items assigned but not in valuation. Let's try:

- Assign items 0, 1, and 3 to Agent 0: Value = 41 + 19 + 15 = 75
- Assign items 2 and 4 to Agent 1: Value = 32 + 54 = 86

Continuing this process, the following allocation might be considered more balanced based on valuations:

- Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 1: Value = 90 + 54 = 144
- Assign items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 0: Value = 19 + 9 + 15 = 43

Ultimately, finding a perfectly fair allocation depends on the criteria. For a simple integer allocation with two agents, you might need to prioritize maximizing each agent's valuation subject to the total number of items.

Here's a final allocation suggestion:

- Assign items 0, 2, and 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 1 and 4 to Agent 1.

Based on maximizing the valuation for each agent as much as possible while keeping the allocation fair:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation balances the number of items between the agents and attempts to fairly distribute the valuations.
