Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  69  5  32  29  45
1  17  0  57  98  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we allocate items to the agent who values them the most until each item is allocated.

Let's evaluate the best allocation:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 69.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 17.
   - **Allocate item 0 to agent 0.**

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 5.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 0.
   - **Allocate item 1 to agent 0.**

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 32.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 57.
   - **Allocate item 2 to agent 1.**

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 29.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 98.
   - **Allocate item 3 to agent 1.**

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values item 4 at 45.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 at 37.
   - **Allocate item 4 to agent 0.**

### Final Allocation:

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations of the items.
