Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  23   1  32  35
1  62  74  90   7  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize fairness based on the agents' valuations of the items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** Sum up the valuations for each agent to understand their overall preferences.

   Agent 0 total valuation: 11 + 23 + 1 + 32 + 35 = 102  
   Agent 1 total valuation: 62 + 74 + 90 + 7 + 87 = 320

2. **Determine Fair Allocation:** We aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is proportional to their overall valuations.

3. **Initial Allocation:** Assign items to agents starting with the highest individual valuations until all items are allocated.

4. **Adjust for Fairness:** Ensure that each agent's total allocation is as fair as possible based on their initial total valuations.

Using this approach, here is a fair allocation of the items:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 3, 4]
  - Item 0: 11, Item 3: 32, Item 4: 35
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 11 + 32 + 35 = 78

- **Agent 1**: [1, 2]
  - Item 1: 74, Item 2: 90
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 74 + 90 = 164

This allocation tries to balance the valuation each agent receives relative to their total preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
