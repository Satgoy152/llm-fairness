Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  67  21  17  25
1  54  42  58  13  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [54 42 58 13 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's look at the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 85
- Item 1: 67
- Item 2: 21
- Item 3: 17
- Item 4: 25

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 54
- Item 1: 42
- Item 2: 58
- Item 3: 13
- Item 4: 66

We have 5 items to allocate between 2 agents, and each agent should receive an integer number of items. Let's try to allocate them in a way that maximizes fairness.

1. **Assign Items Based on Highest Individual Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 the most (85), so let's allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 4 the most (66), so let's allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

2. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Now we have Items 1, 2, and 3 left.
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 significantly (67), so let's allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 significantly (58), so let's allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Finally, Item 3, which has relatively low value for both agents, can be allocated to Agent 0 (since Agent 1 already has 2 items, and this balances the number of items).

3. **Re-evaluate for Balance in Terms of Value:**

   After the above allocations, check the value distribution:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 3 → 85 + 67 + 17 = 169
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 4 → 58 + 66 = 124

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their highest valuations while keeping the number of items balanced.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
