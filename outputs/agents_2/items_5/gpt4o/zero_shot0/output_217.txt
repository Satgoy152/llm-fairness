Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12  45  43  98  39
1  40  44   4   0  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to balance out the total valuations each agent receives. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

   - Agent 0: 12 + 45 + 43 + 98 + 39 = 237
   - Agent 1: 40 + 44 + 4 + 0 + 15 = 103

2. To fairly distribute the items, we can aim to give each agent a proportion of items that reflects their total valuation.

3. Distribute items based on maximizing each agent's value:

   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most, followed by items 2, 1, 4, and 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most, followed by items 0, 4, 2, and 3.

4. Allocate items:
   - Give Agent 0 the highest valued items they prefer.
   - Give Agent 1 the highest valued items they prefer.

A possible allocation could be:
- Agent 0: items 3, 2
- Agent 1: items 1, 0, 4

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 141 (98 + 43) and Agent 1 a total value of 99 (44 + 40 + 15).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1, 0, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations.
