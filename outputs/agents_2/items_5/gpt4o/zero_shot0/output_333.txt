Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  15  44  68  40
1  24  74  32  90  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple algorithm like the "Greedy Allocation" approach. This involves assigning each item one by one to the agent who values it the most until all items have been allocated. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 25.
   - Agent 1 values it at 24.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 15.
   - Agent 1 values it at 74.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 44.
   - Agent 1 values it at 32.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 68.
   - Agent 1 values it at 90.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 40.
   - Agent 1 values it at 87.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

Following this approach, the allocations will be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

Here, Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 4.
