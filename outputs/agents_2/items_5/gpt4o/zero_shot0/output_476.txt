Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  48  30  62   5
1  79  56  70  81  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [79 56 70 81 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. We will assign each item to the agent that values it the most.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 values it at 79.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 48, Agent 1 values it at 56.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 values it at 70.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 81.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 values it at 27.

Allocating each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Allocated to Agent 0 (93 > 79)
- Item 1: Allocated to Agent 1 (56 > 48)
- Item 2: Allocated to Agent 1 (70 > 30)
- Item 3: Allocated to Agent 1 (81 > 62)
- Item 4: Allocated to Agent 1 (27 > 5)

This allocation gives:

Agent 0 gets item: 0

Agent 1 gets items: 1, 2, 3, 4

The resulting allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
