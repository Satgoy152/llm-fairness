Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  84  37  88  20
1  37  17  47  70  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. **Initial Analysis**: Evaluate which items have the highest value for each agent.
2. **Allocation Strategy**: Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's assess the value each agent assigns to the items:

- **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 3: 88
  - Item 4: 20
  
- **Agent 1's Valuations**: 
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 70
  - Item 4: 49

To maximize fairness, we will allocate the items based on the relative valuation of each item by the agents. Let's proceed to allocate the items:

1. **Item 3**: Highest value for Agent 0 (88) versus Agent 1 (70). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Higher value for Agent 0 (84) versus Agent 1 (17). Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 4**: Higher value for Agent 1 (49) versus Agent 0 (20). Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 2**: Higher value for Agent 1 (47) versus Agent 0 (37). Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 0**: Higher value for Agent 0 (49) versus Agent 1 (37). Allocate to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 4

Let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the distribution is based on maximizing each agent's total valuation.
