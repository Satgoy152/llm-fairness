Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  14  70   4  86
1  78  21  43  97  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [78 21 43 97 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize their total satisfaction or value. One approach is to use a maximum weighted matching or similar method to assign items optimally based on the agents' valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [61, 14, 70, 4, 86]
Agent 1: [78, 21, 43, 97, 11]
```

We can assign the items as follows:

1. **Item 3** has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (97) compared to Agent 0 (4), so assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 4** has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (86) compared to Agent 1 (11), so assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 0** has a higher valuation for Agent 1 (78) compared to Agent 0 (61), so assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 2** has a higher valuation for Agent 0 (70) compared to Agent 1 (43), so assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 1** has a higher valuation for Agent 1 (21) compared to Agent 0 (14), so assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation seeks to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
