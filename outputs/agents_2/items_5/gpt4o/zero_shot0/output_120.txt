Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  59  74  17  32  49
1  68   8  11  80  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 32
  - Item 4: 49

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 68
  - Item 1: 8
  - Item 2: 11
  - Item 3: 80
  - Item 4: 34

We can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items that have higher values for them compared to Agent 1.
- Agent 1 receives items that have higher values for them compared to Agent 0.

Based on the valuations, a fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4]
  - Total value: 59 (Item 0) + 74 (Item 1) + 49 (Item 4) = 182

- Agent 1: Items [2, 3]
  - Total value: 11 (Item 2) + 80 (Item 3) = 91

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the distribution is fairly balanced given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
