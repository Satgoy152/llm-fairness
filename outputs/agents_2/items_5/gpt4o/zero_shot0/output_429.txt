Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  22  38  57  35  29
1  31   2  55  31  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [31  2 55 31 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing each agent's total valuation by assigning items based on their preferences. One way to achieve this is through a greedy algorithm, which assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring an integer allocation for each agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [22, 38, 57, 35, 29]
- Agent 1: [31, 2, 55, 31, 80]

Let's allocate each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 31, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 22. Assign to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 38, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 2. Assign to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 57, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 55. Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 35, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 31. Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 80, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 29. Assign to Agent 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences and the constraints provided.
