Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  47  54  77  57
1  17  30  63  62  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we want to ensure that each agent receives items such that their total valuation is maximized given the constraints. A common approach is to use a "greedy" method that ensures each item goes to the agent who values it the most, but since we also need to make sure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we may need to adjust the simple greedy allocation to ensure fairness and completeness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Assign items based on highest value:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 77, and Agent 1 values it at 17. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 47, and Agent 1 values it at 30. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 54, and Agent 1 values it at 63. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Both agents value it equally at 77 and 62. Assign to Agent 0 (arbitrarily resolving ties).
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 57, and Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 0.

After this initial allocation, Agent 0 will receive items [0, 1, 3, 4] and Agent 1 will receive item [2]. However, Agent 1 only has one item, so we'll need to adjust to ensure both agents get a fair share.

2. **Adjust to ensure fair distribution:**
   - Swap the item that Agent 0 values least with an item Agent 1 values more, if possible.
   - Swap Item 1 (value 47 for Agent 0) with Item 3 (value 62 for Agent 1).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 4]
- Agent 1: [2, 3]

Now both agents have two items each.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
