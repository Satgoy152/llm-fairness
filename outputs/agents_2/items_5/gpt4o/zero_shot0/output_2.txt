Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  72  22  89  84
1  90  24  31  59  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm that allocates items based on the highest value for each agent. Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 26  
- Item 1: 72  
- Item 2: 22  
- Item 3: 89  
- Item 4: 84  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 90  
- Item 1: 24  
- Item 2: 31  
- Item 3: 59  
- Item 4: 25  

Now, let's perform the allocation step by step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 90, while Agent 0 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 72, while Agent 1 values it at 24. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 31, while Agent 0 values it at 22. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 89, while Agent 1 values it at 59. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 84, while Agent 1 values it at 25. Allocate to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.

Let's present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
