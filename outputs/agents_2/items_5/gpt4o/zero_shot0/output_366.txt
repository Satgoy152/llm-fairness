Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  55  75  24  55
1  62  36  77   1   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [62 36 77  1  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Let's evaluate the valuation matrix:

```
    Items
    0   1   2   3   4
0  32  55  75  24  55
1  62  36  77   1   1
```

For each item, we'll assign it to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 62, more than Agent 0 who values it at 32.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 55, more than Agent 1 who values it at 36.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 77, more than Agent 0 who values it at 75.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 24, more than Agent 1 who values it at 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 55, more than Agent 1 who values it at 1.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 4  
Agent 1: Items 0, 2

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
