Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  34  88  13  67
1  70   5  75  53  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items one by one based on the highest value difference between the agents, or to maximize total value per agent given the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process based on maximizing individual agent values:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 values it at 70.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 5.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 values it at 75.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 13, Agent 1 values it at 53.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 values it at 13.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

After these allocations, Agent 0 receives four items, and Agent 1 receives one. However, to better balance the number of items, we may consider switching items while keeping a relatively fair distribution of values:

Let's adjust the allocation for better balance:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]

This way, each agent receives an integer number of items while trying to respect their valuation preferences.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
