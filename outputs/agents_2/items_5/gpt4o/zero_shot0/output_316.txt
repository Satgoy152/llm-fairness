Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  61  33  56  54
1  52   6  33  51  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. 

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items and then allocate the items in a way that tries to balance the total valuation received by each agent.

### Step 1: List the values each agent assigns to each item.
- Agent 0's valuations: [95, 61, 33, 56, 54]
- Agent 1's valuations: [52, 6, 33, 51, 40]

### Step 2: Calculate the sum of valuations for all items for each agent.
- Total valuation for Agent 0: 95 + 61 + 33 + 56 + 54 = 299
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 52 + 6 + 33 + 51 + 40 = 182

### Step 3: Allocate items to maximize fairness.
To achieve a fair allocation, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a similar proportion of their total valuation.

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 0 significantly higher (95) compared to Agent 1 (52).

2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has a much higher valuation (61) compared to Agent 1 (6).

3. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Both agents value this item equally (33), but giving it to Agent 1 balances the allocations better since Agent 0 already got the higher valued items.

4. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values this item (51) close to Agent 0 (56). Giving it to Agent 1 helps balance the total valuations.

5. **Allocate item 4 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values this item relatively well (40) compared to Agent 0 (54), and it further balances the total allocations.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3, 4

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
