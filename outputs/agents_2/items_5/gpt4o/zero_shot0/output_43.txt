Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  76  60  47  96
1  85  55  62  89  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and strive for an allocation that balances these valuations. One common method for achieving this is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" approach, where each agent is assigned the items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that each item is allocated to one agent.

Given the valuations table:

Agent 0:  
- Item 0: 64
- Item 1: 76
- Item 2: 60
- Item 3: 47
- Item 4: 96

Agent 1:  
- Item 0: 85
- Item 1: 55
- Item 2: 62
- Item 3: 89
- Item 4: 33

Let's look for a solution that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation and choose the allocation that balances the values for each agent.

2. A simple approach is to initially assign items based on the highest valuation for each item. Let's assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (85 > 64)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (76 > 55)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (62 > 60)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (89 > 47)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (96 > 33)

After this initial assignment, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0 has items: 1, 4
- Agent 1 has items: 0, 2, 3

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 76 (for item 1) + 96 (for item 4) = 172
- Agent 1 total valuation: 85 (for item 0) + 62 (for item 2) + 89 (for item 3) = 236

To balance it more evenly, we need to consider swapping items to improve fairness. A potential swap is item 2 from Agent 1 to Agent 0.

After the swap:

- Agent 0 has items: 1, 2, 4
- Agent 1 has items: 0, 3

Recalculate the valuations:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 76 (for item 1) + 60 (for item 2) + 96 (for item 4) = 232
- Agent 1 total valuation: 85 (for item 0) + 89 (for item 3) = 174

This allocation is more balanced. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
