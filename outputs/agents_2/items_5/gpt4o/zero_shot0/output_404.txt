Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  36  66  81  91
1   1  44  54  12  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 1 44 54 12 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation combination.
2. Assign items in a way that balances the valuation across the agents as fairly as possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: 73, 36, 66, 81, 91
Agent 1:  1, 44, 54, 12, 12
```

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize fairness while ensuring each agent receives integer numbers of items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest, so assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 0 also values item 4 highly, so assign item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest, so assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 3 highly, so assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 to balance the remaining items.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2

In JSON format, the allocation would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation is designed to maximize the total valuation for each agent while distributing the items as fairly as possible based on their preferences.
