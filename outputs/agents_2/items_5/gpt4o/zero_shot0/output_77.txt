Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  94  86  73  65
1  28  44  18  20  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item by each agent.
2. Use a method like the "maximum sum allocation" to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing their individual satisfaction.

The valuation table is as follows:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
| 0    | 97      | 28      |
| 1    | 94      | 44      |
| 2    | 86      | 18      |
| 3    | 73      | 20      |
| 4    | 65      | 97      |

To allocate the items fairly, we can follow a process like this:

- Agent 0 has a higher valuation for items 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 has a significantly higher valuation for item 4.

A fair allocation based on these valuations could be:

- Assign items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives Agent 0 a higher total valuation with items 0, 1, and 2, while Agent 1 gets a high-valuation item 4 and a lower-valuation item 3. This distribution ensures both agents receive valuable items according to their preferences.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
