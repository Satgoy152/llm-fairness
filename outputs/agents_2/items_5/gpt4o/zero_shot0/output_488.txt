Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  35  28  14  52
1  39  92  25  21  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's use a greedy approach to assign items based on the highest value an agent places on them:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 78, and Agent 1 values it at 39. Assign it to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 35, and Agent 1 values it at 92. Assign it to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 28, and Agent 1 values it at 25. Assign it to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 14, and Agent 1 values it at 21. Assign it to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 52, and Agent 1 values it at 88. Assign it to Agent 1.

Based on these assignments, we have the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and each item is assigned to the agent who values it more.
