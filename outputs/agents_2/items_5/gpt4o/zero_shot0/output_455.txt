Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  75  36  35  90
1  29  77  73  45  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use a method called "envy-free allocation," where each agent receives items such that they value their allocation as much as possible without envying the other agent's allocation. Given the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations: [64, 75, 36, 35, 90]  
Agent 1's valuations: [29, 77, 73, 45, 15]

One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items allocated to them. We can try to balance the perceived value each agent receives by attempting to allocate based on maximizing each agent's total perceived value.

Let's try to allocate the items step by step:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4 (value 90), while Agent 1 values it least (value 15). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (value 73), while Agent 0 values it less (value 36). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. Agent 0 highly values item 1 (value 75), while Agent 1 values it equally (value 77). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0's next highest preference.

4. Agent 1 highly values item 3 (value 45), while Agent 0 values it least (value 35). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

5. The remaining item is item 0. Agent 0 values it at 64, while Agent 1 values it at 29. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Following this allocation strategy, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation provides Agent 0 with a total value of 229 (64 + 75 + 90) and Agent 1 with a total value of 118 (73 + 45), which maximizes the total satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations.
