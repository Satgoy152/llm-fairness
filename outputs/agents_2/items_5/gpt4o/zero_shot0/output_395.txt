Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  43  94  20   5
1  25  35  27  20  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and determine a fair allocation:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 26
- Item 1: 43
- Item 2: 94
- Item 3: 20
- Item 4: 5

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 25
- Item 1: 35
- Item 2: 27
- Item 3: 20
- Item 4: 53

We can try to allocate items to maximize the perceived value for each agent. Let's distribute them as follows:

1. Agent 0 should get item 2 because it has the highest value for them (94).
2. Agent 1 should get item 4 because it has the highest value for them (53).
3. To balance the remaining items, we will evaluate the total value each agent would get with the remaining items and ensure a fair distribution.

By looking at the remaining items:
- Agent 0 values items 0, 1, and 3 as 26, 43, and 20, respectively.
- Agent 1 values items 0, 1, and 3 as 25, 35, and 20, respectively.

Let's allocate:
- Item 1 to Agent 0 (since 43 is higher than 35 for Agent 1).
- Item 0 to Agent 1 (since 25 is close to 26, and Agent 1 already has a high-value item).
- Item 3 can be given to either. We'll give it to Agent 0 to balance the total value, as Agent 0 currently has a higher-value item (94 from item 2).

This allocation attempts to balance perceived value between the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their perceived value based on the given valuations.
