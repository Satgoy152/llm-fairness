Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  71  13  50  17
1  35  72  78  43  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **List the Items with Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's valuations: [97, 71, 13, 50, 17]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [35, 72, 78, 43, 90]

2. **Calculate Total Value for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: 97 (Agent 0) + 35 (Agent 1) = 132
   - Item 1: 71 (Agent 0) + 72 (Agent 1) = 143
   - Item 2: 13 (Agent 0) + 78 (Agent 1) = 91
   - Item 3: 50 (Agent 0) + 43 (Agent 1) = 93
   - Item 4: 17 (Agent 0) + 90 (Agent 1) = 107

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - To maximize fairness, we can use a method similar to maximizing the Nash welfare, which aims to equalize the products of utilities received by each agent.
   - Start by looking at the items with the highest valuations for each agent and try to balance their total valuation.

4. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate items based on a balance between total value and individual preferences:
     - Agent 0: Items 0, 1
     - Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 4

5. **Check Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 97 (Item 0) + 71 (Item 1) = 168
   - Agent 1: 78 (Item 2) + 43 (Item 3) + 90 (Item 4) = 211

6. **Adjust Allocation for Fairness:**
   - Swap Item 1 and Item 4 between the agents to balance valuations more fairly:
     - Agent 0: Items 0, 4
     - Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 3

7. **Re-check Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 97 (Item 0) + 17 (Item 4) = 114
   - Agent 1: 72 (Item 1) + 78 (Item 2) + 43 (Item 3) = 193

This allocation is more balanced, considering the total value each agent receives is as close as possible given the constraints.

**Final Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total valuation of the items.
