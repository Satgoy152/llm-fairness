Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  50  91  33  65
1  60  95  90  45  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [60 95 90 45 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we need to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent based on the given valuation table. This problem is a typical example of an assignment problem that can be solved using optimization techniques such as the Hungarian algorithm or simply by inspection due to the small size.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [70, 50, 91, 33, 65]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [60, 95, 90, 45, 29]

Our goal is to allocate these items to maximize each agent's satisfaction, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

By inspection, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 as they value it the highest (91 compared to 90 by Agent 1).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 as they value it the highest (95 compared to 50 by Agent 0).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 as they value it higher (70 compared to 60 by Agent 1).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as they value it higher (45 compared to 33 by Agent 0).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as they value it higher (65 compared to 29 by Agent 1).

This allocation ensures both agents get an integer number of items and aims to maximize their satisfaction based on their individual valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
