Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  63  37   8  63
1  37  78  48  91  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent. Here is a possible allocation that ensures fairness based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0's valuations:  
   - Item 0: 28  
   - Item 1: 63  
   - Item 2: 37  
   - Item 3: 8  
   - Item 4: 63  

2. Agent 1's valuations:  
   - Item 0: 37  
   - Item 1: 78  
   - Item 2: 48  
   - Item 3: 91  
   - Item 4: 88  

To maximize fairness, we'll try to distribute the items so that each agent gets the items they value the most, while also ensuring each agent gets a balanced number of items, which is 2 to 3 items per agent since there are 5 items.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, 4.  
- Agent 1 gets items 2, 3.

This allocation tries to balance both the total valuation for each agent and the number of items each agent receives.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
