Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  24  69  68   0
1  12  51  45  22  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach that maximizes the total value for each agent given their valuations. One of the methods to achieve this is to use the "maximum sum of allocations" principle while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here are the steps involved in this allocation:

1. **List each agent's valuations for the items:**

   - Agent 0: [65, 24, 69, 68, 0]
   - Agent 1: [12, 51, 45, 22, 22]

2. **Allocate the items based on the highest individual valuations for each item:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 values it at 12. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 values it at 51. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 values it at 45. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 values it at 22. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 values it at 22. Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items; in this case, each agent receives at least two items.**

Based on the above analysis, the allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent without any conflicts is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3, while Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4. This allocation respects the agents' valuations and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.
