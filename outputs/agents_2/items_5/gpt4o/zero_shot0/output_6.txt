Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  16  86  85   9
1  31  63  70  25  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their satisfaction while keeping the distribution fair. Let's examine the valuations and decide the allocation based on maximizing total value for each agent:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 31
- Item 1: 16
- Item 2: 86
- Item 3: 85
- Item 4: 9

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 31
- Item 1: 63
- Item 2: 70
- Item 3: 25
- Item 4: 25

Let's calculate the total value each agent gets if they receive certain items:

1. Agent 0 values Item 2 and Item 3 the highest (86 and 85, respectively). Giving these two items to Agent 0 maximizes their value.
2. Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (63), followed by Item 2 (70). However, since we are giving Item 2 to Agent 0, we should prioritize giving Agent 1 items that maximize their value, starting with Item 1.
3. Items 0 and 4 can be allocated in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

Considering the above analysis, we can allocate the items as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 4

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
