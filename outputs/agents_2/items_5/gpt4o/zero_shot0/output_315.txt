Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  26  36  89  11
1  45  33   5  98  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's overall satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's first calculate the total valuation for each item by both agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 45.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 33.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 5.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 values it at 98.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 11, Agent 1 values it at 29.

To determine the allocation, we can compare the valuations for each item and allocate the item to the agent who values it more, ensuring a fair distribution in terms of the total number of items each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 (58) > Agent 1 (45) -> Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 1: Agent 1 (33) > Agent 0 (26) -> Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 2: Agent 0 (36) > Agent 1 (5)  -> Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 3: Agent 1 (98) > Agent 0 (89) -> Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 4: Agent 1 (29) > Agent 0 (11) -> Allocate to Agent 1

This allocation results in Agent 0 receiving 2 items and Agent 1 receiving 3 items. Both agents receive an integer number of items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
