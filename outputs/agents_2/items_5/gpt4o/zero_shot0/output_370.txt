Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  61  28  56  68
1  73   3   7  65  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one way to proceed:

1. **List the items with their valuations for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 valuations: [0, 61, 28, 56, 68]
   - Agent 1 valuations: [73, 3, 7, 65, 36]

2. **Determine the total valuation each agent has for all items:**
   - Agent 0 total valuation: 0 + 61 + 28 + 56 + 68 = 213
   - Agent 1 total valuation: 73 + 3 + 7 + 65 + 36 = 184

3. **Allocate items by maximizing each agent's total valuation:**
   - Consider each item and allocate it to the agent who values it more or in a way that balances the overall satisfaction.

4. **Make an allocation decision based on the valuations:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (73 vs. 0)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (61 vs. 3)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (28 vs. 7)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (65 vs. 56)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (68 vs. 36)

5. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 3]

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
