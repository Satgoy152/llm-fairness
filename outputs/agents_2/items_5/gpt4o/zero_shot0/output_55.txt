Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  62  63  24  18
1  22   0  97  22  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [22  0 97 22 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items accordingly.

Here is the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  62  63  24  18
1  22   0  97  22  32
```

1. **Agent 0** has higher valuations for items 0, 1, 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a significantly higher valuation for item 2, but since agent 0 values it too, we have to balance other items.

Let's maximize the overall satisfaction:

- Agent 1 has a very high value for item 2 compared to agent 0 (97 vs 63). It would be fair to allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 has higher valuations for items 0 and 1 compared to Agent 1.
- For items 3 and 4, Agent 1's valuations are higher than Agent 0's.

Based on these observations, the allocation can be as follows:

- **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 1, which they value more.
- **Agent 1** gets items 2, 3, and 4, where they have higher combined valuations, especially for item 2.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation is based on maximizing the valuations each agent receives, given their preferences for the items.
