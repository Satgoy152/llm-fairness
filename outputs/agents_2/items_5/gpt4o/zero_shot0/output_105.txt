Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19  52  81  36  67
1  36  19  17  44  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** 
   - For Agent 0, the total value of all items is 19 + 52 + 81 + 36 + 67 = 255.
   - For Agent 1, the total value of all items is 36 + 19 + 17 + 44 + 54 = 170.

2. **Consider Item-by-Item Allocation:**
   - **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 19, and Agent 1 values it at 36. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 52, and Agent 1 values it at 19. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 81, and Agent 1 values it at 17. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 36, and Agent 1 values it at 44. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 67, and Agent 1 values it at 54. Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Verify Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [1, 2, 4], with total value 52 + 81 + 67 = 200.
   - Agent 1 gets items [0, 3], with total value 36 + 44 = 80.

This allocation ensures both agents get some items and maximizes their valuations based on the given preferences.

Final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
