Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  58   0  35  21
1  21  20  47  91  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the method of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated to one agent only. This can be approached in various ways, such as using a greedy algorithm or solving it as an optimization problem. Here, I'll use a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items.

1. First, let's create a matrix of the given values:
   ```
   Agent 0: [84, 58,  0, 35, 21]
   Agent 1: [21, 20, 47, 91, 61]
   ```

2. For each item, we will assign it to the agent who values it the most. This is a greedy approach and ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it more.

3. By comparing the values for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (84 vs 21)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (58 vs 20)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (0 vs 47)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (35 vs 91)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (21 vs 61)

4. After these comparisons, we allocate the items as follows:
   - Agent 0 gets items [0, 1]
   - Agent 1 gets items [2, 3, 4]

5. Present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items in a way that maximizes their total perceived value based on the given valuations.
