Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  21  93  39  36
1  13  60  38  23  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use the "maximum marginal gain" strategy, where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate accordingly:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 has a valuation of 77, while Agent 1 has a valuation of 13. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 has a valuation of 21, while Agent 1 has a valuation of 60. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 has a valuation of 93, while Agent 1 has a valuation of 38. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 has a valuation of 39, while Agent 1 has a valuation of 23. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 has a valuation of 36, while Agent 1 has a valuation of 42. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each item goes to the agent who values it most, maximizing the total value received by each agent. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items [0, 2, 3] and Agent 1 the items [1, 4].
