Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64   9  88   2  36
1  15  24  34  74  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - Item 0: 64
   - Item 1: 9
   - Item 2: 88
   - Item 3: 2
   - Item 4: 36

2. **Agent 1** values:
   - Item 0: 15
   - Item 1: 24
   - Item 2: 34
   - Item 3: 74
   - Item 4: 23

Let's allocate the items to maximize total satisfaction:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it more (64 vs. 15).
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it more (24 vs. 9).
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it more (88 vs. 34).
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it more (74 vs. 2).
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it more (36 vs. 23).

Allocation based on maximizing value for each item:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2, and 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes the individual valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
