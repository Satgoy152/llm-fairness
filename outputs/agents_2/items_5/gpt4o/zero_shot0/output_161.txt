Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  92  42  34  91
1  83  54  47  39  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation of the items each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 5 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally get around 2 or 3 items.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring both get a fair share in terms of the number of items.

Let's compute the total valuations first:

- Agent 0: 53 + 92 + 42 + 34 + 91 = 312
- Agent 1: 83 + 54 + 47 + 39 + 50 = 273

Now, we will allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (92), so we can initially allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (83), so we can allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Next, allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (valued at 91 by Agent 0).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 47 by Agent 1).
- Finally, allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (valued at 39 by Agent 1).

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items (Agent 0 gets 2 items, and Agent 1 gets 3 items), and it attempts to maximize the valuation each agent receives.
