Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  21  23   3  67  24
1  51  20  86  30   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common method for such a problem is a greedy allocation that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives a fair number of items.

Given there are 5 items and 2 agents, each agent should receive approximately half of the items. In this case, one agent could receive 3 items and the other 2. Let's proceed with a simple greedy allocation:

1. Evaluate each item to determine which agent values it more.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the higher value until each agent has received a fair number of items.

Here's the allocation process:

- For item 0: Agent 1 values it at 51, Agent 0 at 21. Allocate to Agent 1.
- For item 1: Agent 0 values it at 23, Agent 1 at 20. Allocate to Agent 0.
- For item 2: Agent 1 values it at 86, Agent 0 at 3. Allocate to Agent 1.
- For item 3: Agent 0 values it at 67, Agent 1 at 30. Allocate to Agent 0.
- For item 4: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 at 7. Allocate to Agent 0.

After allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
