Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  19  61  93  16
1   0  29  80  11  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 29 80 11 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  19  61  93  16
1   0  29  80  11  12
```

Let's analyze the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (93)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 0 (90)
   - Third highest valuation: Item 2 (61)
   - Fourth highest valuation: Item 1 (19)
   - Fifth highest valuation: Item 4 (16)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (80)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 1 (29)
   - Third highest valuation: Item 4 (12)
   - Fourth highest valuation: Item 3 (11)
   - Fifth highest valuation: Item 0 (0)

To allocate fairly, we should look at the items each agent values highly and assign based on maximizing individual satisfaction:

- **Allocate Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 values it at 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Allocate Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 values it at 29. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Allocate Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 80. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Allocate Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 values it at 11. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Allocate Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 16, Agent 1 values it at 12. Allocate to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
