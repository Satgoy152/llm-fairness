Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  25  68  68  19
1  32  51  74  52  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. We will aim to maximize the total utility for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: 81, 25, 68, 68, 19
- Agent 1: 32, 51, 74, 52, 41

A possible fair allocation is as follows:

1. Agent 0 receives items that maximize their total value.
2. Agent 1 receives the remaining items.

Let's calculate:

### Total Valuation for Each Item
- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 values it at 32.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 values it at 51.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 values it at 74.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 68, Agent 1 values it at 52.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 values it at 41.

### Allocation Strategy
- Assign items to the agent who values them more, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Allocating Items
1. Agent 0:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it higher (81 vs. 32).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it higher (68 vs. 52).
2. Agent 1:
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher (51 vs. 25).
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it higher (74 vs. 68).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (41 vs. 19).

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation respects the preferences of each agent to the best extent possible given the constraint of integer allocations.
