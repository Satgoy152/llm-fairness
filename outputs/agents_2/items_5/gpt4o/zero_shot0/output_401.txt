Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  95  16  78  11
1  16  55  55  99  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve this:

Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
- Item 0: 36  
- Item 1: 95  
- Item 2: 16  
- Item 3: 78  
- Item 4: 11  

Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
- Item 0: 16  
- Item 1: 55  
- Item 2: 55  
- Item 3: 99  
- Item 4: 16  

First, let's pair items with agents who value them the most:  
- Item 0: Agent 0 (36 > 16)  
- Item 1: Agent 0 (95 > 55)  
- Item 2: Agent 1 (55 > 16)  
- Item 3: Agent 1 (99 > 78)  
- Item 4: Agent 0 (11 > 16)  

Based on this pairing, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their perceived value. Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 4, while Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.
