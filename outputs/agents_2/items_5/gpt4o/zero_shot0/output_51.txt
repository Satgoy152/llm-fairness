Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  99  24  73  31
1   2  73  37   9  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim to distribute the items so that the perceived value is as even as possible between the agents. Let's first analyze the total value each agent places on all items:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 33  
- Item 1: 99  
- Item 2: 24  
- Item 3: 73  
- Item 4: 31  
Total = 33 + 99 + 24 + 73 + 31 = 260  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 2  
- Item 1: 73  
- Item 2: 37  
- Item 3: 9  
- Item 4: 79  
Total = 2 + 73 + 37 + 9 + 79 = 200  

Now, we try to allocate items such that the total perceived value by each agent is as balanced as possible. 

One possible fair allocation is:

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value to Agent 0)
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value to Agent 1)
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1

Now let's calculate the values:

Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, and 3:  
- Total value = 33 (item 0) + 99 (item 1) + 73 (item 3) = 205  

Agent 1 gets items 2 and 4:  
- Total value = 37 (item 2) + 79 (item 4) = 116  

Though this allocation isn't perfectly equal, it's a reasonable split given the differences in valuation.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value between the agents as fairly as possible given their valuations.
