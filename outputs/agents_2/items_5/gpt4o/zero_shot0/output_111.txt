Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  21  38  25  40
1  96  49  45  63  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple method that seeks to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. One way to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm that prioritizes items that provide the highest value to each agent.

Here's how we can do it:

1. Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.
3. Ensure that each agent gets exactly 2 or 3 items to maintain fairness in the number of items.

Let's apply this method to the given table:

| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 | Difference (Agent 1 - Agent 0) |
|------|---------|---------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 15      | 96      | 81                             |
| 1    | 21      | 49      | 28                             |
| 2    | 38      | 45      | 7                              |
| 3    | 25      | 63      | 38                             |
| 4    | 40      | 53      | 13                             |

Now, allocate items based on the largest difference:

- Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 3: Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 1: Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 4: Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 2: Allocate to Agent 0

This allocation gives each agent two items, balancing the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 1

Now let's present the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 1]
}
```
