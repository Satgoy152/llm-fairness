Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  69  92  41  86
1  82  91  19  22  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a greedy approach where each agent is assigned items based on their valuations, trying to maximize their total value while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. 

In this scenario, there are five items to be distributed between two agents. Let's go through the items and allocate them:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 91.
   - Agent 1 values it at 82.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 69.
   - Agent 1 values it at 91.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 92.
   - Agent 1 values it at 19.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 41.
   - Agent 1 values it at 22.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 86.
   - Agent 1 values it at 97.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, we have allocated three items to Agent 0 and two items to Agent 1. This maintains a balance in the number of items each agent receives:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.
