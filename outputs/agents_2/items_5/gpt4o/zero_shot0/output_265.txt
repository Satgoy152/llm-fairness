Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  18  31   9  48  41
1  16  11  31  25  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the total value of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and try to distribute items to balance these totals.

Let's summarize the total values for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Total value = 18 (item 0) + 31 (item 1) + 9 (item 2) + 48 (item 3) + 41 (item 4) = 147

- Agent 1:
  - Total value = 16 (item 0) + 11 (item 1) + 31 (item 2) + 25 (item 3) + 88 (item 4) = 171

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 1, so initially allocate it to Agent 1.
2. Items 3 and 0 are more valuable to Agent 0; allocate them to Agent 0.
3. Item 1 has a higher value for Agent 0, so allocate it to Agent 0.
4. Item 2 is valued equally by both agents, but to balance the allocations, we can give it to Agent 1.

After this allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 1, 3
  - Total value for Agent 0 = 18 (item 0) + 31 (item 1) + 48 (item 3) = 97

- Agent 1 gets items: 2, 4
  - Total value for Agent 1 = 31 (item 2) + 88 (item 4) = 119

This allocation is reasonably fair given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
