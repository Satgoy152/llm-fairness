Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85   1  53  98  65
1  86  36  35  75  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations assigned by each agent to the items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

First, let's summarize the valuations for each agent:

Agent 0: 
- Item 0: 85
- Item 1: 1
- Item 2: 53
- Item 3: 98
- Item 4: 65

Agent 1: 
- Item 0: 86
- Item 1: 36
- Item 2: 35
- Item 3: 75
- Item 4: 85

A common method to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "maximum sum" strategy, where items are allocated to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items. 

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 85
   - Agent 1 values it at 86
   - Allocate to Agent 1

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 1
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 53
   - Agent 1 values it at 35
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 98
   - Agent 1 values it at 75
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 65
   - Agent 1 values it at 85
   - Allocate to Agent 1

Now, let's calculate the number of items allocated to each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
