Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  53  50  55  98
1  51  97  94  20  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One simple way to do this is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items.

Let's allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Compare the valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 40, Agent 1 values it at 51. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 values it at 97. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 values it at 94. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 20. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 55. Allocate to Agent 0.

2. Check the allocation:
   - Agent 0 receives items 3 and 4.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 2.

The allocations can be represented in the specified JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
