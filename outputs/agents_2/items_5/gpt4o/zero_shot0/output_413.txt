Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  58  95  21  44
1  60  10  56  14  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll assess the potential allocations based on the given valuations and aim to balance the total value as much as possible.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 17
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 95
  - Item 3: 21
  - Item 4: 44

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 56
  - Item 3: 14
  - Item 4: 86

To balance the allocation, let's consider the highest valuation for each item and try to assign the item to the agent who values it the most. We can then adjust to balance the total value.

1. **Item Allocations**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (values it at 60 vs. Agent 0's 17)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (values it at 58 vs. Agent 1's 10)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (values it at 95 vs. Agent 1's 56)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (values it at 21 vs. Agent 1's 14)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (values it at 86 vs. Agent 0's 44)

2. **Final Allocations**:
   - Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2, 3
   - Agent 1 gets items: 0, 4

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, as Agent 0 receives items with a total valuation of 174 (58 + 95 + 21) and Agent 1 receives items with a total valuation of 146 (60 + 86).
