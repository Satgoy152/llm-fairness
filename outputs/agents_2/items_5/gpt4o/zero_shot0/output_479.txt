Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  33  24  51   7
1  92  73  64  57  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that both agents feel they have received a fair share, given their own valuations.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for each possible division of items:

### Agent 0 Valuations:
- Item 0: 40
- Item 1: 33
- Item 2: 24
- Item 3: 51
- Item 4: 7

### Agent 1 Valuations:
- Item 0: 92
- Item 1: 73
- Item 2: 64
- Item 3: 57
- Item 4: 95

To allocate items fairly, we need to ensure that the sum of the values for each agent is as balanced as possible.

#### Strategy:
1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they were to receive each item. 
2. Distribute items to each agent such that the total value is as balanced as possible.

##### Calculation:
- Agent 0's total valuation for all items: 40 + 33 + 24 + 51 + 7 = 155
- Agent 1's total valuation for all items: 92 + 73 + 64 + 57 + 95 = 381

Given the wide valuation difference, we need to carefully select items to balance the valuations as closely as possible.

#### Allocation:
- Assign items with higher valuation differences to the agent valuing them more.
- Avoid giving all high-value items to one agent unless necessary.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: More value to Agent 1 (92 vs. 40).
2. **Item 1**: More value to Agent 1 (73 vs. 33).
3. **Item 2**: More value to Agent 1 (64 vs. 24).
4. **Item 3**: More value to Agent 0 (51 vs. 57).
5. **Item 4**: More value to Agent 1 (95 vs. 7).

Based on these valuations, a fair allocation that balances the total values might be:
- Agent 0: Items 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2, 4

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Value of 51
- Agent 1: Value of 92 + 73 + 64 + 95 = 324

Even though the allocation isn't perfectly balanced due to the significant difference in overall valuations, this distribution maximizes fairness by considering each item's individual worth to each agent.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
