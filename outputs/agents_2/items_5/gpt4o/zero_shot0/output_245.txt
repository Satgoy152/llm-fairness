Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  46  34  37  26
1  93  19  37  19  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here is one approach:

1. For each item, we look at which agent values it more and allocate the item to that agent.
2. If an agent receives more items than the other, we can try to balance the number of items between the agents while keeping the allocation optimal in terms of value.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 93, whereas Agent 0 values it at 85. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 46, whereas Agent 1 values it at 19. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 37, whereas Agent 0 values it at 34. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Both agents value this item equally at 37 and 19 respectively, but since Agent 0 values it more, allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 70, whereas Agent 0 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, we check the allocation balance:

- Agent 0 has items: [1, 3]
- Agent 1 has items: [0, 2, 4]

Both agents have a fair number of items in terms of the total value. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
