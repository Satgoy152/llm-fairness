Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45   3  21  77  46
1  34  28  31  18  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. A common approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" method, which aims to minimize envy between agents by ensuring that each agent receives items such that they value their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of the other agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 77
  - Item 4: 46

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 28
  - Item 2: 31
  - Item 3: 18
  - Item 4: 30

The goal is to allocate the items so that each agent's total valuation is as equal as possible.

Let's proceed with a possible allocation:

1. Start by allocating items with the largest disparity in valuations to the agent who values them higher. For instance, Item 3 is valued much higher by Agent 0 (77) compared to Agent 1 (18). Therefore, allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Similarly, Item 1 is valued more by Agent 1 (28) compared to Agent 0 (3). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Next, consider Item 0, which Agent 0 values significantly higher (45) than Agent 1 (34). Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
4. For Item 4, Agent 0 values it slightly higher (46) than Agent 1 (30), so allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.
5. Finally, Item 2 has a closer valuation, but Agent 1 values it slightly higher (31) than Agent 0 (21). Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent:
- Agent 0: 45 (Item 0) + 77 (Item 3) + 46 (Item 4) = 168
- Agent 1: 28 (Item 1) + 31 (Item 2) = 59

This allocation is skewed, so let's adjust to make them fairer:

Re-evaluate allocation:
- Give Item 0 and Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Give Item 1, Item 2, and Item 4 to Agent 1.

Recalculate:
- Agent 0: 45 (Item 0) + 77 (Item 3) = 122
- Agent 1: 28 (Item 1) + 31 (Item 2) + 30 (Item 4) = 89

This allocation is closer in total valuation, but still not perfect. The best allocation with integer items may not result in perfectly equal valuations, but aims to minimize the difference.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
