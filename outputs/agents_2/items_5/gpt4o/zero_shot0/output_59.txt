Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  61  93  68  75  72
1  89  12  18  17  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their valuations for each item. Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive for different allocations and then choose the fairest option.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

```
Agent 0: [61, 93, 68, 75, 72]
Agent 1: [89, 12, 18, 17, 27]
```

One way to allocate the items is to maximize the sum of values each agent receives while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. Let's try a few allocations:

### Allocation 1:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1, 2], and Agent 1 gets items [3, 4].

Calculating the total value for each agent:
- Agent 0: 61 (item 0) + 93 (item 1) + 68 (item 2) = 222
- Agent 1: 17 (item 3) + 27 (item 4) = 44

### Allocation 2:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 3, 4], and Agent 1 gets items [1, 2].

Calculating the total value for each agent:
- Agent 0: 61 (item 0) + 75 (item 3) + 72 (item 4) = 208
- Agent 1: 12 (item 1) + 18 (item 2) = 30

### Allocation 3:
- Agent 0 gets items [1, 2, 4], and Agent 1 gets items [0, 3].

Calculating the total value for each agent:
- Agent 0: 93 (item 1) + 68 (item 2) + 72 (item 4) = 233
- Agent 1: 89 (item 0) + 17 (item 3) = 106

### Fair Allocation:
Upon reviewing the allocations, Allocation 3 seems to provide a reasonably fair distribution of values between the agents. 

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 233 and Agent 1 a total value of 106.
