Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  58  97  69  67
1  73   3  85  16  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a strategy like the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, where agents and items are the two sets of the graph. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for both agents while ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Here is the table of valuations for easier reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 84     | 58     | 97     | 69     | 67     |
| 1     | 73     | 3      | 85     | 16     | 84     |

Now, we need to allocate these items to the agents based on their valuations:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (97), and agent 1 values it at 85. Assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values item 4 at 84, higher than agent 0's valuation of 67. Assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 at 84, higher than agent 1's valuation of 73. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 at 69, higher than agent 1's valuation of 16. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
5. **Item 1**: Only item left, assign to agent 1.

After these allocations, we have:

- Agent 0 has items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 has items 1 and 4.

The allocations in the requested JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
