Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   0  11  24  41  50
1  96  67  75  31  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations.

Let's go through the allocation process:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 0  
- Item 1: 11  
- Item 2: 24  
- Item 3: 41  
- Item 4: 50  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 96  
- Item 1: 67  
- Item 2: 75  
- Item 3: 31  
- Item 4: 93  

To maximize fairness, we can use a greedy approach to allocate each item to the agent that values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 96, which is higher than Agent 0's 0, so assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 67, which is higher than Agent 0's 11, so assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 75, which is higher than Agent 0's 24, so assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 41, which is higher than Agent 1's 31, so assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 93, which is higher than Agent 0's 50, so assign to Agent 1.

After the initial allocation, Agent 0 has only one item, while Agent 1 has four. To ensure each agent gets an integer number of items while aiming for fairness, we can adjust the allocations:

- Reallocate Item 4 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it fairly high (50), and this would balance the distribution more evenly.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
