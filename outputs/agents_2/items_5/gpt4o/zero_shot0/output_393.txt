Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  28  28  85  86
1  83  38  61  29  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 38 61 29 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 87
- Item 1: 28
- Item 2: 28
- Item 3: 85
- Item 4: 86

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 83
- Item 1: 38
- Item 2: 61
- Item 3: 29
- Item 4: 51

To allocate the items fairly, we can use a strategy that considers maximizing the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's allocate the items:

1. Compare the values for each item between the two agents. Allocate the item to the agent who values it more highly.
2. If both agents value an item equally, we need to ensure that each agent ends up with an integer number of items, and we may need to consider the overall distribution of item values.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values this at 87, while Agent 1 values it at 83. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values this at 28, while Agent 1 values it at 38. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values this at 28, while Agent 1 values it at 61. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values this at 85, while Agent 1 values it at 29. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values this at 86, while Agent 1 values it at 51. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
