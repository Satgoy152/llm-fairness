Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  94  47  27  78  85
1  64  90  59  33  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and decide on an allocation strategy:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 94  
- Item 1: 47  
- Item 2: 27  
- Item 3: 78  
- Item 4: 85  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 64  
- Item 1: 90  
- Item 2: 59  
- Item 3: 33  
- Item 4: 28  

One approach is to assign items to the agent who values them more, thereby maximizing the total perceived value for each agent. Let's examine each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 94; Agent 1 values it at 64. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 47; Agent 1 values it at 90. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 27; Agent 1 values it at 59. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 78; Agent 1 values it at 33. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 85; Agent 1 values it at 28. Allocate to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value most, and Agent 1 receives the items they value more than Agent 0 does.
