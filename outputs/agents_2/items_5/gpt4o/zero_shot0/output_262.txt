Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  28  18  60  46
1  46  50  12  69  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One method to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 46. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 28, and Agent 1 values it at 50. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 18, and Agent 1 values it at 12. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 60, and Agent 1 values it at 69. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 46, and Agent 1 values it at 74. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, given the constraints that each agent gets an integer number of items.
