Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  94  97  74  44
1  56  30  71  52  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use an approach that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. One common method is to use a simple greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here is how we can do it:

1. Evaluate each item and determine which agent values it more.
2. Allocate the item to the agent who values it higher.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 65, and Agent 1 values it at 56. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 94, and Agent 1 values it at 30. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 71. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 74, and Agent 1 values it at 52. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 44, and Agent 1 values it at 10. Allocate to Agent 0.

After evaluating all items, it turns out Agent 0 values all items higher than Agent 1 does. Therefore, we can allocate all items to Agent 0:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most.
