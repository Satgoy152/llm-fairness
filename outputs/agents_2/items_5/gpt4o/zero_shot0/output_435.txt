Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  11  53  99  97
1  43  69  12  11   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's how we can proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the following valuations: [65, 11, 53, 99, 97].
2. **Agent 1** has the following valuations: [43, 69, 12, 11, 3].

The goal is to allocate the items such that both agents maximize their perceived value.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

- **Item 3**: Highest value for Agent 0 (99) vs Agent 1 (11). Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Next highest for Agent 0 (97) vs Agent 1 (3). Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 0**: Next highest for Agent 0 (65) vs Agent 1 (43). Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Highest value for Agent 1 (69) vs Agent 0 (11). Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Next highest for Agent 0 (53) vs Agent 1 (12). Allocate to Agent 0.

**Resulting Allocations:**

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [1]

Thus, the JSON allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1]
}
```
