Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12   7  61  78  39
1  60  24  12  23   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should try to maximize the total utility for both agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The given valuations are as follows:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 12
- Item 1: 7
- Item 2: 61
- Item 3: 78
- Item 4: 39

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 60
- Item 1: 24
- Item 2: 12
- Item 3: 23
- Item 4: 0

To achieve a fair allocation, let's consider a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their respective valuations. We'll assign the items by considering the highest value each agent has for the remaining items.

1. Agent 0 values Item 3 the most (78), so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values Item 0 the most (60), so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0's next highest value is Item 2 (61), so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 1's next highest value is Item 1 (24), so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
5. The remaining item is Item 4, which Agent 0 values at 39 and Agent 1 values at 0. It is more beneficial for Agent 0, so we allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

Therefore, the allocation is as follows:

Agent 0 receives Items [2, 3, 4].
Agent 1 receives Items [0, 1].

In the required JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
