Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  75  93  93  32
1  90  82  40  72  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [90 82 40 72 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent, while ensuring that the number of items is fairly distributed. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [70, 75, 93, 93, 32]
- Agent 1 values: [90, 82, 40, 72, 84]

Let's allocate the items by considering the highest value differences between agents for each item, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it higher (90 vs. 70), so allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it higher (75 vs. 82), so allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it higher (93 vs. 40), so allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it higher (93 vs. 72), so allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it higher (84 vs. 32), so allocate to Agent 1.

This ensures a fair distribution and maximizes the total value for each agent given their preferences.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
