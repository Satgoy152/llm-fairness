Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  38   9  37  63
1  98  26  10   9  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's evaluate each item:

- **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 26, while Agent 1 values it at 98. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 38, while Agent 1 values it at 26. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 9, while Agent 1 values it at 10. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 37, while Agent 1 values it at 9. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 63, while Agent 1 values it at 23. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

Based on these valuations, the allocations would be:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
