Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  84  37  61  13
1  96  11  68  56  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common method to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [17, 84, 37, 61, 13]
- Agent 1's valuations: [96, 11, 68, 56, 17]

We will allocate each item to the agent who has the higher valuation for that item:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 96, whereas Agent 0 values it at 17. Assign to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 84, whereas Agent 1 values it at 11. Assign to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 68, whereas Agent 0 values it at 37. Assign to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 61, whereas Agent 1 values it at 56. Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 13, whereas Agent 1 values it at 17. Assign to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation approach, the agents receive the following items:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2, 4]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
