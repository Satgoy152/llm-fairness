Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  61  13  74  72
1  62  47  60  39  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 47 60 39 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction by trying to assign items such that the total valuation is maximized. One approach is to assign the items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring both agents get a relatively fair share of items.

Let's look at the valuation table again:

Agent 0 valuations: [55, 61, 13, 74, 72]  
Agent 1 valuations: [62, 47, 60, 39, 14]

Assign the items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 62, while Agent 0 values it at 55. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 61, while Agent 1 values it at 47. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 60, while Agent 0 values it at 13. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 74, while Agent 1 values it at 39. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 72, while Agent 1 values it at 14. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair distribution of items based on their preferences.

The final allocations in the specified JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
