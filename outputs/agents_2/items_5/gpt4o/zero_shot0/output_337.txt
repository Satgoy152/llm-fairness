Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  60  78  24  92
1  57  92   9  88  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This can often be approached using optimization techniques or algorithms like the Hungarian method for assignment problems. Given the small size of the problem, we can also solve this problem by inspection for a simple optimal allocation.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive for some potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, 4** and **Agent 1 gets items 1, 3**:
   - Agent 0: 65 (item 0) + 78 (item 2) + 92 (item 4) = 235
   - Agent 1: 92 (item 1) + 88 (item 3) = 180

2. **Agent 0 gets items 0, 3, 4** and **Agent 1 gets items 1, 2**:
   - Agent 0: 65 (item 0) + 24 (item 3) + 92 (item 4) = 181
   - Agent 1: 92 (item 1) + 9 (item 2) = 101

3. **Agent 0 gets items 1, 3, 4** and **Agent 1 gets items 0, 2**:
   - Agent 0: 60 (item 1) + 24 (item 3) + 92 (item 4) = 176
   - Agent 1: 57 (item 0) + 9 (item 2) = 66

The first allocation seems to be the most beneficial for both agents in terms of maximizing the individual agent's total value. 

Therefore, the allocation that fairly distributes the items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
