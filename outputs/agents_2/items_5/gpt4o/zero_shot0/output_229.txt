Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  89  5  25  90  90
1  23  4  77  57  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and aim to maximize the total satisfaction for both agents.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [89, 5, 25, 90, 90]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [23, 4, 77, 57, 51]

One approach to fairly allocate the items is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a method that attempts to give each agent the items they value most, while also keeping the total number of items balanced between them. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 89, and Agent 1 values it at 23.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 5, and Agent 1 values it at 4.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value, though both values are low).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 25, and Agent 1 values it at 77.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 90, and Agent 1 values it at 57.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 90, and Agent 1 values it at 51.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 3, while Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4. This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
