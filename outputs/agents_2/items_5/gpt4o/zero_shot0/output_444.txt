Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  27  27  64  79  50
1  20   9  69  23  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. This approach involves assigning items such that the total value of the items assigned to each agent is balanced or as close as possible, given their preferences.

Let's evaluate the situation:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 27
- Item 1: 27
- Item 2: 64
- Item 3: 79
- Item 4: 50

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 20
- Item 1: 9
- Item 2: 69
- Item 3: 23
- Item 4: 82

We aim to allocate the items to balance the total value each agent receives. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign items to Agent 0:
   - Item 2 (Agent 0 values at 64, Agent 1 values at 69)
   - Item 3 (Agent 0 values at 79, Agent 1 values at 23)
   - Total value for Agent 0: 64 + 79 = 143

2. Assign items to Agent 1:
   - Item 0 (Agent 0 values at 27, Agent 1 values at 20)
   - Item 1 (Agent 0 values at 27, Agent 1 values at 9)
   - Item 4 (Agent 0 values at 50, Agent 1 values at 82)
   - Total value for Agent 1: 20 + 9 + 82 = 111

This allocation results in a close balance of total values, with Agent 0 receiving items with a higher combined value, but Agent 1 receives more items. Given the constraints and the goal of maximizing each agent's satisfaction, this is a fair distribution.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
