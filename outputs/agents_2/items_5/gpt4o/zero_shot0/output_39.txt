Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  12  86  20  26
1  42  19  22  48  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. Let's distribute the items to the agents based on their valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 98  
- Item 1: 12  
- Item 2: 86  
- Item 3: 20  
- Item 4: 26  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 42  
- Item 1: 19  
- Item 2: 22  
- Item 3: 48  
- Item 4: 62  

To maximize fairness, we can allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent receives a fair share:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation from Agent 0 (98 vs. 42)
2. Item 1: Highest valuation from Agent 0 (12 vs. 19)
3. Item 2: Highest valuation from Agent 0 (86 vs. 22)
4. Item 3: Highest valuation from Agent 1 (20 vs. 48)
5. Item 4: Highest valuation from Agent 1 (26 vs. 62)

Based on these valuations, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, 4

This ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
