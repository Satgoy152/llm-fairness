Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  75  51  59   3  24
1   3  75  51  25  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One possible approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 75, and Agent 1 values it at 3. So, item 0 goes to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 51, and Agent 1 values it at 75. So, item 1 goes to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 59, and Agent 1 values it at 51. So, item 2 goes to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 3, and Agent 1 values it at 25. So, item 3 goes to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 24, and Agent 1 values it at 59. So, item 4 goes to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

Here, Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 4. This allocation is based on maximizing the utility for each agent for the items they value the most.
