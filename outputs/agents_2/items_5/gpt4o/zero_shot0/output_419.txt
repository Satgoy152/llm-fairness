Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  98  89  15  76
1  71  87  83  64   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent. One common approach is to use the "maximum weight matching" problem solution from graph theory.

Let's analyze the given valuations and allocate the items:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 92
- Item 1: 98
- Item 2: 89
- Item 3: 15
- Item 4: 76

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 71
- Item 1: 87
- Item 2: 83
- Item 3: 64
- Item 4: 6

To maximize the total valuation, let's consider allocating based on the highest value difference for each item, favoring the agent who values each item more:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 92, Agent 1 values it at 71. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 87. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 values it at 83. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 values it at 64. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 values it at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.

Therefore, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they value more relative to the other agent, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
