Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  64  23  70  79  52
1  32   4  41  56  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. In this scenario, we will allocate items one by one to the agent that values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 64.
   - Agent 1 values it at 32.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 23.
   - Agent 1 values it at 4.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 70.
   - Agent 1 values it at 41.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79.
   - Agent 1 values it at 56.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 52.
   - Agent 1 values it at 14.
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

Reviewing the allocations, we see that Agent 0 has received all items, which is not fair. Therefore, we should aim to balance the allocations more equitably.

Let's reallocate:

1. **Items 0, 1, 2**: Agent 0 values these significantly more than Agent 1, so we can allocate these to Agent 0.

2. **Items 3, 4**: Although Agent 0 values these items more, Agent 1 should receive some items to ensure fairness. Given the significant value difference for Item 3, it should go to Agent 0. Item 4, however, can be allocated to Agent 1 to balance the total value received.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4]
}
```
