Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19   8  14  34  37
1  73  40  48  81  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each gets an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each item is allocated, and considering each agent's preferences.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 19
- Item 1: 8
- Item 2: 14
- Item 3: 34
- Item 4: 37

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 73
- Item 1: 40
- Item 2: 48
- Item 3: 81
- Item 4: 76

We aim for a fair distribution of items that also considers maximizing total valuations for both agents.

A potential fair allocation could be:
- Assign items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 0, as these items have relatively lower values to Agent 1 compared to the other items.
- Assign items 3 and 4 to Agent 1, as these items have high values to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

Agent 0:
- Total value: 19 (Item 0) + 8 (Item 1) + 14 (Item 2) = 41

Agent 1:
- Total value: 81 (Item 3) + 76 (Item 4) = 157

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
