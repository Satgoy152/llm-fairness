Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  20  65  50   3
1  48   3  96  12  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations, we can use a strategy where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's examine the valuations for each item and assign them accordingly:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 56, and Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 20, and Agent 1 values it at 3. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 65, and Agent 1 values it at 96. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 50, and Agent 1 values it at 12. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 3, and Agent 1 values it at 48. Assign to Agent 1.

Based on these allocations, here is the final JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
