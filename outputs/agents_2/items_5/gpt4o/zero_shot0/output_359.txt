Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0  1   2   3   4
0  43  8  14   4  89
1  41  0  88  55  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the optimal allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 89, followed by item 0 at 43.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 88, followed by item 3 at 55.

A possible fair allocation could be:
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it's their highest valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as it's their highest valued item.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it's the next highest valued item for them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it's the next highest valued item for them.
- The remaining item 1 has the lowest valuations from both agents. It can be allocated to Agent 0 to balance the number of items per agent.

Thus, the allocation can be represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
