Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69   8  81  97  19
1  41  89  51  87  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 89 51 87 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [69, 8, 81, 97, 19]
Agent 1: [41, 89, 51, 87, 78]
```

Let's calculate the total value each agent would get if we allocate each item to them, and then try to balance these totals.

### Step 1: Initial Analysis
- Agent 0 values:
  - Total value if Agent 0 gets all items: 69 + 8 + 81 + 97 + 19 = 274

- Agent 1 values:
  - Total value if Agent 1 gets all items: 41 + 89 + 51 + 87 + 78 = 346

### Step 2: Fair Allocation
We aim to split the items so that both agents receive a relatively balanced total value.

1. **Item 3** has a high value for both agents, but significantly more for Agent 0. Allocating it to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0: 97
   - Agent 1: 0

2. **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 1. Allocating it to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0: 97
   - Agent 1: 89

3. **Item 0** is the next highest value for Agent 0. Allocating it to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0: 97 + 69 = 166
   - Agent 1: 89

4. **Item 4** is of more value to Agent 1. Allocating it to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0: 166
   - Agent 1: 89 + 78 = 167

5. **Item 2** can be allocated to Agent 0 to balance a bit more:
   - Agent 0: 166 + 81 = 247
   - Agent 1: 167

Now, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 has items 3, 0, and 2.
- Agent 1 has items 1 and 4.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive a fair and balanced total value based on their preferences, given the constraints that each gets an integer number of items.
