Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  89  52  99  91
1   5  98  56  30  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 28  
- Item 1: 89  
- Item 2: 52  
- Item 3: 99  
- Item 4: 91  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 5  
- Item 1: 98  
- Item 2: 56  
- Item 3: 30  
- Item 4: 56  

Let's look at the difference in valuations for each item and allocate items where each agent has a higher valuation over the other:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (28 vs 5)
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (98 vs 89)
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (56 vs 52)
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (99 vs 30)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (91 vs 56)

Now, we need to ensure each agent gets a fair allocation. Since there are 5 items, one agent will get 3 items and the other agent will get 2 items. Let's proceed with this allocation while ensuring each agent's total valuation is maximized:

1. Assign items with the highest difference in favor of one agent.
2. Ensure a balanced number of items.

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 3, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 2

This gives:

- Agent 0 a total valuation of \(28 + 99 + 91 = 218\)
- Agent 1 a total valuation of \(98 + 56 = 154\)

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
