Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79  18   2  64  95
1  90  46  77   0  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation. This often involves using a strategy known as maximizing the minimum valuation of each agent.

Considering the given valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 79
- Item 1: 18
- Item 2: 2
- Item 3: 64
- Item 4: 95

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 90
- Item 1: 46
- Item 2: 77
- Item 3: 0
- Item 4: 92

One way to approach this allocation is to use a simple greedy algorithm where we assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item. However, we must also ensure that the allocation is fair, meaning each agent should end up with a similar total valuation. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 90.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 values it at 46.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 values it at 77.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 values it at 0.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 92.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

The allocations are as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2

Here is the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
