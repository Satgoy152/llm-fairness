Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  71  44  37  90  20
1  12  61  43  72  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. In this scenario, we will aim to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the sum of the valuations for each agent.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:
- Agent 0: [71, 44, 37, 90, 20]
- Agent 1: [12, 61, 43, 72, 10]

Let's examine the values for each item and allocate them in a way to maximize fairness:

1. Item 3 has a high value for both agents, but significantly higher for Agent 0 (90 vs. 72). Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1 (61 vs. 44). Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 0 (71 vs. 12). Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 2 is moderately higher for Agent 1 (43 vs. 37). Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4 is low for both but still higher for Agent 0 (20 vs. 10). Allocate to Agent 0.

By following these allocations, we attempt to balance the distribution fairly based on the values:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 3, 4
- Agent 1 gets items: 1, 2

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
