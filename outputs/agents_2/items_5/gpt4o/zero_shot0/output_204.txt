Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  57  67  66  59  22
1  49   7  36  77  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [49  7 36 77 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [57, 67, 66, 59, 22]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [49, 7, 36, 77, 97]

To find a fair allocation, we can use a greedy approach by allocating the item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 57, and Agent 1 values it at 49. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 67, and Agent 1 values it at 7. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 66, and Agent 1 values it at 36. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 59, and Agent 1 values it at 77. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 22, and Agent 1 values it at 97. Allocate to Agent 1.

The allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```
