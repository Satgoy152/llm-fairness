Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  97  80  64  75
1  80  62  58  16   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while taking into account their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. One common approach is to use the "Max-Min" algorithm, which aims to maximize the minimum valuation that an agent could receive. Let's consider the valuations provided:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 77
- Item 1: 97
- Item 2: 80
- Item 3: 64
- Item 4: 75

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 80
- Item 1: 62
- Item 2: 58
- Item 3: 16
- Item 4: 1

To achieve a fair allocation, we can try to distribute the items to maximize each agent's total valuation. Since there are five items and two agents, we can allocate three items to one agent and two items to the other. We can use a strategic approach to balance the allocations.

Let's try one possible allocation:

1. Assign items with the highest differences in valuation to the agent that values them more.
2. Balance the remaining items to ensure a fair distribution.

Following these principles, a possible allocation is:

- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (valuation: 97 vs. 62)
- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (valuation: 80 vs. 77)
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (valuation: 80 vs. 58)
- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (valuation: 64 vs. 16)
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (valuation: 1 vs. 75)

This allocation gives:

Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3 (valuations: 97, 80, 64)
Agent 1: Items 0, 4 (valuations: 80, 1)

Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
