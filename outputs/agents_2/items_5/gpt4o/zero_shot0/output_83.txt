Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  11  97  12  32  26
1  33  39  88  12  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider how to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Values for items are [11, 97, 12, 32, 26], Total = 178
   - Agent 1: Values for items are [33, 39, 88, 12, 13], Total = 185

2. **Determine the Allocation:**
   - We aim to maximize each agent's total value by assigning items that are valued more by one agent than the other.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring each gets a fair share by the end.

4. **Allocate Based on Valuations:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (33 vs 11), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (97 vs 39), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (88 vs 12), assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (32 vs 12), assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (26 vs 13), assign to Agent 0.

5. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 2]

6. **JSON Format for the Allocation:**
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value more on average, and Agent 1 the items they value more, achieving a fair distribution based on their valuations.
