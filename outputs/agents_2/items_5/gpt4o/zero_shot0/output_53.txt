Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  28  43  52  29
1   1  17  29  91  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's go through the allocations step by step:

### Step 1: Analyze Valuations
- Agent 0 has the following valuations: [70, 28, 43, 52, 29]
- Agent 1 has the following valuations: [1, 17, 29, 91, 81]

### Step 2: Assign Items
To allocate items fairly, we can use a method such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent. Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent:

1. **Item 0** is valued highest by Agent 0 at 70.
2. **Item 1** is valued higher by Agent 0 at 28 compared to Agent 1's 17.
3. **Item 2** is valued higher by Agent 0 at 43 compared to Agent 1's 29.
4. **Item 3** is valued highest by Agent 1 at 91.
5. **Item 4** is valued higher by Agent 1 at 81 compared to Agent 0's 29.

### Step 3: Allocate Based on Valuations
- Agent 0 should receive items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 should receive items 3 and 4.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the satisfaction for both agents based on their valuations.
