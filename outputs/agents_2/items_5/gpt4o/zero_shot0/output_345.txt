Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  30  42  36  20   3
1  29  47  30  74  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One possible approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it more, provided that it helps balance the total value across agents.

Let's evaluate the values:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 30, Agent 1 values it at 29.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 values it at 47.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 30.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 values it at 74.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 values it at 99.

We will start by allocating each item to the agent who values it more:

1. Item 0: Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Allocate to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation looks like this:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 4

This allocation is fair in terms that Agent 0 gets two items and Agent 1 gets three, based on their relative valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
