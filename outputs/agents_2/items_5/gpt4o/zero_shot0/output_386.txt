Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  48   0  90  18   5
1  35  40  78  13  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes each agent's satisfaction given their preferences. One common way to do this is through a method called "Envy-Free" allocation, where each agent receives items in a manner such that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the given valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

Agent 0's valuations: [48, 0, 90, 18, 5]  
Agent 1's valuations: [35, 40, 78, 13, 56]

A possible allocation approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 48, Agent 1 values it at 35. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 values it at 40. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 values it at 78. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 18, Agent 1 values it at 13. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 values it at 56. Assign to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation based on maximizing each agent's valuation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent items that they value highly while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
