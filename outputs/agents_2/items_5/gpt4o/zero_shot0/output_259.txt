Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  84  91  88  27  95
1  45  24  58   1  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We will assign items to agents based on which agent values each item more. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Compare the valuations of each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who has the higher valuation for that particular item.

Let's go through each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 84, and Agent 1 values it at 45. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 91, and Agent 1 values it at 24. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 88, and Agent 1 values it at 58. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 27, and Agent 1 values it at 1. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 95, and Agent 1 values it at 26. Assign to Agent 0.

In this case, Agent 0 has a higher valuation for each item, so all items are allocated to Agent 0.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": []
}
```
