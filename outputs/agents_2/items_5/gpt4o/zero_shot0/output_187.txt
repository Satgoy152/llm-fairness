Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  41  84  26  80
1  59  42  67  26  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **List the valuations for each agent:**
   - Agent 0's valuations: [82, 41, 84, 26, 80]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [59, 42, 67, 26, 78]

2. **Compare valuations for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 82, Agent 1 values it at 59. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 41, Agent 1 values it at 42. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 values it at 67. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Both agents value it at 26. Allocate to either with lower total valuation so far. Initially, allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 values it at 78. Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Allocate each item based on the above comparison:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 4
   - Agent 1: Items 1, 3

4. **Present allocations in the requested JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items while considering their valuations.
