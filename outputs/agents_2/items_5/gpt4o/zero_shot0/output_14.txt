Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  60  69  45  81
1  26  10  11  49  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Valuations:**

   - Agent 0's valuations: [92, 60, 69, 45, 81]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [26, 10, 11, 49, 58]

2. **Calculate the total value if each agent receives all items:**

   - Total value for Agent 0: 92 + 60 + 69 + 45 + 81 = 347
   - Total value for Agent 1: 26 + 10 + 11 + 49 + 58 = 154

3. **Determine a fair allocation:**

   To ensure fairness, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is balanced. We can start by assigning items based on the highest relative valuation for each agent.

4. **Allocate Items:**

   - Item 0: Highest valuation is from Agent 0 (92). Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Highest valuation is from Agent 0 (60). Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Highest valuation is from Agent 0 (69). Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Higher valuation is from Agent 1 (49). Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Higher valuation is from Agent 0 (81), but to balance, consider Agent 1 (58). Assign to Agent 1 for balance.

5. **Check Allocation:**

   - Agent 0 receives items: [0, 1, 2]
   - Agent 1 receives items: [3, 4]

   Total valuation for each agent with this allocation:
   - Agent 0: 92 + 60 + 69 = 221
   - Agent 1: 49 + 58 = 107

   This allocation aims to balance the fairness considering their initial total valuation difference.

6. **Final Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share of the total value based on their respective valuations.
