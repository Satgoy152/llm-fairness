Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   4  83  37  79  26
1  59  43  56   6  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm, where items are allocated to the agent who values them the most, while also ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items.

Let's evaluate each item and allocate it to the agent who values it more:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 values it at 59. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 83, Agent 1 values it at 43. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 37, Agent 1 values it at 56. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 79, Agent 1 values it at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 26, Agent 1 values it at 83. Allocate to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
