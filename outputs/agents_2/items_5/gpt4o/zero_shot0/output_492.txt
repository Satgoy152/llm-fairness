Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  86  23  31  52
1  78  54  29  61  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while considering their respective valuations. One common approach is to use algorithms or methods like the "envy-free" or "maximum sum of valuations" allocation. Here, I will use a simple approach to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items and then allocate the items in a manner that maximizes the valuation for each agent.

Agent 0 valuations:  
- Item 0: 47  
- Item 1: 86  
- Item 2: 23  
- Item 3: 31  
- Item 4: 52  
- Total: 47 + 86 + 23 + 31 + 52 = 239  

Agent 1 valuations:  
- Item 0: 78  
- Item 1: 54  
- Item 2: 29  
- Item 3: 61  
- Item 4: 15  
- Total: 78 + 54 + 29 + 61 + 15 = 237  

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Since Agent 0 has a higher total valuation, we should try to give them items that they value more than Agent 1.

1. Item 0:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 47  
   - Agent 1 values it at 78  
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value)

2. Item 1:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 86  
   - Agent 1 values it at 54  
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value)

3. Item 2:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 23  
   - Agent 1 values it at 29  
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value)

4. Item 3:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 31  
   - Agent 1 values it at 61  
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value)

5. Item 4:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 52  
   - Agent 1 values it at 15  
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value)

Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3]

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
