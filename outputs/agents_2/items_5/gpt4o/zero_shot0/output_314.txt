Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  33  63   6  32
1  44  71  84  82  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A simple approach is to assign items based on the maximum valuation each agent has for the items. Here's how it might proceed:

1. **Analyze the Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 valuations: [97, 33, 63, 6, 32]
   - Agent 1 valuations: [44, 71, 84, 82, 32]

2. **Item Allocation:**
   - For each item, assign it to the agent who values it the most. In case of ties, we can choose based on remaining items to allocate or randomly.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 44. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 33, and Agent 1 values it at 71. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 63, and Agent 1 values it at 84. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 6, and Agent 1 values it at 82. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 32, and Agent 1 values it at 32. Since both have equal value, we can assign it to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [0, 4].
   - Agent 1 gets items [1, 2, 3].

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
