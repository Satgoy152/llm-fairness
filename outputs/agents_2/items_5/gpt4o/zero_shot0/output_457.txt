Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  39  59  58  70   5
1  66  87  36   7  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and ideally, the allocation should maximize the total value received by each agent. Let's analyze the given valuations for each item:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 39  
- Item 1: 59  
- Item 2: 58  
- Item 3: 70  
- Item 4: 5  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 66  
- Item 1: 87  
- Item 2: 36  
- Item 3: 7  
- Item 4: 75  

To find a fair allocation, we will assign items to maximize the total value for each agent. Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (value 87 for Agent 1, value 59 for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (value 75 for Agent 1, value 5 for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 70 for Agent 0, value 7 for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 66 for Agent 1, value 39 for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (value 58 for Agent 0, value 36 for Agent 1)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of items based on their valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items with a total value of 70 + 58 = 128
- Agent 1 receives items with a total value of 87 + 75 + 66 = 228

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
