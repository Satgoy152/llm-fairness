Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  76  52  15   0   5
1  27  45  45  71  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we'll use a simple approach to maximize the total satisfaction of both agents. We'll assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [76, 52, 15, 0, 5]
- Agent 1's valuations: [27, 45, 45, 71, 60]

We'll allocate each item to the agent who values it more:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 76, and Agent 1 values it at 27. Agent 0 gets this item.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 52, and Agent 1 values it at 45. Agent 0 gets this item.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 15, and Agent 1 values it at 45. Agent 1 gets this item.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 0, and Agent 1 values it at 71. Agent 1 gets this item.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 5, and Agent 1 values it at 60. Agent 1 gets this item.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and each item is allocated to the agent who values it more.
