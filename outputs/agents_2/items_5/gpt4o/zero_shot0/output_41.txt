Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  10  61   9  26
1   8  14   2  64  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 14  2 64 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a heuristic approach such as the "maximize minimum envy" method or simply by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given the valuations provided, let's work through a potential allocation.

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [17, 10, 61, 9, 26]
- Agent 1: [8, 14, 2, 64, 30]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most to maximize individual satisfaction.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Valuations: Agent 0 = 17, Agent 1 = 8
  - Assign to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

- **Item 1**: 
  - Valuations: Agent 0 = 10, Agent 1 = 14
  - Assign to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

- **Item 2**: 
  - Valuations: Agent 0 = 61, Agent 1 = 2
  - Assign to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

- **Item 3**: 
  - Valuations: Agent 0 = 9, Agent 1 = 64
  - Assign to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

- **Item 4**: 
  - Valuations: Agent 0 = 26, Agent 1 = 30
  - Assign to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

### Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

### JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This JSON format represents the allocation where Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 4.
