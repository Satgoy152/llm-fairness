Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1  2   3   4
0  85  19  3  78  42
1  80  52  2  94  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm or optimization techniques such as linear programming or the Hungarian algorithm, especially when the number of agents and items is small.

In this case, we'll use a simple greedy approach to allocate the items:

1. Start by comparing the valuations of each agent for each item.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.
3. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's apply this approach to the given table:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 at 80. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 at 52. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 3, Agent 1 at 2. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 at 94. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 at 76. Allocate to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation strategy, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that each item is allocated to the agent who values it more, maximizing the overall valuation for each agent.
