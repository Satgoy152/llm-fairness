Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  54  39  89  84  12
1  72  27  79  13  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple method that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. We will assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Determine the highest value for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 72, Agent 0 values it at 54. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 39, Agent 1 values it at 27. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 89, Agent 1 values it at 79. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 values it at 13. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 values it at 15. Assign to Agent 1.

2. **Allocate items:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 4

3. **Ensure fairness:**
   - Each agent should receive at least one item. Adjust if necessary, but both agents have items already.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers maximizing the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.
