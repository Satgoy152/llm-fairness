Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  60  29  76  83  16
1  89  54  29  57  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "greedy" algorithm, where we allocate items one by one based on which agent values the item more.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 60 | 29 | 76 | 83 | 16 |
| 1            | 89 | 54 | 29 | 57 | 10 |

We will go through each item and allocate it to the agent who has the higher valuation for that item. If they have the same valuation for an item, we can allocate it to either agent.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (89 vs 60).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it more (54 vs 29).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it more (76 vs 29).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it more (83 vs 57).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it more (16 vs 10).

Based on these comparisons, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
