Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  28  66  81  98
1  86   6  42   8  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Hereâ€™s one approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item**: 
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 78, Agent 1 values it at 86.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 values it at 6.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 66, Agent 1 values it at 42.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 81, Agent 1 values it at 8.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 15.

2. **Allocate Items to Agents**:
   - **Agent 0**: We can allocate items that Agent 0 values significantly higher than Agent 1.
   - **Agent 1**: We can allocate items that Agent 1 values significantly higher than Agent 0.

3. **Consider the Total Value for Each Agent**:
   - Compare values item by item, and allocate each to the agent who values it higher, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

After analyzing the valuations, here's a potential allocation:

- Allocate items 0, 1, and 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation reflects a fair division based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 3 with values: 78, 28, and 81 respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4 with values: 42 and 15 respectively.

This ensures an integer allocation of items to each agent. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
