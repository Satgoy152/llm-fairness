Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  26   7  14  90
1  82   5  29   9  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82  5 29  9 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items such that their total valuation of the allocated items is as balanced as possible. Given the values:

```
Agent 0: 44, 26, 7, 14, 90
Agent 1: 82, 5, 29, 9, 25
```

We'll try to allocate the items such that the total value each agent receives is as equal as possible.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0 total: 44 + 26 + 7 + 14 + 90 = 181
- Agent 1 total: 82 + 5 + 29 + 9 + 25 = 150

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 4:** Highest value for agent 0 (90) and agent 1 (25). Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0:** Highest value for agent 1 (82) and second for agent 0 (44). Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** Value 29 for agent 1 and 7 for agent 0. Assign to Agent 1.
4. **Item 1:** Value 26 for agent 0 and 5 for agent 1. Assign to Agent 0.
5. **Item 3:** Value 14 for agent 0 and 9 for agent 1. Assign to Agent 0.

After allocation:

- Agent 0 has items: 4, 1, 3
  - Total value for Agent 0: 90 + 26 + 14 = 130

- Agent 1 has items: 0, 2
  - Total value for Agent 1: 82 + 29 = 111

Now, the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation is based on attempting to balance the values each agent gets as closely as possible.
