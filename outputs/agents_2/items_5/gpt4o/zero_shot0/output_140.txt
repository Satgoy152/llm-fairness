Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  56  92  33  94  75
1   8  37  36  72   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we can use the "maximum weight matching" approach for this small set of items and agents.

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values for items: [56, 92, 33, 94, 75]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values for items: [8, 37, 36, 72, 2]

To maximize fairness, we can aim to maximize the sum of values for each agent considering their highest preferences.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 3** has a high value for Agent 0, so allocate it to Agent 0.
- **Item 1** also has a high value for Agent 0, so allocate it to Agent 0.
- **Item 4** has a relatively high value for Agent 0, so allocate it to Agent 0.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items:

- **Item 2** and **Item 0** are left. Given the remaining items and their values:
  - For Agent 1, the best available items in terms of value are:
    - Item 2 (value 36)
    - Item 0 (value 8)

Now, based on this information, the allocations can be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the items they value most highly (1, 3, 4) and leaves Agent 1 with the best of the remaining items considering their preferences (0, 2).
