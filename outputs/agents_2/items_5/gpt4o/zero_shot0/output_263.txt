Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  18  65  77  32
1  12  98  94  27  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value. One approach is to use the "envy-free" allocation method, which tries to ensure that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's evaluate the given table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   78   |   18   |   65   |   77   |   32   |
|   1   |   12   |   98   |   94   |   27   |   72   |

To allocate items fairly:
- Agent 0 values Item 3 (77) and Item 0 (78) highly.
- Agent 1 values Item 1 (98) and Item 2 (94) highly.

We want to assign the items such that each agent gets a relatively high total value from their allocated items.

Allocations:
- Assign Item 0 and Item 3 to Agent 0 (total value: 78 + 77 = 155)
- Assign Item 1, Item 2, and Item 4 to Agent 1 (total value: 98 + 94 + 72 = 264)

The final allocation in JSON format is:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the values.
