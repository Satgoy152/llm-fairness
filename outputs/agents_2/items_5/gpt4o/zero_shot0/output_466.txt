Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  94  47  33  26
1  12  87  98  77  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that maximizes each agent's total valuation of their allocated items. We'll use a simple greedy algorithm to assign items to the agents based on their valuations:

1. List all the items and their corresponding valuations for each agent.
2. Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's apply this method to the given table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 91     | 94     | 47     | 33     | 26     |
| 1     | 12     | 87     | 98     | 77     | 27     |

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest (91 vs 12), so assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest (94 vs 87), so assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest (98 vs 47), so assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest (77 vs 33), so assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the highest (27 vs 26), so assign to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation, we ensure each agent receives an integer number of items:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1].
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 3, 4].

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
