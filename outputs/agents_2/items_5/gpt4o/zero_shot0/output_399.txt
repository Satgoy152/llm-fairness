Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  40  36  91   2
1  98  72  40  31  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value perceived by each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. The problem can be approached as an assignment problem, which can be solved using algorithms such as the Hungarian method. However, given the small size of the problem, we can manually determine a fair allocation.

Let's examine the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0: [70, 40, 36, 91, 2]
- Agent 1: [98, 72, 40, 31, 16]

We aim to allocate the items such that the perceived value for each agent is maximized.

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (91), and Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (98).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 and item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Next, Agent 0's second-highest value is for item 0 (70), but it's already taken. So, we move to the next highest available item, which is item 1 (40).
4. Agent 1's second-highest value item is item 1 (72), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
5. The remaining items are 2 and 4. Agent 0 values item 2 at 36 and item 4 at 2. Agent 1 values item 2 at 40 and item 4 at 16.
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (since 40 > 36), and item 4 to Agent 0 (since 2 is the only available value).

After making these allocations, the distribution is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, and 2

Accordingly, the JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
