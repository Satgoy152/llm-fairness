Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43   4  65  87  84
1  33  85  50  34  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that both agents receive an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the items based on the valuations provided:

- Agent 0's valuations: [43, 4, 65, 87, 84]
- Agent 1's valuations: [33, 85, 50, 34, 42]

The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent. One common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's allocate the items based on this criterion:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 values it at 33. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 values it at 85. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 values it at 50. Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 values it at 34. Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 values it at 42. Assign to Agent 0.

Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, 3, and 4. Agent 1 receives item 1. However, this allocation gives Agent 0 four items and Agent 1 only one, which may not seem fair.

Let's try another approach to ensure a fairer distribution of the number of items:

- Assign items with the highest difference in valuations to the agent with the higher valuation:
  - Item 1 (difference of 81 in favor of Agent 1), assign to Agent 1.
  - Item 3 (difference of 53 in favor of Agent 0), assign to Agent 0.

- For the remaining items, balance the distribution:
  - Item 0: Agent 0 (43) vs. Agent 1 (33) - assign to Agent 0.
  - Item 2: Agent 0 (65) vs. Agent 1 (50) - assign to Agent 0.
  - Item 4: Agent 0 (84) vs. Agent 1 (42) - assign to Agent 0.

Given this allocation, it seems that Agent 0 still ends up with more items, which may not be ideal. Let's consider alternative allocations:

To ensure a fairer split in terms of item count, we can allocate as follows:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2, 4

This way, each agent gets an even number of items. Let's output this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
