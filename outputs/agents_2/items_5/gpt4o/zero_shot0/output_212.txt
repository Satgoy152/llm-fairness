Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  56   4  21  32
1  65  17  20  81   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction or value each agent gets from their allocated items. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 at 65, while Agent 0 values it at 15. It makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 1, as they value it more.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 at 56, while Agent 1 values it at 17. Agent 0 should receive this item.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 at 20, while Agent 0 values it at 4. Agent 1 should receive this item.

4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 at 81, while Agent 0 values it at 21. Agent 1 should receive this item.

5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 at 32, while Agent 1 values it at 4. Agent 0 should receive this item.

Now, we distribute the items based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 2, and 3.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
