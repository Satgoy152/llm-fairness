Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  79   5  96  27  79
1   4  53  66  16  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We will consider each agent's valuation for each item and try to allocate the items in a way that balances their overall satisfaction.

Let's list the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 5
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 27
  - Item 4: 79

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 53
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 16
  - Item 4: 96

We can form an allocation strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation. Here's one such allocation:

1. Agent 0 should receive items that they value highly compared to Agent 1.
2. Agent 1 should receive items that they value highly compared to Agent 0.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 79, while Agent 1 values it at 4. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 5, while Agent 1 values it at 53. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 96, while Agent 1 values it at 66. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 27, while Agent 1 values it at 16. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 79, while Agent 1 values it at 96. Allocate to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences. 

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
