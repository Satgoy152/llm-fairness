Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  93  47  24  79
1  53  32  82  58  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we will consider the sum of the valuations each agent has for the items they receive. We will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent has for the items they receive, ensuring an integer allocation of items to each agent.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 3
- Item 1: 93
- Item 2: 47
- Item 3: 24
- Item 4: 79

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 53
- Item 1: 32
- Item 2: 82
- Item 3: 58
- Item 4: 29

We need to allocate 5 items between the 2 agents.

Let's start by examining which items each agent values most and aim for a balanced distribution:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations**: 
   - Item 1: 93
   - Item 4: 79
   - Item 2: 47

2. **Agent 1's highest valuations**:
   - Item 2: 82
   - Item 0: 53
   - Item 3: 58

Considering these priorities, we can make allocations such that each agent gets items they highly value while maintaining a balance:

- **Agent 0** receives items 1 and 4:
  - Total valuation for Agent 0 = 93 + 79 = 172

- **Agent 1** receives items 0, 2, and 3:
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 = 53 + 82 + 58 = 193

This allocation is fair in terms of giving each agent a collection of items they value highly. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
