Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  25  87  73  35   1
1  63  86  76  89  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider the sum of the valuations for each agent and try to distribute the items such that the total valuation is as balanced as possible between the two agents.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 25 + 87 + 73 + 35 + 1 = 221
- Agent 1: 63 + 86 + 76 + 89 + 29 = 343

Next, we will allocate the items such that the difference in total valuation between the two agents is minimized. We can start by giving the items with the highest valuations to each agent based on their individual preferences:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 89).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 87).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 76).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 63).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (value 1).

Now, let's check the total valuations after this allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (87) + Item 4 (1) = 88
- Agent 1: Item 3 (89) + Item 2 (76) + Item 0 (63) = 228

This allocation results in Agent 1 having a higher total valuation, so we need to adjust to balance further. We can try reassigning item 0 to Agent 0 to see if this balances the allocation better:

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 89).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 87).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (value 76).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (value 25).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (value 29).

Now, let's check the total valuations again:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (87) + Item 0 (25) = 112
- Agent 1: Item 3 (89) + Item 2 (76) + Item 4 (29) = 194

This allocation is more balanced, though Agent 1 still has a higher valuation. Let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns items to each agent while considering their preferences and attempting to balance the total valuations between them.
