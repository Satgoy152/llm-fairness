Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  21  82  49  44
1  47  97  18  70  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 17 + 21 + 82 + 49 + 44 = 213
   - Agent 1: 47 + 97 + 18 + 70 + 49 = 281

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Individual Values**:

   Let's try to allocate items based on the maximum value for each agent:

   - **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (47 vs. 17).
   - **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it more (97 vs. 21).
   - **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it more (82 vs. 18).
   - **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it more (70 vs. 49).
   - **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it more (49 vs. 44).

   From this, we can initially allocate:

   - Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 3, and 4
   - Agent 0: Item 2

3. **Check for Fairness and Adjust**:

   We need to ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible, considering both agents should get a roughly equal total value from their allocated items.

   - **Agent 0**: Item 2 = 82
   - **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1, 3, and 4 = 47 + 97 + 70 + 49 = 263

   Since this allocation is not fair, we need to adjust:

   Re-evaluating, let's try:

   - **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3, 4
   - **Agent 1**: Items 0, 1

   This results in:

   - **Agent 0**: 82 + 49 + 44 = 175
   - **Agent 1**: 47 + 97 = 144

   This distribution is more balanced, but we can explore further to check if a more balanced option is possible.

   After reevaluation, the best balance is:

   - **Agent 0**: Items 0, 3, 4
   - **Agent 1**: Items 1, 2

   This gives:

   - **Agent 0**: 17 + 49 + 44 = 110
   - **Agent 1**: 97 + 18 = 115

   This allocation gives a reasonably fair distribution based on the valuations provided, so we will proceed with this allocation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
