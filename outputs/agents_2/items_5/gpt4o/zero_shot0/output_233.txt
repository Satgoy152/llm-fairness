Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43   7  29  75  73
1  55  40  15  20  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple method based on maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items. We'll consider the preferences of each agent and try to distribute the items in a way that gives each agent a reasonable share of the value.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 very highly (75), so we'll assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Next, Agent 0 values item 4 (73) significantly, so we'll assign item 4 to Agent 0.
   
   Remaining items: 0, 1, 2

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most, but it has already been allocated. The next highest valuation is for item 0 (55), so we'll assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Then, we'll assign item 1 to Agent 1 since it has a second-highest value (40).

   Remaining item: 2

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - The remaining item, 2, is valued more by Agent 0 (29) than by Agent 1 (15). Therefore, we'll allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
