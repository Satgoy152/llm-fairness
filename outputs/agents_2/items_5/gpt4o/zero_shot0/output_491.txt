Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  74  71  87  35
1  45  71   5  13  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total value that each agent receives based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **List the items' valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0: [43, 74, 71, 87, 35]
   - Agent 1: [45, 71, 5, 13, 57]

2. **Compare the valuations for each item:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values at 43, Agent 1 values at 45. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values at 74, Agent 1 values at 71. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values at 71, Agent 1 values at 5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values at 87, Agent 1 values at 13. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values at 35, Agent 1 values at 57. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Check if this allocation gives each agent an integer number of items:**

   - Agent 0 receives items: [1, 2, 3]
   - Agent 1 receives items: [0, 4]

4. **Resulting allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
