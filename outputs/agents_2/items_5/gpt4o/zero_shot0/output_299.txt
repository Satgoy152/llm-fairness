Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  61  40  92  54
1  74  73  37   5  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 40
  - Item 3: 92
  - Item 4: 54

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 3: 5
  - Item 4: 84

We'll allocate items to each agent by considering the highest value each agent assigns to the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 93, while Agent 1 values it at 74. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 61, while Agent 1 values it at 73. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 40, while Agent 1 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 92, while Agent 1 values it at 5. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 54, while Agent 1 values it at 84. Allocate to Agent 1.

Allocations:
- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 4

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
