Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  14   8  95  33
1  30  37  63  29  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One common criterion for fairness is to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Given the valuations provided, we will strive to allocate items so that each agent achieves a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

- Agent 0's valuations: [70, 14, 8, 95, 33]
- Agent 1's valuations: [30, 37, 63, 29, 16]

We can try a fair allocation by assigning items based on maximizing the value each agent perceives:

1. Allocate item 3 to agent 0 because it has the highest valuation for agent 0 (95).
2. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 because it has the highest valuation for agent 1 (63).
3. Allocate item 0 to agent 0 because it is the next highest valuation (70) that is not yet considered.
4. Allocate item 1 to agent 1 because it is the next highest valuation (37) for agent 1.
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 0 because it is the next highest remaining valuation (33) for agent 0.

Now, each agent has the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]

This allocation strategy attempts to maximize the perceived value for each agent based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
