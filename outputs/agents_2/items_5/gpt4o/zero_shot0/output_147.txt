Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  46  50  93  86
1  89  80  85  61  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Given the table of valuations, we can use a simple allocation strategy to distribute the items optimally:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 92, and Agent 1 values it at 89. Allocate to Agent 0 since 92 is greater than 89.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 46, and Agent 1 values it at 80. Allocate to Agent 1 since 80 is greater than 46.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 50, and Agent 1 values it at 85. Allocate to Agent 1 since 85 is greater than 50.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 93, and Agent 1 values it at 61. Allocate to Agent 0 since 93 is greater than 61.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 86, and Agent 1 values it at 37. Allocate to Agent 0 since 86 is greater than 37.

Based on this analysis, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
