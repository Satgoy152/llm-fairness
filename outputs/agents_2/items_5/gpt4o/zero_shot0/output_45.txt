Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  33  59  16  79  92
1  76  53  27  50  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Let's analyze the values each agent assigns to the items:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 33
- Item 1: 59
- Item 2: 16
- Item 3: 79
- Item 4: 92

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 76
- Item 1: 53
- Item 2: 27
- Item 3: 50
- Item 4: 49

First, let's calculate the total value of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 33 + 59 + 16 + 79 + 92 = 279
- Agent 1: 76 + 53 + 27 + 50 + 49 = 255

Next, let's try to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as equal as possible.

### Allocation:

1. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
4. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
5. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (remaining item).

Let's check the total value each agent receives with this allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 3, 2] = 92 + 79 + 16 = 187
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1] = 76 + 53 = 129

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on the agents' valuations, ensuring each agent receives a balanced value of items.
