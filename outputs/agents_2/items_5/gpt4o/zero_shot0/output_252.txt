Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  43  89  54  44  54
1  83  62  71  82  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that considers the total value each agent places on the items they receive, attempting to maximize fairness based on their valuations. We seek an allocation in which the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's valuations: [43, 89, 54, 44, 54]
- Agent 1's valuations: [83, 62, 71, 82, 52]

Now, let's compute the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 43 + 89 + 54 + 44 + 54 = 284
- Total value for Agent 1: 83 + 62 + 71 + 82 + 52 = 350

Given these valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that both agents receive a similar total value. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Assign the most valuable item for Agent 0 first (item 1, value 89) and for Agent 1 (item 0, value 83).
2. Next, allocate the second most valuable items for each agent while balancing total values. For Agent 0, item 2 (value 54) and for Agent 1, item 3 (value 82).
3. Allocate the remaining items by considering which assignment results in a more balanced total value.

After fairly distributing the items, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 1, 2, and 4, and Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3. This allocation seeks to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.
