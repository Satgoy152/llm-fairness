Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  19  67  78   6
1  37  93  84  51  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [17, 19, 67, 78, 6]
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [37, 93, 84, 51, 26]

To maximize fairness, we can follow a strategy where each agent receives items that they value the most, ensuring that the overall satisfaction is maximized. We can start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent and then balance the allocation to ensure fairness.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (93), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (78), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Remaining items are 0, 2, and 4.

Now, let's assign the rest:

- **Agent 1** values item 2 second most (84), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** values item 0 second most (17), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- The only remaining item is item 4. Agent 0 values item 4 (6) more than Agent 1 (26), so assign item 4 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:

Agent 0: [0, 3]  
Agent 1: [1, 2, 4]

Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
