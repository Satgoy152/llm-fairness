Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  26  94   5  91  70
1  34  26  22  47  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. This is a simple form of the fair division problem. Let's allocate items based on maximizing the sum of values for each agent:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - For agent 0: 26 + 94 + 5 + 91 + 70 = 286
   - For agent 1: 34 + 26 + 22 + 47 + 17 = 146

2. Assign items to each agent by considering the highest value each agent places on the available items and attempting to maximize their satisfaction.

Let's allocate the items as follows:
- Agent 0 has higher total value for the items, so we will prioritize their higher value items.
- Agent 1 will receive items that Agent 0 values least.

Allocation:
- Agent 0 values items 1 and 3 highly (94 and 91), so assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 receives items based on what's remaining and their own values.

Let's finalize the allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 3]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 4]

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
