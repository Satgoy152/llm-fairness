Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  23  72  19  32  81
1  85  91  34  83  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. We will consider the total valuation each agent places on all items and try to balance their satisfaction as evenly as possible.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 23 + 72 + 19 + 32 + 81 = 227
- Agent 1's total valuation: 85 + 91 + 34 + 83 + 78 = 371

Next, we can allocate items by maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will aim to distribute the items such that both agents receive a fair share of the total valuation.

To achieve this, we can start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent based on their respective valuations:

1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (91), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
2. Next, for Agent 0, the highest remaining valued item is item 4 (81), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 0 (85), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 0's next highest valued item is item 3 (32), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Finally, the remaining item 2 is allocated to Agent 0 since they have a higher relative valuation for it.

After this allocation:

- Agent 0 has items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 has items 0 and 1.

Here is the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
