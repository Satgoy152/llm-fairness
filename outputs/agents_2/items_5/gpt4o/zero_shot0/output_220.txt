Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2  10  59  69  46
1  22  73  16  20  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to ensure that both agents are satisfied with their allocations as much as possible. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free" criterion or the "Max-Min Fair Share" (MMS), but in this simple case with only two agents, we can aim for a balanced allocation in terms of total value.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 2 + 10 + 59 + 69 + 46 = 186
- Agent 1's total value: 22 + 73 + 16 + 20 + 76 = 207

Now, let's try to allocate the items to balance the total valuation for each agent as evenly as possible:

1. Agent 1 highly values items 1 (73) and 4 (76), so we can start by allocating those to them.
2. Agent 0 highly values items 2 (59) and 3 (69), so we can allocate those to them.
3. This leaves item 0 to be allocated.

Allocating the items:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
  - Total value for Agent 0: 59 + 69 = 128
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
  - Total value for Agent 1: 73 + 76 = 149

Now, we need to allocate item 0. Agent 1 values item 0 more than Agent 0:

- If we allocate item 0 to Agent 0:
  - Agent 0: 59 + 69 + 2 = 130
  - Agent 1: 73 + 76 = 149

- If we allocate item 0 to Agent 1:
  - Agent 0: 59 + 69 = 128
  - Agent 1: 73 + 76 + 22 = 171

To balance the total valuations, let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 3
  - Total value for Agent 0: 2 + 59 + 69 = 130
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
  - Total value for Agent 1: 73 + 76 = 149

This allocation is reasonably balanced considering the total valuations and items. Here's the JSON output for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
