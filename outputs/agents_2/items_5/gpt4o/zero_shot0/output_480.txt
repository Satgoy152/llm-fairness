Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  84  82  72  40
1  66  68  16  59  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuation:**
   - Item 0: 78
   - Item 1: 84
   - Item 2: 82
   - Item 3: 72
   - Item 4: 40

2. **Agent 1's Valuation:**
   - Item 0: 66
   - Item 1: 68
   - Item 2: 16
   - Item 3: 59
   - Item 4: 68

We can allocate items to maximize the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest, followed by Item 2, Item 0, Item 3, and then Item 4.
- Agent 1 values Item 4 the highest, followed by Item 1, Item 0, Item 3, and then Item 2.

A fair and efficient allocation could be:
- Assign Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1, Item 3, and Item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation considers the highest values for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with an integer number of items and respects their highest preferences as much as possible.
