Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   2   8  78  51  93
1  77  97  92  33   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One common method to achieve this is by using the "maximum sum" approach, where we assign items to agents based on the highest value they have for those items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 2
- Item 1: 8
- Item 2: 78
- Item 3: 51
- Item 4: 93

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 77
- Item 1: 97
- Item 2: 92
- Item 3: 33
- Item 4: 0

To allocate fairly, we can follow these steps:
1. Compare the values of each item for both agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.

Based on the valuations:
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (77 vs 2).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (97 vs 8).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (92 vs 78).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (51 vs 33).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it more (93 vs 0).

Thus, the allocation is:
- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 1, and 2.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
