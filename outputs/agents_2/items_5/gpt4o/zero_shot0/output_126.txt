Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  45  71  87  53  70
1  42  85  77  61  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value based on their valuations. One common method to achieve this is to use the "maximin" approach or similar allocation strategies that ensure fairness.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(45 + 71 + 87 + 53 + 70 = 326\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(42 + 85 + 77 + 61 + 45 = 310\)

Now, we will allocate items to each agent to ensure a fair distribution of the total value, focusing on maximizing each agent's satisfaction given their valuations.

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (87), so we can allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (85), so we can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Next, Agent 0 values item 4 at 70, which is relatively high, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 1 values item 3 at 61, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
5. Finally, Agent 0 values item 0 at 45, and Agent 1 values it at 42. It's a close call, but to balance the number of items, we can give item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 0 already received two higher-valued items.

This allocation distributes the items as follows:

- Agent 0 has items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 has items 0, 1, and 3.

Expressing this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
