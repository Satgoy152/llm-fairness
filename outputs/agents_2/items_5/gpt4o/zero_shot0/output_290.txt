Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  53  87  62  93
1  29  33  53  55  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. One common method is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of the values for each agent. This can be done using an algorithm like the Hungarian algorithm or by heuristic methods to ensure a fair division.

Let's consider the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: 85, 53, 87, 62, 93
Agent 1: 29, 33, 53, 55, 36
```

We will assign the items to the agents such that the total valuation is maximized for each agent:

1. Compare the valuations for each item and allocate the item to the agent who values it more.

Using this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 85, and Agent 1 values it at 29. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 53, and Agent 1 values it at 33. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 87, and Agent 1 values it at 53. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 62, and Agent 1 values it at 55. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 93, and Agent 1 values it at 36. Allocate to Agent 0.

As a result, all items should be allocated to Agent 0 based on the given values because Agent 0 has a higher valuation for every item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total value for Agent 0 is maximized based on the given valuations.
