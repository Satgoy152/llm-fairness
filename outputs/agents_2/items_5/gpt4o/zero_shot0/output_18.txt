Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   5  32  61  57  13
1  42  10  50   6  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents given their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value received by each agent. Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and then try to allocate items such that each agent's share is as fair as possible.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent
- **Agent 0**: 5 (Item 0) + 32 (Item 1) + 61 (Item 2) + 57 (Item 3) + 13 (Item 4) = 168
- **Agent 1**: 42 (Item 0) + 10 (Item 1) + 50 (Item 2) + 6 (Item 3) + 86 (Item 4) = 194

### Step 2: Allocate Items
To make the allocation as fair as possible, we can try to balance the total valuations of the items each agent receives.

1. **Allocate items based on highest preference:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 2 (61).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 4 (86).

2. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Agent 0 will take Item 3 (57) as it is the next highest value (after Item 2) for Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 will take Item 0 (42) as it offers significant value for Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 will take Item 1 (32) as it has the next highest valuation after the previously allocated items.

3. **Check if any items are left:**
   - All items are allocated.

### Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3, 1
- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 0

### JSON Format Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 1],
    "1": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the value each agent receives based on their individual preferences for the items.
