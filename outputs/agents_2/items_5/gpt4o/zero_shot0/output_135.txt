Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96   7  49  51   4
1  25  38  32  69  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the distribution is as balanced as possible based on their valuations. Let's look at each agent's total valuation for all items and try to distribute items such that both agents have nearly equal total valuations.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent would receive if they got all the items:

- Agent 0: 96 + 7 + 49 + 51 + 4 = 207
- Agent 1: 25 + 38 + 32 + 69 + 17 = 181

Now, let's try to allocate the items by looking at the valuations and finding a balance:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value: 96 vs. 25 for agent 1).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value: 51 vs. 69 for agent 1).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value: 7 vs. 38 for agent 1).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value: 49 vs. 32 for agent 1).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value: 4 vs. 17 for agent 1).

Now let's check the total valuations each agent receives with this allocation:

- Agent 0: 96 (item 0) + 49 (item 2) = 145
- Agent 1: 69 (item 3) + 38 (item 1) + 17 (item 4) = 124

This allocation is reasonably balanced given the constraints. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
