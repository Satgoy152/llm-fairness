Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  28  46  81  12  13
1  69  92  45  50  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [69 92 45 50 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. **List Each Agent's Total Valuation for Each Item:**  
   - Agent 0: [28, 46, 81, 12, 13]
   - Agent 1: [69, 92, 45, 50, 29]

2. **Calculate Total Value for Each Item Across All Agents:**  
   - Item 0: 28 (Agent 0) + 69 (Agent 1) = 97
   - Item 1: 46 (Agent 0) + 92 (Agent 1) = 138
   - Item 2: 81 (Agent 0) + 45 (Agent 1) = 126
   - Item 3: 12 (Agent 0) + 50 (Agent 1) = 62
   - Item 4: 13 (Agent 0) + 29 (Agent 1) = 42

3. **Consider Each Agent's Preference and Allocate Items:**
   - Allocate items based on highest value per agent while ensuring each gets an integer number of items.

4. **Allocate the Items:**
   - Agent 0's highest preference is for item 2 (81), followed by item 1 (46).
   - Agent 1's highest preference is for item 1 (92), followed by item 0 (69).

Given these preferences and ensuring a fair allocation, let's allocate items:

- **Agent 0** will receive items: 2, 3, 4
- **Agent 1** will receive items: 0, 1

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
