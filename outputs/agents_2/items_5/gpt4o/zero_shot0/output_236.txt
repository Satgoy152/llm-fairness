Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  50  90  39  22  74
1  78  60  34  15   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we should consider maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple approach to achieve a fair division is to alternate picking the highest valued item for each agent.

Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (90), so they should get Item 1.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest (78), so they should get Item 0.

2. **Reassess with Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 2, 3, and 4.
   - Agent 0's highest remaining value is Item 4 (74), followed by Item 0 which is already taken.
   - Agent 1's next highest value is Item 2 (34).

3. **Continue Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 can take Item 4, as Agent 1 prefers Item 2.
   - Agent 1 takes Item 2.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Now, only Item 3 is left.
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 22, while Agent 1 values it at 15.
   - Therefore, allocate Item 3 to Agent 0, as they have a higher valuation for it.

Now, let's present the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items, and each agent has been allocated items in a way that considers their valuations.
