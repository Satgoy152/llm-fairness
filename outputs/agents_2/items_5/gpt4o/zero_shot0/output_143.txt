Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  20  39  27  79  55
1  34  29  23  28   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest value difference between the agents for each item.

Let's calculate the value differences for each item and then allocate them accordingly:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values at 20
   - Agent 1 values at 34
   - Difference (Agent 1 - Agent 0) = 14

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values at 39
   - Agent 1 values at 29
   - Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) = 10

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values at 27
   - Agent 1 values at 23
   - Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) = 4

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values at 79
   - Agent 1 values at 28
   - Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) = 51

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values at 55
   - Agent 1 values at 1
   - Difference (Agent 0 - Agent 1) = 54

Now, let's allocate items based on maximizing total value for each agent:

- Agent 0 should get items that have a higher positive difference in their favor.
- Agent 1 should get items that have a higher positive difference in their favor.

Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1: Item 0

Therefore, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0]
}
```
