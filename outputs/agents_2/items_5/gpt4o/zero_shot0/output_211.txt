Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  59  98  65  70
1  21  61  36  93  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring an integer number of items for each. Here, we'll use a simple approach to allocate based on the highest value each agent places on the items.

First, let's evaluate the total value each agent gets for different allocations and choose the one that seems fairest:

Agent 0's valuations: [74, 59, 98, 65, 70]
Agent 1's valuations: [21, 61, 36, 93, 77]

One possible fair allocation is to assign items in a way that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the highest (98).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the highest (93).
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 (74 vs. 21).
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 (77 vs. 70).
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 (61 vs. 59).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 3, and 4.

This allocation is intended to balance the total valuations each agent receives and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
