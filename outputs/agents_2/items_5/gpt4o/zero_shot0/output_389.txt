Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  76  77  38  15
1  65   3  24  97  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the preferences indicated by their valuations. We aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 77
  - Item 3: 38
  - Item 4: 15

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 24
  - Item 3: 97
  - Item 4: 31

To achieve a fair allocation, we should consider both the highest individual valuations and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives. 

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 1 has a high valuation for Item 3 (97). It's reasonable to allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 has high valuations for Items 1 (76) and 2 (77). It's reasonable to allocate Items 1 and 2 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 1 also values Item 0 highly (65), whereas Agent 0 values it less (36). So, we allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
4. Finally, Item 4 is valued moderately by both agents, but Agent 1 values it (31) more than Agent 0 (15). Therefore, we allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

Based on this reasoning, the fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and reflects their respective valuations fairly.
