Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  66  61  22  91  61
1  27  94  16  62  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27 94 16 62 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. This approach is known as maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [66, 61, 22, 91, 61]
- Agent 1: [27, 94, 16, 62, 83]

We can use a simple greedy algorithm to assign items to agents based on their highest preference, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

1. Allocate each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Check if each agent ends up with an integer count of items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it at 66, and Agent 1 values it at 27. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 61, and Agent 1 values it at 94. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 22, and Agent 1 values it at 16. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 91, and Agent 1 values it at 62. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it at 61, and Agent 1 values it at 83. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and tries to maximize the value each receives.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```
