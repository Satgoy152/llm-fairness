Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77   6  81   6  11
1  66  88  83  55  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [66 88 83 55 24]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Let's analyze the valuations and decide on an allocation:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 3: 6
  - Item 4: 11

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 55
  - Item 4: 24

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 2** has the highest combined value (81 for Agent 0 and 83 for Agent 1). It is relatively more valuable to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 1 (88 vs. 6 for Agent 0).
3. **Item 0** is more valuable to Agent 0 (77 vs. 66 for Agent 1).
4. **Item 3** is more valuable to Agent 1 (55 vs. 6 for Agent 0).
5. **Item 4** is more valuable to Agent 1 (24 vs. 11 for Agent 0).

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 77
- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 83
  - Item 3: 55
  - Item 4: 24

This allocation gives Agent 0 the item with the highest value to them, while Agent 1 receives the remaining items which collectively provide them higher value.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and attempts to maximize each agent's total value based on their preferences.
