Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  95  42  96  97
1  30  72  46  73  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. This can be done by considering each agent's preference for the items and ensuring that both agents receive an integer number of items.

Let's calculate the total values for each possible allocation:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 70
- Item 1: 95
- Item 2: 42
- Item 3: 96
- Item 4: 97

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 30
- Item 1: 72
- Item 2: 46
- Item 3: 73
- Item 4: 32

We will allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution. A common approach is to allocate items one by one based on the highest remaining value difference for each agent. Let's proceed with this step-by-step:

1. Compare the value differences for each item between the two agents:
   - Item 0: 70 (Agent 0) - 30 (Agent 1) = 40
   - Item 1: 95 (Agent 0) - 72 (Agent 1) = 23
   - Item 2: 42 (Agent 0) - 46 (Agent 1) = -4
   - Item 3: 96 (Agent 0) - 73 (Agent 1) = 23
   - Item 4: 97 (Agent 0) - 32 (Agent 1) = 65

2. Allocate items based on the highest positive difference favoring Agent 0:
   - Item 4 has the highest positive difference of 65. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Item 0 has the next highest positive difference of 40. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 and Item 3 both have a difference of 23. Allocate one to Agent 0 and one to Agent 1 to balance allocations. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 and Item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Item 2 has a negative difference of -4, meaning Agent 1 values it more. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, each agent has received 2 items:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 4
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
