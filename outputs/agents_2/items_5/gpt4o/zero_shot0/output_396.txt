Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  45  90  73  64
1  28  80  91  88  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the "maximum sum allocation" approach, which aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Item:**
   - For item 0: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 values it at 28.
   - For item 1: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 80.
   - For item 2: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 values it at 91.
   - For item 3: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 values it at 88.
   - For item 4: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 values it at 11.

2. **Assign Each Item to the Agent Who Values It More:**
   - Item 0: Assign to Agent 0 (58 > 28)
   - Item 1: Assign to Agent 1 (80 > 45)
   - Item 2: Assign to Agent 1 (91 > 90)
   - Item 3: Assign to Agent 1 (88 > 73)
   - Item 4: Assign to Agent 0 (64 > 11)

3. **Ensure Fair Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [0, 4].
   - Agent 1 gets items [1, 2, 3].

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and it maximizes the total valuation for each agent given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
