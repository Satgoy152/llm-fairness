Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  38  76  95  41
1   7  26  49  88  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [49, 38, 76, 95, 41]
- Agent 1's valuations: [7, 26, 49, 88, 21]

One approach to fairly allocate these items is to use the concept of maximizing the total value received by each agent considering their preferences. We can do this by assigning items to the agent who values them the most. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 7
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 38
   - Agent 1 values it at 26
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 76
   - Agent 1 values it at 49
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 95
   - Agent 1 values it at 88
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 41
   - Agent 1 values it at 21
   - Allocate to Agent 0

Based on this allocation, Agent 0 receives all the items, which leaves Agent 1 with nothing. To ensure a fair allocation and that both agents receive some items, we need to adjust. Let's allocate based on maximizing the fairness by swapping some items:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (high value for Agent 1)
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1)

The adjusted allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation allows each agent to receive an integer number of items while considering their valuations.
