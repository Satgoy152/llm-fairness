Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  88  69  27  94
1  73  35  83  42  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Here is a possible approach to achieve this:

1. List all the valuations for both agents.
2. Assign items one by one, starting with the highest valuation, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items by the end.

Given the matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  17  88  69  27  94
1  73  35  83  42  26
```

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 94. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Agent 0 next values item 1 at 88. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most at 83. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 2 next at 69, but it's already taken. Move to the next highest, item 0 at 17. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 at 73, but it's taken. Move to the next highest, item 3 at 42. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

Now all items are assigned, and each agent has an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
