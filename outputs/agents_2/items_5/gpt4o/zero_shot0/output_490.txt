Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  86   9  59  29  72
1   9  74  44  37  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 74 44 37 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will try to balance the overall satisfaction considering their valuations.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (86), so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (74), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. For item 2, agent 0 has a higher valuation (59) than agent 1 (44), so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.
4. For item 3, agent 1 has a higher valuation (37) than agent 0 (29), so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
5. For item 4, agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation (72) than agent 1 (71), so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.

This allocation aims to maximize the satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring both agents get an integer number of items, resulting in a fair division.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
