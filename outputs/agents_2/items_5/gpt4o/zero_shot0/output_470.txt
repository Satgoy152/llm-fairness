Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  36  19  62  43  85
1  78  29  74  74  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives. One simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 values it at 78.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 values it at 29.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 74.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 values it at 74.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 85, Agent 1 values it at 63.

Using a greedy allocation method:

1. Item 0 should go to Agent 1 (78 > 36).
2. Item 1 should go to Agent 1 (29 > 19).
3. Item 2 should go to Agent 1 (74 > 62).
4. Item 3 should go to Agent 1 (74 > 43).
5. Item 4 should go to Agent 0 (85 > 63).

This allocation is heavily skewed towards Agent 1. To ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to adjust. Let's consider the total valuation:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 36 + 19 + 62 + 43 + 85 = 245
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 78 + 29 + 74 + 74 + 63 = 318

To balance it slightly and ensure each agent gets at least two items, we can adjust the allocation:

Revised allocation:
- Item 4 should go to Agent 0.
- Reassign another item where Agent 0's valuation is closer to Agent 1's valuation.

One possible revised allocation is:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (62 is closer to 74 than other differences).
  
Thus, a fair allocation could be:

Agent 0: Items [2, 4]  
Agent 1: Items [0, 1, 3]

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
