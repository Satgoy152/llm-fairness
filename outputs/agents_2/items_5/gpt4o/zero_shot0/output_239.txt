Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  42  72  56   0  90
1   2  90  65  87  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
- Agent 0: 42 + 72 + 56 + 0 + 90 = 260
- Agent 1: 2 + 90 + 65 + 87 + 81 = 325

Given that Agent 1 has higher overall valuations, it might be sensible to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction. A possible approach is to allocate items based on which agent values them more, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 values it at 2. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 values it at 90. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 values it at 65. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 0, Agent 1 values it at 87. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 values it at 81. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets 2 or 3 items, and the allocation is based on maximizing valuations. 

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
