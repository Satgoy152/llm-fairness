Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  93  40  27  44
1  48  75  63   2  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that both agents receive an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

We have the following valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 55
- Item 1: 93
- Item 2: 40
- Item 3: 27
- Item 4: 44

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 48
- Item 1: 75
- Item 2: 63
- Item 3: 2
- Item 4: 81

A possible allocation strategy is to assign items to the agents in such a way that the allocation maximizes the satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0: Both agents have similar valuations for this item, but Agent 0 values it slightly higher.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0: Agent 0 values this item the most among all items.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1: Agent 1 values this item significantly more than Agent 0.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0: Agent 0 has a higher valuation for this item.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1: Agent 1 values this item the most among his options.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
``` 

In this allocation, both agents receive two or three items, ensuring a fair distribution based on their valuations.
