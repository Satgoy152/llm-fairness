Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  30  17  26  33
1  63  85  49   5  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and aim to maximize the satisfaction for both agents while ensuring each gets an integer number of items. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that both agents end up with an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate each item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 97, and Agent 1 values it at 63. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 30, and Agent 1 values it at 85. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 17, and Agent 1 values it at 49. Assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 26, and Agent 1 values it at 5. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 33, and Agent 1 values it at 72. Assign to Agent 1.

Thus, items are allocated as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, and 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
