Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  27  93  88  30
1  79  27  29  46  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 88 + 27 + 93 + 88 + 30 = 326
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 79 + 27 + 29 + 46 + 34 = 215

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Valuation:**
   - Start by allocating each item to the agent who values it more.

    - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 88, and Agent 1 values it at 79. Allocate to Agent 0.
    - Item 1: Both agents value it equally at 27, but since Agent 0 has a higher total valuation, allocate to Agent 1 for fairness.
    - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 93, and Agent 1 values it at 29. Allocate to Agent 0.
    - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 88, and Agent 1 values it at 46. Allocate to Agent 0.
    - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 30, and Agent 1 values it at 34. Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Resulting Allocation:**
   The allocation based on the above steps is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents get an integer number of items and attempts to fairly distribute the items based on their valuations.
