Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  88  57  57  53  25
1  73  94  86  52   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [73 94 86 52  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use the strategy of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that both agents receive a fair distribution of items.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [88, 57, 57, 53, 25]
- Agent 1 values: [73, 94, 86, 52, 8]

Now, we will assign each item to the agent that values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 88, while Agent 1 values it at 73. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 94. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 86. Assign to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 53, while Agent 1 values it at 52. Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 25, while Agent 1 values it at 8. Assign to Agent 0.

The allocations based on the above analysis are:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2]

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
