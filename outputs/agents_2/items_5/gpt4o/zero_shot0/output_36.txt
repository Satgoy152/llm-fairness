Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74   0  12  23   5
1  55  88  14  89  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent according to their valuation table. Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value items for each agent:** We will assign items based on which agent has a higher valuation for each item.

2. **Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:** Since there are 5 items and 2 agents, one agent will receive 3 items and the other will receive 2 items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 23
  - Item 4: 5

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 14
  - Item 3: 89
  - Item 4: 69

**Allocation strategy:**

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the higher valuation.
3. Adjust to ensure one agent receives 3 items and the other 2.

**Comparison and Assignment:**

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it higher (74 vs. 55). Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher (88 vs. 0). Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it higher (14 vs. 12). Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it higher (89 vs. 23). Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it higher (69 vs. 5). Assign to Agent 1.

**Initial Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 3, 4]

**Adjustment for fairness:**
- Agent 0 must receive 2 more items and Agent 1 must give up 2 items.
- Re-evaluate based on relatively lower valued items for Agent 1.

Reassign items to ensure fairness:
- Move Item 3 to Agent 0 since it's less valuable for Agent 0 than Items 2 and 4 are for Agent 1.

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 4]

Given these allocations, the JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing their valuations.
