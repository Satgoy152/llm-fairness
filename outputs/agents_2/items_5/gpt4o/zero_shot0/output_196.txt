Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  51  10  56  27  21
1  18  27  89   4  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [18 27 89  4 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, taking into account the agents' respective valuations for each item. A common approach to achieve fairness is to use the concept of maximizing the Nash Social Welfare, which seeks a balance between efficiency and fairness by maximizing the product of the agents' utilities.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [51, 10, 56, 27, 21]
- Agent 1 values: [18, 27, 89, 4, 97]

We need to allocate all 5 items (0 through 4) to these 2 agents. 

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign items to the agent who values them higher.
2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 at 18. Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 10, Agent 1 at 27. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 at 89. Assign to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 at 4. Assign to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 at 97. Assign to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
Agent 1: Items [1, 2, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least two items, and the allocation is fair based on the given valuations.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
