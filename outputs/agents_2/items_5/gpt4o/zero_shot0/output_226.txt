Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  85  14  18  49  28
1  59  88  74  93  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's valuations for the items they receive, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the values for each item for both agents, we can proceed with the allocation.

First, let's list the valuations for clarity:

- Agent 0: [85, 14, 18, 49, 28]
- Agent 1: [59, 88, 74, 93, 44]

A fair approach would be to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences. Let's evaluate each item:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 85
   - Agent 1 values it at 59
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 14
   - Agent 1 values it at 88
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 18
   - Agent 1 values it at 74
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 1 values it at 93
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 28
   - Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

Let's ensure each agent has at least one item. Currently, the allocation gives all items except one to Agent 1. To balance it a bit more, we could consider reallocating one item in a way that fairly distributes the total valuation. Since Agent 0 has the highest value for item 0, weâ€™ll leave that allocation as is. We can give one more item to Agent 0 for fairness in distribution:

Let's adjust by giving Item 4 to Agent 0, which is the next highest value Agent 0 has compared to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 4]
- Agent 1 gets items: [1, 2, 3]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
