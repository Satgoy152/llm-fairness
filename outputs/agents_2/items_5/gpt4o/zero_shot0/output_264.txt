Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  42  71  26  74
1   8  29  48  43  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to look for an allocation that considers the agents' valuations and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations for items:
- Item 0: 62
- Item 1: 42
- Item 2: 71
- Item 3: 26
- Item 4: 74

Agent 1's valuations for items:
- Item 0: 8
- Item 1: 29
- Item 2: 48
- Item 3: 43
- Item 4: 88

We will aim to allocate the items such that the total value for each agent is maximized according to their individual valuations.

One possible way to allocate the items is:

1. Assign items with a higher value for a specific agent to that agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items (in this case, 2 for one and 3 for the other, as there are 5 items total).

Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.

This allocation yields the following total valuations:
- Agent 0: 62 (Item 0) + 71 (Item 2) + 74 (Item 4) = 207
- Agent 1: 29 (Item 1) + 43 (Item 3) = 72

This allocation ensures that Agent 0, who has higher valuations for most items, receives the items they value more, while Agent 1 receives items that are relatively more valuable to them.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
