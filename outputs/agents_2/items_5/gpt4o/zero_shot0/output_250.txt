Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  18  19   9  77
1  82  65  27  46  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Determine the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all the items. This will help give a sense of how much each agent values the items overall.

   - Agent 0 total valuation: 81 + 18 + 19 + 9 + 77 = 204
   - Agent 1 total valuation: 82 + 65 + 27 + 46 + 87 = 307

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Valuation**: Allocate items in a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

3. **Consider Fairness**: Ideally, each agent should end up with a similar proportion of their maximum possible valuation.

Given the valuations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest, followed by item 4. 
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest, followed by item 0.

To achieve a fair distribution:

- Allocate items with high valuations for each agent, ensuring both get a reasonable share.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 2
- **Agent 1**: Items 1, 3, 4

This allocation provides a balance wherein each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while ensuring that all items are distributed.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
