Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  15  91  62   0  48
1  29  79  20  84  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. This approach ensures that the allocation is as fair as possible based on the given valuations.

Here's the breakdown of the allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 15
   - Item 1: 91
   - Item 2: 62
   - Item 3: 0
   - Item 4: 48

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 29
   - Item 1: 79
   - Item 2: 20
   - Item 3: 84
   - Item 4: 75

**Allocation Strategy:**
- Assign items in a way that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, aiming to maximize the sum of values for each agent.

**Allocation:**
- Agent 0 values Item 1 highly (91) compared to Agent 1 (79), so allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values Item 3 highly (84) compared to Agent 0 (0), so allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Next, Agent 0 values Item 2 (62) higher than Agent 1 (20), so allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values Item 4 (75) higher than Agent 0 (48), so allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.
- Finally, Item 0 is left, and Agent 1 values it (29) higher than Agent 0 (15), so allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4, 0]
}
```
