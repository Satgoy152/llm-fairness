Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  10  85  37  70  79
1  17  84  99  27  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations from the table, we can attempt to allocate the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  Item 0: 10, Item 1: 85, Item 2: 37, Item 3: 70, Item 4: 79  
- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  Item 0: 17, Item 1: 84, Item 2: 99, Item 3: 27, Item 4: 23  

A straightforward approach is to allocate items based on which agent values them more, while ensuring a fair distribution of the total number of items (5 items need to be distributed).

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 10  
   - Agent 1 values it at 17  
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 85  
   - Agent 1 values it at 84  
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation)

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 37  
   - Agent 1 values it at 99  
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation)

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 70  
   - Agent 1 values it at 27  
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation)

5. **Item 4**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 79  
   - Agent 1 values it at 23  
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation)

After allocation based on valuations, we have: 

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 2]

This allocation gives Agent 0 three items and Agent 1 two items, which satisfies the condition of integer allocation while maximizing the value for each agent based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
