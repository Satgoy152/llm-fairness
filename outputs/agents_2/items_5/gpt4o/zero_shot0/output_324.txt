Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  19   3  49   3  63
1  16  75  28  62  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Given the valuations, one approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the items, ensuring each agent receives a similar number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [19, 3, 49, 3, 63]
- Agent 1: [16, 75, 28, 62, 70]

We aim to allocate all 5 items: 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent:
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 63, and Agent 1 values it at 70. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 3, and Agent 1 values it at 75. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 3, and Agent 1 values it at 62. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 49, and Agent 1 values it at 28. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 19, and Agent 1 values it at 16. Allocate to Agent 0.

2. Verify the allocation:
   - Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2, with total valuations of 19 + 49 = 68.
   - Agent 1 gets items 1, 3, and 4, with total valuations of 75 + 62 + 70 = 207.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the allocation respects the valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
