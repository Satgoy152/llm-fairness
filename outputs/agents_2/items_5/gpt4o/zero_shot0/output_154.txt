Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  31  15   5  56  86
1  95  30  23  94  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, one approach is to maximize the total value received by each agent. This can be achieved by assigning items to agents such that the sum of the values of the items for each agent is as balanced as possible. 

Here's a step-by-step process for allocating the items:

1. List all items and their valuations for both agents.
2. Sort the items based on the difference in valuations between the two agents.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more, while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's analyze and allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 31, and Agent 1 values it at 95.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 15, and Agent 1 values it at 30.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 5, and Agent 1 values it at 23.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 56, and Agent 1 values it at 94.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 86, and Agent 1 values it at 66.

Let's sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations:

1. Item 0: Difference = |95 - 31| = 64
2. Item 3: Difference = |94 - 56| = 38
3. Item 4: Difference = |86 - 66| = 20
4. Item 1: Difference = |30 - 15| = 15
5. Item 2: Difference = |23 - 5| = 18

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents:

- Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1 (valuation: 95)
- Item 3: Allocate to Agent 1 (valuation: 94)
- Item 4: Allocate to Agent 0 (valuation: 86)
- Item 1: Allocate to Agent 1 (valuation: 30)
- Item 2: Allocate to Agent 0 (valuation: 5)

Now, Agent 0 has items [4, 2] and Agent 1 has items [0, 3, 1].

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 1]
}
```
