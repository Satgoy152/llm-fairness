Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77  37  17  92   2
1  60  80  38  94  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method like maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and ideally, we would like the allocations to be as balanced as possible in terms of total value. Here's one possible allocation:

- Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they receive each possible combination of items.
- Attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each receives a fair distribution of items.

Based on the given valuations, one possible allocation that balances the total value for both agents could be:

Agent 0 receives items: 0, 1, 2  
Agent 1 receives items: 3, 4 

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 77 + 37 + 17 = 131, and Agent 1 a total value of 94 + 59 = 153. It is a reasonable distribution based on the given valuations.
