Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  65  76  64  77  49
1  98  87  44  17  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 65 (Item 0) + 76 (Item 1) + 64 (Item 2) + 77 (Item 3) + 49 (Item 4) = 331
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 98 (Item 0) + 87 (Item 1) + 44 (Item 2) + 17 (Item 3) + 79 (Item 4) = 325

2. **Identify Item Preference:**
   - Compare the valuations for each item between agents to determine preference on a per-item basis.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign items to maximize individual agent satisfaction based on their preferences and ensure a fair allocation.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 65; Agent 1 values it at 98. 
  - Allocate to Agent 1.

- **Item 1:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 76; Agent 1 values it at 87.
  - Allocate to Agent 1.

- **Item 2:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 64; Agent 1 values it at 44.
  - Allocate to Agent 0.

- **Item 3:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 77; Agent 1 values it at 17.
  - Allocate to Agent 0.

- **Item 4:** 
  - Agent 0 values it at 49; Agent 1 values it at 79.
  - Allocate to Agent 1.

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 4

This allocation allows each agent to get an integer number of items and attempts to maximize their valuations fairly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
