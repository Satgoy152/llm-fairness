Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  47  45  90   8  19
1  70  64  46  91  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we should consider maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, we are looking for a fair division that can be perceived as equitable.

Let's assess the total valuations for each item by the agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 values it at 70
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 64
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 values it at 46
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 values it at 91
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 19, Agent 1 values it at 28

A reasonable goal is to allocate items to maximize the sum of values for each agent while ensuring a balanced distribution of total items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Item 0 should go to Agent 1, as 70 > 47.
2. Item 1 should go to Agent 1, as 64 > 45.
3. Item 2 should go to Agent 0, as 90 > 46.
4. Item 3 should go to Agent 1, as 91 > 8.
5. Item 4 should go to Agent 1, as 28 > 19.

This allocation gives Agent 0 one item (item 2) and Agent 1 four items (items 0, 1, 3, and 4). However, to balance the number of items each agent receives, we can reconsider:

- Reallocate item 2 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1, resulting in two items for each agent.

Therefore, a fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, and 4

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
