Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3  4
0   8  20  39  84  4
1  88  82  83  26  8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 8 + 20 + 39 + 84 + 4 = 155
   - Agent 1: 88 + 82 + 83 + 26 + 8 = 287

2. Compare the values and allocate items to balance the value each agent receives:
   - Agent 1 values the items much higher, so we will aim to give Agent 0 items that they value relatively highly compared to how Agent 1 values them.

3. Allocate the items:
   - Agent 0 gets items that they value more in comparison to Agent 1:
     - Item 3 (value 84 for Agent 0 vs. 26 for Agent 1)
     - Item 2 (value 39 for Agent 0 vs. 83 for Agent 1)
     - Item 0 (value 8 for Agent 0 vs. 88 for Agent 1)

   - Agent 1 gets items that they value much more than Agent 0:
     - Item 1 (value 82 for Agent 1 vs. 20 for Agent 0)
     - Item 4 (value 8 for Agent 1 vs. 4 for Agent 0)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the total value of items as fairly as possible given the agents' preferences.
