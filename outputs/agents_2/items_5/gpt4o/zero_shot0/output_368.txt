Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1  2   3   4
0   0  97  7  56  25
1  57  93  7  13  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive based on their valuations. We can use a method like the "maximum envy-free" allocation to ensure a fair distribution. 

Let's calculate:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:**
   - Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] -> [0, 97, 7, 56, 25]

2. **Agent 1's valuations:**
   - Items: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] -> [57, 93, 7, 13, 48]

Now, let's try to allocate the items by considering each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences (Descending Order):**
   - Item 1: 97
   - Item 3: 56
   - Item 4: 25
   - Item 2: 7
   - Item 0: 0

2. **Agent 1's Preferences (Descending Order):**
   - Item 1: 93
   - Item 0: 57
   - Item 4: 48
   - Item 2: 7
   - Item 3: 13

Let's allocate items considering the above preferences:

- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0** (highest value for Agent 0)
- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1** (highest value for Agent 1)
- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0** (second-highest value for Agent 0)
- **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1** (second-highest value for Agent 1)
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 or 1, but since both have the same value for it, we can allocate it to Agent 0 to balance the number of items.**

The allocations will be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 2],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences and ensures each agent receives some valuable items.
