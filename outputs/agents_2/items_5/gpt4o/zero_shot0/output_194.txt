Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  69  84  15  49  75
1  95  58  49  35  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total value each agent receives. This can be thought of as a type of "maximum sum" problem where we try to ensure each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(69 + 84 + 15 + 49 + 75 = 292\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(95 + 58 + 49 + 35 + 52 = 289\)

Next, we aim to assign items such that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Assign the highest value items first:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 84 for Agent 0 vs. 58 for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 95 for Agent 1 vs. 69 for Agent 0).

2. **Assign the next highest value items:**
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 75 for Agent 0 vs. 52 for Agent 1).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 49 for Agent 1 vs. 15 for Agent 0).

3. **Assign the remaining item:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 49 for Agent 0 vs. 35 for Agent 1).

### Final Allocation

After assigning the items based on the strategy above, the allocations are:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 4, 3].
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 2].

Now, in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
