Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  40  12  72  15  10
1  20  59   7  93  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. One approach is to use a greedy method, allocating each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's how we can allocate the items based on the given table:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value | Allocated to Agent |
|------|---------------|---------------|--------------------|
| 0    | 40            | 20            | 0                  |
| 1    | 12            | 59            | 1                  |
| 2    | 72            | 7             | 0                  |
| 3    | 15            | 93            | 1                  |
| 4    | 10            | 54            | 1                  |

From this allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 3, and 4.

Thus, the fair allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
