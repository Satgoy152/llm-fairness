Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53   6  65  30  94
1  46  42  61  32  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here are the steps we'll follow:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would get if they received all the items.
2. Use a method like the "Maximum Weighted Matching" or "Greedy Allocation" to distribute the items fairly.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 53
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 65
  - Item 3: 30
  - Item 4: 94
  - Total Value: 53 + 6 + 65 + 30 + 94 = 248

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 46
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 61
  - Item 3: 32
  - Item 4: 91
  - Total Value: 46 + 42 + 61 + 32 + 91 = 272

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize fairness:

1. Assign the item with the highest individual value to the agent who values it the most.
2. Continue this process for the remaining items.

Allocations:
- Item 4 (Value: 94 for Agent 0, 91 for Agent 1) -> Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2 (Value: 65 for Agent 0, 61 for Agent 1) -> Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 0 (Value: 53 for Agent 0, 46 for Agent 1) -> Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3 (Value: 30 for Agent 0, 32 for Agent 1) -> Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1 (Value: 6 for Agent 0, 42 for Agent 1) -> Assign to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

Each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 4, while Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3.
