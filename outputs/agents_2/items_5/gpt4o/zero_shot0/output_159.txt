Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  35  77  92  57
1  91  65  45  65  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Our goal is to maximize the satisfaction of both agents. One way to do this is by using a method similar to the "maximum sum" or "greedy" allocation method, where we assign items to the agent who values them the most.

Let's analyze the given table:

```
Agent 0:  1, 35, 77, 92, 57
Agent 1: 91, 65, 45, 65, 10
```

We will allocate each item to the agent who values it the highest:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 91, while Agent 0 values it at 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 65, while Agent 0 values it at 35. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 77, while Agent 1 values it at 45. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 92, while Agent 1 values it at 65. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 10. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation assigns three items to Agent 0 and two items to Agent 1, with each item going to the agent who values it the most.
