Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  92  20  18  54  53
1   2  91  87  67  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. Let's evaluate different allocations to see which one maximizes fairness.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [92, 20, 18, 54, 53]
Agent 1: [2, 91, 87, 67, 77]
```

A fair approach is to assign items in such a way that the difference in total valuation between the agents is minimized. One possible allocation strategy is to assign items based on maximizing each agent's value for the items they receive. 

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 92, while Agent 1 values it at 2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 20, while Agent 1 values it at 91. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 18, while Agent 1 values it at 87. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 54, while Agent 1 values it at 67. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 53, while Agent 1 values it at 77. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, Agent 0 receives one item, and Agent 1 receives four items. This allocation is weighted towards Agent 1 due to their higher valuations on more items, but it aims to maximize each agent's total perceived value.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and strives for a fair distribution of value based on their individual valuations.
