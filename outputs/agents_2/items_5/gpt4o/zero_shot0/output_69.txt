Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  80  70  56  27  87
1  74  33   3  95  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a set of items that maximizes their valuation while keeping the allocation balanced. Given the valuations provided in the table, we can employ a simple greedy algorithm to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. List all items with their respective valuations for each agent.
2. Sort these valuations in descending order.
3. Assign items to agents based on the sorted valuations, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each configuration:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4] = 80 + 70 + 87 = 237
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3] = 3 + 95 = 98

This configuration ensures that each agent receives a fair share of total valuation based on their preferences.

Now, let's allocate the items accordingly:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation assigns items to agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
