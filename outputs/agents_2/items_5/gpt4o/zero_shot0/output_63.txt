Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  62  86  31  99  77
1  92  57  59  60  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should consider the total valuation each agent places on the items and try to distribute the items so that both agents have similar total valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the Total Valuation for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 62 + 86 + 31 + 99 + 77 = 355
   - Agent 1: 92 + 57 + 59 + 60 + 60 = 328

2. **Allocate Items Based on Value:**

   We should allocate items in such a way that both agents have similar total valuations. Start by giving each agent the item that is most valuable to them and proceed from there.

3. **Allocation Process:**

   - Assign the highest valued item for each agent first:
     - Agent 0 values item 3 highest at 99.
     - Agent 1 values item 0 highest at 92.
   
   - Then assign the second-highest valued item that doesn't cause an imbalance:
     - Agent 0 also values item 1 highly at 86.
     - Agent 1 values item 2 next at 59.
     
   - Continue this process:
     - Agent 0 can take item 4 (77) without causing significant imbalance.
     - Agent 1 can take item 3 (60) and item 1 (57) to balance out.

4. **Final Allocation:**

   After considering all options, the best allocation to balance the values is:

   - Agent 0 receives items: 1, 3, 4
   - Agent 1 receives items: 0, 2

5. **JSON Format:**

   ```json
   {
       "0": [1, 3, 4],
       "1": [0, 2]
   }
   ```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent, considering their preferences and ensuring each gets a fair share of the total value of all items.
