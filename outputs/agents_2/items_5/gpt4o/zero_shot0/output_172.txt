Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  41  23  39  24   3
1  93  82  58  96  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Setup**: Consider the valuations as given in the table:

   - Agent 0: [41, 23, 39, 24, 3]
   - Agent 1: [93, 82, 58, 96, 49]

2. **Total Value Calculation**: Calculate the total valuations for each agent across all items:
   - Total for Agent 0: 41 + 23 + 39 + 24 + 3 = 130
   - Total for Agent 1: 93 + 82 + 58 + 96 + 49 = 378

3. **Fair Allocation Strategy**: Given that there are 5 items, and each agent should ideally get an integer number of items, we might consider starting by giving items that maximize each agent's individual total, while ensuring a fair distribution in terms of count.

4. **Allocation Process**:
   - **Agent 1**: Has significantly higher valuations across most items and should be prioritized for high-value items.
   - **Agent 0**: Should receive items where Agent 1's valuation is not overwhelmingly higher.

5. **Specific Allocation**:
   - Assign the highest valued items for Agent 1 first: Select items 0, 3, and 1 (valuations 93, 96, and 82 respectively).
   - Assign the remaining items to Agent 0: Items 2 and 4.

6. **Resulting Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets items 2 and 4.
   - Agent 1 gets items 0, 1, and 3.

The allocation ensures that each agent gets items that reflect their valuations as fairly as possible, given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
