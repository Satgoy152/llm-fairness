Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  55  26  96  56  73
1  64  96  93  10  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use the "greedy" method, where items are allocated based on the highest valuation difference between agents. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it more.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

| Item | Agent 0 Valuation | Agent 1 Valuation | Difference (Agent 1 - Agent 0) |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|--------------------------------|
| 0    | 55                | 64                | 9                              |
| 1    | 26                | 96                | 70                             |
| 2    | 96                | 93                | -3                             |
| 3    | 56                | 10                | -46                            |
| 4    | 73                | 33                | -40                            |

Now, allocate each item to the agent with the higher valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 1
- Item 1: Agent 1
- Item 2: Agent 0
- Item 3: Agent 0
- Item 4: Agent 0

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items: [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0, 1]

Now, represent these allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
