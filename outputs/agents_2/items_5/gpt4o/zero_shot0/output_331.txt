Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  77   7  28  80  56
1  96  14   5  48  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We'll aim to allocate items in such a way that each agent's total valuation is maximized based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [77, 7, 28, 80, 56]
- Agent 1 values: [96, 14, 5, 48, 45]

One potential approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 96, which is higher than Agent 0's 77.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 7, which is higher than Agent 1's 14.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 28, which is higher than Agent 1's 5.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 80, which is higher than Agent 1's 48.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 56, which is higher than Agent 1's 45.

However, this results in Agent 0 receiving four items and Agent 1 receiving only one. To ensure a fair allocation, we can adjust the allocation to balance the number of items:

1. Allocate high-value items to the respective agents.
2. Distribute remaining items to balance the number of items.

After re-evaluating to achieve a balanced allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (high value for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (high value for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1)
- Assign Items 1 and 2 to Agent 0 (remaining items)

This results in:

- Agent 0 gets items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 4

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their valuations, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
