Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  99  81  89  42
1  53   3  90  34  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items considering their preferences. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent.
2. Try to allocate items in a way that balances the total value received by each agent.

Here’s a step-by-step allocation process:

- Agent 0 has higher valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 has a significantly higher valuation for item 2.

Let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because they have a high valuation for it.
- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 because they have the highest valuations for these items compared to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 for a relatively high valuation.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 to balance the number of items.

Here’s the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation aims to provide a fair distribution based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
