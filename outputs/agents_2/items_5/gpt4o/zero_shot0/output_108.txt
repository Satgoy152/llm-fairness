Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44   9  67  54  61
1  71  52  95  31   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [71 52 95 31  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations table, we'll try to distribute the items in a way that balances the total valuations.

Here's the valuation table for clarity:

```
Agent 0: [44, 9, 67, 54, 61]
Agent 1: [71, 52, 95, 31, 8]
```

Let's evaluate different allocation strategies:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because it is their highest valuation (95), and it is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation (67).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because it is their second-highest valuation (71) and higher than Agent 0's valuation (44).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 because it is comparatively higher for Agent 0 (54 vs. 31).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because it is significantly more valued by Agent 0 (61 vs. 8).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because it is significantly more valued by Agent 1 (52 vs. 9).

After this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 3, 4
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 1, 2

This allocation tries to maximize the individual satisfaction for the given items. 

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
