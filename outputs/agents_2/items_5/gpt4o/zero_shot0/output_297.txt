Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  93  68  33  44  68
1  19  63  61  43  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to balance the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. Here's one approach to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 93 + 68 + 33 + 44 + 68 = 306
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 19 + 63 + 61 + 43 + 72 = 258

2. Start by allocating each item to the agent who values it more, then adjust to balance the total valuation.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Item 0 (Agent 0 values at 93, Agent 1 values at 19): Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 1 (Agent 0 values at 68, Agent 1 values at 63): Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 2 (Agent 0 values at 33, Agent 1 values at 61): Allocate to Agent 1
- Item 3 (Agent 0 values at 44, Agent 1 values at 43): Allocate to Agent 0
- Item 4 (Agent 0 values at 68, Agent 1 values at 72): Allocate to Agent 1

Now, let's calculate the total valuation each agent receives:

- Agent 0: 93 + 68 + 44 = 205
- Agent 1: 61 + 72 = 133

To further balance the allocations, we can swap item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1:

- Agent 0: 93 + 68 = 161
- Agent 1: 61 + 43 + 72 = 176

This distribution is closer to balancing the total valuation each agent receives. Therefore, the allocation of items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
