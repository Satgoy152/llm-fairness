Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   8  55  65  96  99
1  71  56  97  56  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for a distribution that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences. A common approach is to use the "Envy-Free" allocation method, where each agent receives items such that no agent prefers the other's allocation to their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [8, 55, 65, 96, 99]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [71, 56, 97, 56, 88]

To achieve a fair allocation, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 values it at 71.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 56.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 65, Agent 1 values it at 97.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 96, Agent 1 values it at 56.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 99, Agent 1 values it at 88.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a manner proportional to their valuations, making the distribution as fair as possible given the available data.
