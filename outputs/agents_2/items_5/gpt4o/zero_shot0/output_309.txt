Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  97  77  42  42  77
1  16  57  54  20  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items while trying to maximize fairness according to their valuations. 

1. **Agent 0's total valuation**: 97 + 77 + 42 + 42 + 77 = 335
2. **Agent 1's total valuation**: 16 + 57 + 54 + 20 + 93 = 240

The goal is to allocate items so that each agent gets an equitable share based on their valuations. Since there are 5 items, each agent should ideally get around 2 to 3 items.

Let's analyze the values for each item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 97, Agent 1 values it at 16. (Assigning to Agent 0)
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 57. (Assigning to Agent 0)
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 values it at 54. (Assigning to Agent 1)
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 values it at 20. (Assigning to Agent 0)
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 93. (Assigning to Agent 1)

After analyzing the valuations, a fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 4.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
