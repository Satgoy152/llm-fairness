Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  69  16  65  31
1  36  69   3  98  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes their satisfaction. Let's review the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [90, 69, 16, 65, 31]
Agent 1: [36, 69, 3, 98, 51]
```

We should aim to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Let's go through a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this item at 98, which is the highest valuation for this item. Allocating it to Agent 1 would significantly increase their total satisfaction.

2. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item at 90, which is the highest overall valuation for any item. Allocating it to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.

3. **Item 1**: Both agents value this item at 69. Since both have equal valuation, we can allocate this item to Agent 0 to balance the distribution, as Agent 0 currently has fewer items.

4. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item at 51, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 31. Allocating this item to Agent 1 increases their satisfaction.

5. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item at 16, while Agent 1 values it at 3. Allocating this item to Agent 0 increases their total valuation more than it would for Agent 1.

After considering the valuations and aiming for a fair distribution, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4]
}
```

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
