Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  38  72  65  49  10
1  74  37  50  78  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One reasonable approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items based on which agent values them more. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Compare the valuations of each item for the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.

Let's apply this process to the given valuations:

| Item | Agent 0 Value | Agent 1 Value |
|------|---------------|---------------|
| 0    | 38            | 74            |
| 1    | 72            | 37            |
| 2    | 65            | 50            |
| 3    | 49            | 78            |
| 4    | 10            | 76            |

- For item 0, Agent 1 values it higher (74 > 38), so assign it to Agent 1.
- For item 1, Agent 0 values it higher (72 > 37), so assign it to Agent 0.
- For item 2, Agent 0 values it higher (65 > 50), so assign it to Agent 0.
- For item 3, Agent 1 values it higher (78 > 49), so assign it to Agent 1.
- For item 4, Agent 1 values it higher (76 > 10), so assign it to Agent 1.

Following this allocation strategy, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a set of items that maximizes their total valuation based on individual preferences.
