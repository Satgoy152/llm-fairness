Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  90  67  84  51  58
1  69  60  73  15   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's start by looking at the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 67
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 51
  - Item 4: 58

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 69
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 15
  - Item 4: 4

A reasonable approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most.

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 90
   - Agent 1 values it at 69
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 67
   - Agent 1 values it at 60
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 84
   - Agent 1 values it at 73
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51
   - Agent 1 values it at 15
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 58
   - Agent 1 values it at 4
   - Allocate to Agent 0

Now, let's check if this is fair. Currently, all items are allocated to Agent 0, and none to Agent 1. To ensure fairness, we should consider allocating some items to Agent 1 to balance the distribution. 

Re-evaluating with a focus on fairness:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation for Agent 1).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (more fair as Agent 1 values it over others left).
- Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (more fair as Agent 1 values it over others left).

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3, 4

Here's the fair allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
