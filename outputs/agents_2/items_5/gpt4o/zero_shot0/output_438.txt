Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  95  14  43  24  25
1  26   3  64  43  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total value for each agent. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 43
  - Item 3: 24
  - Item 4: 25

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 64
  - Item 3: 43
  - Item 4: 87

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 values it at 26. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 values it at 3. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 43, Agent 1 values it at 64. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 24, Agent 1 values it at 43. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 values it at 87. Allocate to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation strategy, Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1, and Agent 1 gets items 2, 3, and 4.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
