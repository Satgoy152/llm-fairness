Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1  2   3   4
0  15  14  4  64  62
1  40  37  3  66  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We can use a strategy that finds an allocation maximizing the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they receive.

Let's evaluate the valuations for each item by both agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 15, Agent 1 at 40.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 at 37.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 at 3.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 at 66.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 at 53.

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize fairness:

1. Item 3 has the highest valuation for both agents. To balance, we assign it to Agent 1, who values it slightly higher.
2. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0 as they have a higher valuation for it.
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 as they value it notably higher than Agent 0.
4. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 as it balances the remaining value Agent 1 gets.
5. Item 2, which both agents value low, can be given to Agent 1 to balance the total number of items each agent receives.

Thus, the final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
