Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  91  78  49  60  32
1  39  83  91  53  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [39 83 91 53 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [91, 78, 49, 60, 32]
- Agent 1: [39, 83, 91, 53, 19]

We can follow an approach that assigns items based on the highest valuation difference for each item between the two agents. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 91, and Agent 1 values it at 39. The difference is 52, favoring Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 78, and Agent 1 values it at 83. The difference is 5, favoring Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 49, and Agent 1 values it at 91. The difference is 42, favoring Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 60, and Agent 1 values it at 53. The difference is 7, favoring Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 32, and Agent 1 values it at 19. The difference is 13, favoring Agent 0.

Based on the valuation differences and total number of items (5), we can allocate:

- Items 0, 3, and 4 to Agent 0.
- Items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
