Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  78  92  54  23  10
1  79  57  24  27  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to this allocation problem:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0 values: [78, 92, 54, 23, 10] 
   - Agent 1 values: [79, 57, 24, 27, 20]
   
2. **Sort Items by Difference in Value**:
   - Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents:
     - Item 0: 1 (79 - 78)
     - Item 1: -35 (57 - 92)
     - Item 2: -30 (24 - 54)
     - Item 3: 4 (27 - 23)
     - Item 4: 10 (20 - 10)

3. **Assign Items Based on Preference**:
   - Agent 0 prefers items with negative differences (where they value the item more).
   - Agent 1 prefers items with positive differences (where they value the item more).

4. **Allocate Items**:
   - Assign Item 1 and Item 2 to Agent 0 (negative differences).
   - Assign Item 0, Item 3, and Item 4 to Agent 1 (positive and smaller negative differences).

5. **Check Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 gets items [1, 2] with total value: 92 + 54 = 146
   - Agent 1 gets items [0, 3, 4] with total value: 79 + 27 + 20 = 126

Although this allocation doesn't maximize the total value for each agent equally, it is a reasonable attempt given the integer constraints and difference method.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
