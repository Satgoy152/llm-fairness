Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  30   6  85  46
1  90  16  16  50  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the satisfaction or total value for each agent. A common approach is to use an allocation method such as maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. In this case, we need to ensure both agents receive an integer number of items.

Let's consider each item's valuation for both agents and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 89, and Agent 1 values it at 90.  
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 30, and Agent 1 values it at 16.  
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

3. **Item 2**: Both agents value it at 6 and 16 respectively.  
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 85, and Agent 1 values it at 50.  
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value).

5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 46, and Agent 1 values it at 88.  
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value).

Based on the above allocations, each agent receives an integer number of items:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 4.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
