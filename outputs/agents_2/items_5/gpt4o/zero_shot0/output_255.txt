Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  72  95  87  94  12
1  77  74  43  15   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are assigned. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation:

### Agent Valuations:
- **Agent 0:** 
  - Item 0: 72
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 87
  - Item 3: 94
  - Item 4: 12

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 43
  - Item 3: 15
  - Item 4: 6

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Item 1 (95 for Agent 0, 74 for Agent 1):** Highest valuation overall is by Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. **Item 3 (94 for Agent 0, 15 for Agent 1):** Next highest valuation is by Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 0 (72 for Agent 0, 77 for Agent 1):** Highest valuation is by Agent 1. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. **Item 2 (87 for Agent 0, 43 for Agent 1):** Highest valuation is by Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4 (12 for Agent 0, 6 for Agent 1):** Highest valuation is by Agent 0. Allocate to Agent 0.

### Resulting Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Gets items 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- **Agent 1:** Gets item 0.

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and we maximize the total valuation each agent receives based on their preferences.
