Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  53  19  42  13  91
1  57  46  42  75  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm or optimization strategy to achieve this.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 53
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 13
  - Item 4: 91

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 75
  - Item 4: 14

We aim to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is maximized. Here's a reasonable allocation attempt:

1. Agent 0 receives items that they value highly and that agent 1 values relatively lower.
2. Agent 1 receives items that they value highly and that agent 0 values relatively lower.

Based on these principles, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0 (value 53 for agent 0, 57 for agent 1)
  - Item 4 (value 91 for agent 0, 14 for agent 1)

- Agent 1:
  - Item 1 (value 19 for agent 0, 46 for agent 1)
  - Item 2 (value 42 for both agents)
  - Item 3 (value 13 for agent 0, 75 for agent 1)

This allocation tries to balance the total valuations:

- Total value for Agent 0: 53 + 91 = 144
- Total value for Agent 1: 46 + 42 + 75 = 163

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items and attempts to maximize their respective valuations.
