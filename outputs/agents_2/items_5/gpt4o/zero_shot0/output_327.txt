Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  88   1  19  46
1  54  98  37   1   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 98 37  1  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
Agent 0: [98, 88, 1, 19, 46]
Agent 1: [54, 98, 37, 1, 8]
```

Let's allocate the items step by step, aiming to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 98.
   - Agent 1 values it at 54.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 88.
   - Agent 1 values it at 98.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 1.
   - Agent 1 values it at 37.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 19.
   - Agent 1 values it at 1.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 46.
   - Agent 1 values it at 8.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocation maximizes the total values for both agents given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
