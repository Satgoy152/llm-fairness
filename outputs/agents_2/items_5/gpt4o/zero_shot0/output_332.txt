Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  89  35  99  44  63
1  19  32  92  85  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, keeping in mind that each item must be allocated to one agent and each agent should receive an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the situation:

For Agent 0:
- Item 0: 89
- Item 1: 35
- Item 2: 99
- Item 3: 44
- Item 4: 63

Total value if Agent 0 gets all items: 330

For Agent 1:
- Item 0: 19
- Item 1: 32
- Item 2: 92
- Item 3: 85
- Item 4: 98

Total value if Agent 1 gets all items: 326

To find a balanced allocation, we try to distribute the items to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring fairness.

One way to achieve a fair allocation is to assign items where each agent places a comparatively higher value. Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0, 2 (Values: 89, 99)
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 3, 4 (Values: 32, 85, 98)

Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 188 and Agent 1 a total value of 215. While Agent 1 receives a slightly higher total value, this allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, aiming to balance the satisfaction for both agents.
