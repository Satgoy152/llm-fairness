Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  13  62  97  97  32
1  31  69  44   5  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use a method known as the "Kuhn-Munkres algorithm" or the "Hungarian method," which is often used for solving assignment problems. However, given the simplicity of this problem with only 2 agents and 5 items, we can use a basic greedy approach to ensure each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the table and the total value each agent places on the items:

- Agent 0 valuations: [13, 62, 97, 97, 32]
- Agent 1 valuations: [31, 69, 44, 5, 66]

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Total valuation for Agent 0: 13 + 62 + 97 + 97 + 32 = 301
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 31 + 69 + 44 + 5 + 66 = 215

To allocate the items, we want to ensure that each agent gets items in a way that their overall satisfaction is maximized, while ensuring both agents receive a fair number of items.

Let's proceed with a simple allocation by considering the highest value for each item:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 13
   - Agent 1 values it at 31
   - Allocate to Agent 1

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 62
   - Agent 1 values it at 69
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 97
   - Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 97
   - Agent 1 values it at 5
   - Allocate to Agent 0

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 32
   - Agent 1 values it at 66
   - Allocate to Agent 1

After these allocations, Agent 0 has items [2, 3], and Agent 1 has items [0, 1, 4].

Let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive a fair share of their total valuations.
