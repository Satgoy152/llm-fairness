Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  73  82  17  51  57
1  55  72  28  86  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple approach by examining each agent's valuations for the items. We'll try to allocate the items such that the total valuation for both agents is as balanced as possible. Let's evaluate and allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 73.
   - Agent 1 values it at 55.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 since they value it higher.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 82.
   - Agent 1 values it at 72.
   - Allocate to Agent 0 since they value it higher.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 17.
   - Agent 1 values it at 28.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 since they value it higher.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 51.
   - Agent 1 values it at 86.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 since they value it higher.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 57.
   - Agent 1 values it at 78.
   - Allocate to Agent 1 since they value it higher.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a way that respects their valuations, with Agent 0 getting items they value highly, and Agent 1 receiving the remaining items that they value more.
