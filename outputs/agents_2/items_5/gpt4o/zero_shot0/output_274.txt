Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  74  31  22  80  70
1  50  43  50  67  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will use a simple approach by ensuring that the total valuation each agent gets is as balanced as possible, while also making sure each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items:
   - Agent 0: 74 + 31 + 22 + 80 + 70 = 277
   - Agent 1: 50 + 43 + 50 + 67 + 52 = 262

2. Allocate items to balance the valuations:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (80).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (50).

3. One way to allocate could be:
   - Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 3.
   - Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.

4. Check total valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 74 (item 0) + 22 (item 2) + 80 (item 3) = 176
   - Agent 1: 43 (item 1) + 52 (item 4) = 95

Now letâ€™s present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 176 and Agent 1 a total valuation of 95, based on their respective valuations for the items. This approach tries to balance the total value each agent receives.
