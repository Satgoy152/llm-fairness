Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   3  23  38  13  26
1  43  67  65  76  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share. One common approach is to use an algorithm that seeks to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

- Agent 0's total value for all items: \(3 + 23 + 38 + 13 + 26 = 103\)
- Agent 1's total value for all items: \(43 + 67 + 65 + 76 + 66 = 317\)

Given the disparity in valuations, we should aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuation.

One approach is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation incrementally:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (as they value it highly: 67 vs. 23)
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (as they value it highly: 76 vs. 13)
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (as they value it highly: 65 vs. 38)
4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (as they value it highly: 66 vs. 26)

After these allocations, Agent 1 has received all items except item 0. Therefore, allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 already has a high total value.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 1, 2, 3, and 4.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```
