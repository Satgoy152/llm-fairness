Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1  2   3   4
0  86   7  3  57  24
1  72  13  8  61   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a simple method where we try to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the Items with Values for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 
     - Item 0: 86
     - Item 1: 7
     - Item 2: 3
     - Item 3: 57
     - Item 4: 24

   - Agent 1: 
     - Item 0: 72
     - Item 1: 13
     - Item 2: 8
     - Item 3: 61
     - Item 4: 5

2. **Prioritize the Items for Each Agent based on their Values:**

   - Agent 0's priority: [0, 3, 4, 1, 2]
   - Agent 1's priority: [3, 0, 1, 2, 4]

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Total Value:**

   We aim to allocate items such that each agent's total value is maximized while ensuring fairness in distribution:

   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 86) because it's their highest priority, and Agent 1 values it less (72).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (value 61) because it's their highest priority, and Agent 0 values it less (57).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0 (value 24) as it's their next highest available priority, and Agent 1 values it less (5).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (value 13) because it's their next highest available priority, and Agent 0 values it less (7).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 8) because it's the last available item and Agent 1 values it more (8 vs. 3 for Agent 0).

4. **Final Allocation:**

   - Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items [3, 1, 2]

5. **JSON Output:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share of items.
