Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  44  43  62  39  90
1  86  82  22   7   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible while making sure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [44, 43, 62, 39, 90]
Agent 1: [86, 82, 22, 7, 3]
```

We can calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 44 + 43 + 62 + 39 + 90 = 278
- Agent 1's total valuation: 86 + 82 + 22 + 7 + 3 = 200

We aim to allocate items such that the total value received by each agent is as close as possible. One way to do this is to allocate items based on the highest valuation difference between the agents. Hereâ€™s how we can do it step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 86, while Agent 0 values it at 44. The difference is 42, so allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 82, while Agent 0 values it at 43. The difference is 39, so allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 62, while Agent 1 values it at 22. The difference is 40, so allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 39, while Agent 1 values it at 7. The difference is 32, so allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 90, while Agent 1 values it at 3. The difference is 87, so allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's see the total values each agent receives under this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 3, 4] with values [62, 39, 90], totaling 191.
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1] with values [86, 82], totaling 168.

This allocation aims to be fair based on the given valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
