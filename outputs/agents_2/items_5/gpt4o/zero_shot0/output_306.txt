Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0   1  10  13  74  53
1  24  68  84  40  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's consider the valuations provided and aim for a fair distribution.

First, we list the total valuations for each item by both agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 1, and Agent 1 values it at 24.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 10, and Agent 1 values it at 68.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 13, and Agent 1 values it at 84.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 74, and Agent 1 values it at 40.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 53, and Agent 1 values it at 65.

To allocate these items fairly, we try to maximize each agent's total valuation by comparing the values for each item and assigning it to the agent who values it more, while keeping the distribution balanced.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 74, whereas Agent 1 values it at 40. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 53, whereas Agent 1 values it at 65. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 13, whereas Agent 1 values it at 84. Allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 10, whereas Agent 1 values it at 68. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 1, whereas Agent 1 values it at 24. Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, the allocations are as follows:

Agent 0:
- Item 3

Agent 1:
- Items 0, 1, 2, 4

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 4]
}
```
