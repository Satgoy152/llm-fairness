Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  82  53   0  59  53
1  44  11  40  55  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Let's analyze the valuations and determine a fair distribution of the items.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [82, 53, 0, 59, 53]
- Agent 1: [44, 11, 40, 55, 87]

To maximize fairness, let's allocate the items by looking at the highest valuations for each item:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 82.
   - Agent 1 values it at 44.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 53.
   - Agent 1 values it at 11.
   - Assign to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 0.
   - Agent 1 values it at 40.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 59.
   - Agent 1 values it at 55.
   - Assign to Agent 0 (slightly higher valuation).

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 53.
   - Agent 1 values it at 87.
   - Assign to Agent 1.

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution based on their valuations of the items.
