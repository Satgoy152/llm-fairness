Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  81  40   2  50   9
1   9  77  78  25  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.

Given the valuations:

| Item/Agent | 0  | 1  |
|------------|----|----|
| 0          | 81 | 9  |
| 1          | 40 | 77 |
| 2          | 2  | 78 |
| 3          | 50 | 25 |
| 4          | 9  | 45 |

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. Item 0 is highly valued by agent 0 (81) versus agent 1 (9).
2. Item 1 is highly valued by agent 1 (77) versus agent 0 (40).
3. Item 2 is highly valued by agent 1 (78) versus agent 0 (2).
4. Item 3 is more valued by agent 0 (50) versus agent 1 (25).
5. Item 4 is more valued by agent 1 (45) versus agent 0 (9).

Based on these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows to maximize the satisfaction of both agents:

- Agent 0 will get items 0 and 3, which are more valuable to them.
- Agent 1 will get items 1, 2, and 4, which are more valuable to them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
