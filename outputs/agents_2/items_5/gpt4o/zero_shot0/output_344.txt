Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  98  47  12  12  25
1  61  36  73  44  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to optimize the total value each agent receives.

Let's go through the process:

1. **List the valuations for each item by each agent:**

   Agent 0: [98, 47, 12, 12, 25]  
   Agent 1: [61, 36, 73, 44, 10]  

2. **Calculate the benefit of each item to each agent and attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes total value:**

   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 values it at 61
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 47, Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 values it at 73
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 values it at 44
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 25, Agent 1 values it at 10

3. **Allocate items based on highest valuation per item:**

   - Item 0: Allocated to Agent 0 (value 98 vs 61)
   - Item 1: Allocated to Agent 0 (value 47 vs 36)
   - Item 2: Allocated to Agent 1 (value 73 vs 12)
   - Item 3: Allocated to Agent 1 (value 44 vs 12)
   - Item 4: Allocated to Agent 0 (value 25 vs 10)

4. **Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:**

   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4]
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
