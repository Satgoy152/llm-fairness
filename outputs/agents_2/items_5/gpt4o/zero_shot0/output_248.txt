Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  12   5   2  56  88
1  28  39  58  79  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [28 39 58 79 51]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents based on their valuations, we can apply the method of maximizing total welfare. This means each item should be given to the agent who values it the most, ensuring maximum total value for the allocation.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 12, Agent 1 at 28.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 5, Agent 1 at 39.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 2, Agent 1 at 58.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 56, Agent 1 at 79.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 88, Agent 1 at 51.

Now, we'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Assigned to Agent 1 (28 > 12)
- Item 1: Assigned to Agent 1 (39 > 5)
- Item 2: Assigned to Agent 1 (58 > 2)
- Item 3: Assigned to Agent 1 (79 > 56)
- Item 4: Assigned to Agent 0 (88 > 51)

So, the fair allocation based on maximizing total welfare is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, maximizing the total value derived from the allocation.
