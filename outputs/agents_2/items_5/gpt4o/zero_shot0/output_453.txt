Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  93   0  86  17
1  23  48  14  34  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [23 48 14 34 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will use a method that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. Given the valuations from the table, we can try to allocate items in such a way that each agent is satisfied with their share.

Here is the table of valuations for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4
0  96  93   0  86  17
1  23  48  14  34  33
```

We'll proceed by analyzing the valuations and making allocations accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has moderate valuations for items 1, 3, and 4.

Considering the above, we can allocate items as follows:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation for it.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it values it higher than Agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it values it higher than Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, which is more valuable to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 0 has a valuation of 0 for it.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share of value according to their preferences.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2, 4]
}
```
