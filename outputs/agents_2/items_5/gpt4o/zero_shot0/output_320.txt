Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  49  75  80  79  68
1  51  85  14  77  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent, ensuring each gets an integer number of items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 80
  - Item 3: 79
  - Item 4: 68

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 14
  - Item 3: 77
  - Item 4: 24

To allocate items, we'll assign them based on the highest valuation difference between agents for each item, thereby maximizing each agent's satisfaction. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it slightly more (51 vs. 49), allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it significantly more (85 vs. 75), allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it significantly more (80 vs. 14), allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it more (79 vs. 77), allocate to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it significantly more (68 vs. 24), allocate to Agent 0.

Thus, each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 3, 4
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 1

Presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
