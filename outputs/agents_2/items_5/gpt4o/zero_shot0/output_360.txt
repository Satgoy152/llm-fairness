Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  58  63  23  17  98
1  92  73   6  98  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. This is often approached by maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 58
- Item 1: 63
- Item 2: 23
- Item 3: 17
- Item 4: 98

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 92
- Item 1: 73
- Item 2: 6
- Item 3: 98
- Item 4: 50

One common approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring that each item goes to the agent who values it the most. Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 92 and Agent 0 values it at 58. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 73 and Agent 0 values it at 63. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 23 and Agent 1 values it at 6. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 98 and Agent 0 values it at 17. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 98 and Agent 1 values it at 50. Allocate to Agent 0.

After this allocation, each agent receives a fair number of items based on their highest valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 3.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
