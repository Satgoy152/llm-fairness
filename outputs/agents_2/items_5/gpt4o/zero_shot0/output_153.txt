Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  46  50  58  63  15
1  47  36  69  28  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One possible approach is to use a method like the "Envy-Free" allocation or the "Max-Min" allocation, but for simplicity, we can use a straightforward approach by directly comparing valuations.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Compare the valuations of both agents for each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.

Evaluating the given table:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 47, Agent 0 values it at 46. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 50, Agent 1 values it at 36. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 69, Agent 0 values it at 58. Allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 63, Agent 1 values it at 28. Allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it at 85, Agent 0 values it at 15. Allocate to Agent 1.

Here is the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
