Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  70  84  13  37   3
1  93  12   2  21  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is a step-by-step approach to finding a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to each item:
   - Agent 0's values: [70, 84, 13, 37, 3]
   - Agent 1's values: [93, 12, 2, 21, 77]

2. Consider allocating items based on maximizing the sum of values for each agent while ensuring both agents get items.

3. Start by allocating items that one agent values significantly higher than the other:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (93 vs. 70).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (84 vs. 12).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (13 vs. 2).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (37 vs. 21).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it more (77 vs. 3).

4. Allocate:
   - Agent 0 gets items 1, 2, and 3.
   - Agent 1 gets items 0 and 4.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items and aims to respect the higher valuations each agent has for the items they receive.

Final allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```
