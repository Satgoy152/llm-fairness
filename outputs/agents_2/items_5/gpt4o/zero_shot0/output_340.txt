Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  14  26  52  38  42
1  96  59  84  44  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }
    Only give allocations for agents andi items in the table above.

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here, we will use a method that seeks to give each agent items that maximize their satisfaction, while trying to balance the overall allocation.

Let's evaluate the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [14, 26, 52, 38, 42]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [96, 59, 84, 44, 37]

Assign items based on the highest relative value each agent has for the items. We will iterate over each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 96, while Agent 0 values it at 14. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 59, while Agent 0 values it at 26. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 84, while Agent 0 values it at 52. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 38, while Agent 1 values it at 44. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 42, while Agent 1 values it at 37. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation might seem unbalanced, as Agent 1 receives more items. However, given the higher valuations Agent 1 has for most items, this distribution is aimed at maximizing total satisfaction.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the distribution attempts to maximize satisfaction based on the agents' valuations.
