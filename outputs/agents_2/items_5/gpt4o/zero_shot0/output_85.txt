Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 5 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4
0  87  67  99  36  49
1  98   7  78  39  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We can use a simple greedy approach by allocating the item with the highest value for each agent iteratively until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to allocate the items:

1. **Initialize the allocations:**
   - Start with an empty allocation for each agent.

2. **Sort items by value for each agent:**
   - For each agent, create a list of items sorted by their value in descending order.

3. **Allocate items:**
   - Iterate over the sorted lists and allocate the item with the highest value that hasn't yet been allocated, alternating between agents to ensure fairness.

Let's go through the process to allocate the items:

### Step 1: Initialize allocations

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": []
}
```

### Step 2: Ordered preferences

- **Agent 0's valuations (sorted):**
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 0: 87
  - Item 1: 67
  - Item 4: 49
  - Item 3: 36

- **Agent 1's valuations (sorted):**
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 4: 88
  - Item 2: 78
  - Item 3: 39
  - Item 1: 7

### Step 3: Allocate items

1. **Agent 0 gets Item 2** (highest value for Agent 0)
2. **Agent 1 gets Item 0** (highest value for Agent 1)
3. **Agent 0 gets Item 1** (next highest value for Agent 0)
4. **Agent 1 gets Item 4** (next highest value for Agent 1)
5. **Agent 0 gets Item 3** (remaining item)

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1, 3],
    "1": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
