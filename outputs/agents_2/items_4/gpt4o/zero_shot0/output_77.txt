Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0   3  58  25  89
1  35  44  85   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [35 44 85  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

First, let's break down the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 3
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 25
  - Item 3: 89

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 85
  - Item 3: 3

Now, we will try to allocate items to maximize total value for each agent while ensuring both agents get a fair share.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is Item 3 with a value of 89.
   - Next highest is Item 1 with a value of 58.
   - Allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is Item 2 with a value of 85.
   - Next highest is Item 0 with a value of 35.
   - Allocate these items to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 3]
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 2]

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items while attempting to maximize their satisfaction based on the given valuations.
