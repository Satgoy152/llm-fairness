Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  37  80  39
1  16  67  21  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16 67 21 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. This involves ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible by assigning items in a way that considers each agent's valuation of the items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [47, 37, 80, 39]
Agent 1: [16, 67, 21, 57]
```

Let's analyze the best allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (80), so we should allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (67), so we should allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. For the remaining items 0 and 3:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 47 and item 3 at 39.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 16 and item 3 at 57.

   Given these, let's allocate:
   - Item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it higher (47 vs. 16).
   - Item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it higher (57 vs. 39).

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
