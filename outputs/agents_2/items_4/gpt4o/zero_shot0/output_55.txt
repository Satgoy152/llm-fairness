Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  22  61  98  60
1   0  86  88  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 86 88 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will use a simple allocation approach to ensure fairness while respecting the integer requirement.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  22  61  98  60
1   0  86  88  20
```

We can proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is for item 2 (value of 98).
   - The second highest is item 1 (value of 61).
   - The third highest is item 3 (value of 60).
   
   Allocating items [2, 1, 3] to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is for item 2 (value of 88), but it is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - The next highest is item 1 (value of 86), but it is also allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next highest available is item 3 (value of 20).

   Allocating item [0] to Agent 1, as the remaining items have lower or zero value.

This allocation allows each agent to get an integer number of items while maximizing their respective valuations as much as possible given the constraints.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0]
}
```
