Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3
0  40  86  95  59
1  24  42  80  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction, represented by their valuations, while distributing all items.

Given the problem, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 95
  - Item 3: 59

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 80
  - Item 3: 72

A simple approach to ensure fairness is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item. Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 40.
   - Agent 1 values it at 24.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 86.
   - Agent 1 values it at 42.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 95.
   - Agent 1 values it at 80.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59.
   - Agent 1 values it at 72.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.
