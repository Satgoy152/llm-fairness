Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3
0  27  19  11  74
1  50  51  68   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for the items. We aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and ideally maximizes their total valuation from the allocated items.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [27, 19, 11, 74]
- Agent 1's valuations: [50, 51, 68, 9]

We'll use a simple allocation strategy that aims to maximize the total value for each agent by giving them the items they value the most. 

1. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (68), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (74), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** values item 1 the next most (51), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most from the remaining items (27), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3] with total valuation 27 + 74 = 101.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2] with total valuation 51 + 68 = 119.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, which provides a fair distribution based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
