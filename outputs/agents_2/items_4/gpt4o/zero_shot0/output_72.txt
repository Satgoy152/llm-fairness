Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3
0  65  98  87  27
1  31  37  61   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 37 61  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. In this scenario, we have two agents and four items.

Let's consider the total valuations of each agent for all items:

- Agent 0's valuations: 65 (Item 0), 98 (Item 1), 87 (Item 2), 27 (Item 3)
- Agent 1's valuations: 31 (Item 0), 37 (Item 1), 61 (Item 2), 6 (Item 3)

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets two items (since there are two agents and four items).

1. Start by assigning the items with the highest individual valuations to the agents:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest at 98. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest at 61. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

2. Next, assign the remaining items:
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 second highest at 65. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 second highest at 6. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, Agent 0 has Items [1, 0] and Agent 1 has Items [2, 3].

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receives a total value of 98 (Item 1) + 65 (Item 0) = 163
- Agent 1 receives a total value of 61 (Item 2) + 6 (Item 3) = 67

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
