Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  63  66  76
1   3  82  25  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are only two agents and four items, each agent should receive two items.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 63
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 76

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 3
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 25
  - Item 3: 98

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it more, then adjust to ensure each agent gets an equal number of items.

1. Compare valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values 47; Agent 1 values 3. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values 63; Agent 1 values 82. Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values 66; Agent 1 values 25. Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values 76; Agent 1 values 98. Assign to Agent 1.

2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items:
   - Agent 0 has items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 has items 1 and 3.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
