Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  84  93  26
1  21  48  83  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to find a way to distribute the items so that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Given the table, we have two agents and four items. The goal is to allocate these items in a way that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0: 18, Item 1: 84, Item 2: 93, Item 3: 26
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0: 21, Item 1: 48, Item 2: 83, Item 3: 74

A simple way to achieve fairness is to maximize the total satisfaction of both agents by assigning each item to the agent who values it more, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.
3. Ensure that each agent gets two items (since there are four items and two agents).

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (21 vs. 18), so assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (84 vs. 48), so assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (93 vs. 83), so assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (74 vs. 26), so assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

After this allocation, each agent has two items:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and tries to maximize the total satisfaction based on their valuations.
