Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0  54   1  76  31
1  59  68  66   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [59 68 66  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations. We should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: [54, 1, 76, 31]
- Agent 1: [59, 68, 66, 4]

Let's evaluate the best way to allocate items:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (76).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (68).
   - Both agents have high valuations for different items, so we can start by assigning them their top-valued items.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items remaining are 0 and 3.

4. **Evaluate Remaining Items:**
   - For item 0, Agent 0 has a valuation of 54, and Agent 1 has a valuation of 59. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 as 59 > 54.
   - For item 3, Agent 0 has a valuation of 31, and Agent 1 has a valuation of 4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 as 31 > 4.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

Based on this analysis, the allocation of items to agents in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
