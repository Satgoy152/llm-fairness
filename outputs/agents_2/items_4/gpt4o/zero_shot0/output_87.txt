Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  20  51  14  95
1  67  96  59  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1) while considering their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This is a simple instance of the "fair division" problem, specifically an allocation problem where the goal is to distribute items such that each agent gets an equitable share, considering each agent's valuation of the items.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 20     | 51     | 14     | 95     |
| 1     | 67     | 96     | 59     | 18     |

We can proceed by examining the highest valued items for each agent and allocating them in a way that balances the total value each agent receives. A simple approach is to allocate items based on a "max-min fairness" principle, where we iteratively assign items to the agent who values them most until all items are allocated. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (95), so assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (96), so assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 1 values item 2 the next highest (59) after item 1, so assign item 2 to agent 1.
4. Agent 0 values item 0 the next highest (20) after item 3, so assign item 0 to agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
