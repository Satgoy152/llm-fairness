Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  45  91  80
1  95  41  84   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 41 84  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [60, 45, 91, 80]
Agent 1: [95, 41, 84, 7]
```

We need to allocate the items so that the distribution is fair in terms of the total value each agent receives.

Let's try to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 60, Agent 1 values it at 95. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 41. Allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 91, Agent 1 values it at 84. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 values it at 7. Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 gets items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.

Let's double-check the total values:
- Total value for Agent 0: 45 + 91 + 80 = 216
- Total value for Agent 1: 95

This allocation is fair in terms of maximizing each agent's value based on their preferences.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0]
}
```
