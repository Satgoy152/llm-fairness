Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3
0  72  90  25  34
1  81  22  77  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their individual valuations of each item. The goal is to ensure that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 72
  - Item 1 at 90
  - Item 2 at 25
  - Item 3 at 34

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 81
  - Item 1 at 22
  - Item 2 at 77
  - Item 3 at 75

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. One way to ensure fairness in allocation is to look for a pattern that allows each agent to maximize their perceived value of the items they receive.

Here's a potential allocation based on maximizing each agent's total perceived value:

1. Calculate the total value each agent would get if they received each item:

   - For item 0: Agent 0 values it at 72, and Agent 1 values it at 81.
   - For item 1: Agent 0 values it at 90, and Agent 1 values it at 22.
   - For item 2: Agent 0 values it at 25, and Agent 1 values it at 77.
   - For item 3: Agent 0 values it at 34, and Agent 1 values it at 75.

2. Assign items to the agent who values them more:

   - Item 0: Assign to Agent 1 (81 > 72)
   - Item 1: Assign to Agent 0 (90 > 22)
   - Item 2: Assign to Agent 1 (77 > 25)
   - Item 3: Assign to Agent 1 (75 > 34)

3. Check the fairness of the allocation:

   - Agent 0 receives item 1, with a total value of 90.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, and 3, with a total value of 81 + 77 + 75 = 233.

This allocation maximizes the total value each agent perceives, thus achieving a fair distribution based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution is based on maximizing their individual valuations.
