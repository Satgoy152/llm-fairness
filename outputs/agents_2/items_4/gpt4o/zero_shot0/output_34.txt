Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  20  33  38
1  90  69  66  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value received by each agent. Given the valuations by the agents, we will aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the given table:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  58  20  33  38
1  90  69  66  36
```

We have two agents (0 and 1) and four items (0, 1, 2, 3).

1. **Agent 0** valuations: [58, 20, 33, 38]
2. **Agent 1** valuations: [90, 69, 66, 36]

For a fair allocation, we'll try to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Item 0**: Valuation for Agent 0 is 58, and for Agent 1 is 90. Assign to Agent 1 (higher valuation).
- **Item 1**: Valuation for Agent 0 is 20, and for Agent 1 is 69. Assign to Agent 1 (higher valuation).
- **Item 2**: Valuation for Agent 0 is 33, and for Agent 1 is 66. Assign to Agent 1 (higher valuation).
- **Item 3**: Valuation for Agent 0 is 38, and for Agent 1 is 36. Assign to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

### Allocation Result:

- **Agent 0** receives items: [3]
- **Agent 1** receives items: [0, 1, 2]

Finally, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and aims to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences.
