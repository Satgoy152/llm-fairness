Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  71  10  26  52
1  66  57  35  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to consider their valuations of the items and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Given there are 4 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:**
   - Item 0: 71
   - Item 1: 10
   - Item 2: 26
   - Item 3: 52

2. **Agent 1's valuations:**
   - Item 0: 66
   - Item 1: 57
   - Item 2: 35
   - Item 3: 18

We will allocate by considering which items give the highest combined satisfaction to the agents, while ensuring each gets two items:

- **Agent 0** values item 0 the most, so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the most, so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** next values item 3 the most, so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** next values item 2 the most, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives each agent two items, trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
