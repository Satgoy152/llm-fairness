Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  40  28  50
1  21  31  32  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [44, 40, 28, 50]
Agent 1: [21, 31, 32, 31]
```

We need to allocate the items in a way that reflects these preferences as much as possible while ensuring fairness. One way to do this is by using a greedy algorithm to allocate items to the agent who values them most, ensuring each agent receives exactly two items since there are two agents and four items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 44.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 21.
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 40.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 31.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 28.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 at 32.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 50.
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 at 31.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

Now, let's ensure fairness by re-evaluating the allocations since Agent 0 has received three items. We can swap one of the items with Agent 1 to balance the allocation.

**Swap Item 1 with Item 3:**

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

This results in:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2]

This allocation is balanced with each agent receiving two items, and it maximizes the overall valuation for each agent given the constraints.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
