Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  38  39  90  15
1  48  99  94  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Let's evaluate the best allocation:

### Valuations Table

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|
| **0**      | 38 | 39 | 90 | 15 |
| **1**      | 48 | 99 | 94 | 83 |

### Steps to Fair Allocation

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: 38 (Agent 0) + 48 (Agent 1) = 86
   - Item 1: 39 (Agent 0) + 99 (Agent 1) = 138
   - Item 2: 90 (Agent 0) + 94 (Agent 1) = 184
   - Item 3: 15 (Agent 0) + 83 (Agent 1) = 98

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Each Agent's Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most at 90.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the most at 99.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 since it has higher value for Agent 1 (48 vs. 38).
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 since it has higher value for Agent 1 (83 vs. 15).

### Final Allocation

- **Agent 0:** Item 2
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 1, 3

### JSON Representation of the Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items and maximizes their individual valuations based on the given table.
