Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3
0  84  63   4  66
1  15  84  32  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items. 

Here are the steps to achieve an allocation:

1. **Analyze Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values the items as follows: [84, 63, 4, 66].
   - Agent 1 values the items as follows: [15, 84, 32, 23].

2. **Prioritize High Valuation Items:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1.

3. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 0 and 3 to agent 0 because they have the highest valuation for these items.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 1 because they have the highest valuation for this item.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - The remaining item is 2.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 more than agent 0 (32 vs 4).
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
