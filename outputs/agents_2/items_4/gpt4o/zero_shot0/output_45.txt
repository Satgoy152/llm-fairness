Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3
0  94   4  13  80
1  31  83   4   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, given their valuations for each item. Here, we have two agents (0 and 1) and four items (0, 1, 2, and 3). Let's analyze the values each agent assigns to each item:

```
Agent 0: [94, 4, 13, 80]
Agent 1: [31, 83, 4, 3]
```

In order to allocate items fairly, we need to ensure that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible. We can use a greedy approach to maximize each agent's value:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 94 while Agent 1 values it at 31. Allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 4 while Agent 1 values it at 83. Allocate to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 13 while Agent 1 values it at 4. Allocate to Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 80 while Agent 1 values it at 3. Allocate to Agent 0.

After these allocations, the distribution is:

- Agent 0 receives items: [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1 receives items: [1]

Here's the JSON representation of the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1]
}
```
