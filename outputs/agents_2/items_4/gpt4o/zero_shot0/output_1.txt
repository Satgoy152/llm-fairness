Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3
0  70  80  54  58
1  16  59  29  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent given the constraints. A common approach is to use the "Maximum Weight Matching" in bipartite graphs or similar optimization methods to achieve this.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. **Set up a matrix of valuations:**
   - Agent 0: [70, 80, 54, 58]
   - Agent 1: [16, 59, 29, 32]

2. **Consider the total value each agent gets from the items:**
   - Agent 0's total value if they get all items: 70 + 80 + 54 + 58 = 262
   - Agent 1's total value if they get all items: 16 + 59 + 29 + 32 = 136

3. **Allocate the items to maximize each agent's total value:**
   - We aim to allocate the items so that the total value for each agent is balanced or fair.

4. **Allocation strategy:**
   - Since agent 0 values item 0 highly (70), it makes sense to assign item 0 to agent 0.
   - Agent 0 also values item 1 highly (80), so it should also go to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 more than agent 0 (32 vs. 58), so item 3 should go to agent 1.
   - Item 2 is valued more by agent 1 than by agent 0 (29 vs. 54), so item 2 should go to agent 1.

Based on these considerations, the allocation of items is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
