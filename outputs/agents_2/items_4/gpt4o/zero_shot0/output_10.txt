Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3
0   9  72  81  15
1  39  80  41   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 9      | 72     | 81     | 15     |
| 1     | 39     | 80     | 41     | 0      |

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0:** Has high valuations for item 1 and item 2.
2. **Agent 1:** Has high valuations for item 1 and item 0.

A balanced allocation could be:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 because they value it highly (81 vs. 41).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it highly (80 vs. 72).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 because they value it more (39 vs. 9).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 by default because it's the only remaining item.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
