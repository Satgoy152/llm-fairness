Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  82  12  87  50
1  92  69  74  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. In this case, since there are only two agents and four items, each agent will get two items. We will use a method similar to the Hungarian algorithm to optimize the allocation based on the given valuations.

First, let's consider the valuations:
```
Agent 0: [82, 12, 87, 50]
Agent 1: [92, 69, 74, 65]
```

To maximize the total valuation, we will assign the items as follows:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (second-highest available for Agent 1).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (remaining item for Agent 0).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items and maximizes the total valuation given the constraints.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
