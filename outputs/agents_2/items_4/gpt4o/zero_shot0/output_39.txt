Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  69  21  80
1  11  79  69  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them most. Here's how we can proceed step-by-step:

1. List all items with their respective agents' valuations.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's apply this to our specific case:

### Agents' Valuations for Items

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 44, Agent 1 values it at 11.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 values it at 79.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 21, Agent 1 values it at 69.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 values it at 10.

### Allocation

1. **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 0 (44 vs 11).
2. **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 1 (69 vs 79).
3. **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 1 (21 vs 69).
4. **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 0 (80 vs 10).

### Allocated Items

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 3].
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 2].

Now, let's format the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the items are fairly distributed based on the highest valuation.
