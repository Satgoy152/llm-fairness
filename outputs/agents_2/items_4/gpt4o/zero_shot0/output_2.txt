Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0   7  75  97  42
1  73   5  88   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We have two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) and four items (Item 0, 1, 2, and 3). Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 7
- Item 1: 75
- Item 2: 97
- Item 3: 42

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 73
- Item 1: 5
- Item 2: 88
- Item 3: 0

To achieve a fair allocation, we could try to maximize the total value each agent gets:

1. **Agent 0** highly values Items 1 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 0 and Item 2.

Let's propose an allocation:

- Assign **Item 2** to **Agent 0** as it is highly valued by both agents, but Agent 0 values it slightly more.
- Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 1** since it is highly valued by Agent 1.
- Assign **Item 1** to **Agent 0** since the value (75) is significant for Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.
- Assign **Item 3** to **Agent 1** since it holds no value for Agent 1, but Agent 0 has a lesser valuation for it.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3]

The total value for each agent is:
- Agent 0: 75 (Item 1) + 97 (Item 2) = 172
- Agent 1: 73 (Item 0) + 0 (Item 3) = 73

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
