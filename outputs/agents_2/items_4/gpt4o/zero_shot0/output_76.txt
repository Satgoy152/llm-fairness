Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0   2  54  28  24
1  18  41  94   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations that each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's assign the items to the agents based on the given valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 2
- Item 1: 54
- Item 2: 28
- Item 3: 24

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 18
- Item 1: 41
- Item 2: 94
- Item 3: 6

First, let's start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0 is valued more by Agent 1 (18 vs 2)
- Item 1 is valued more by Agent 0 (54 vs 41)
- Item 2 is valued more by Agent 1 (94 vs 28)
- Item 3 is valued more by Agent 0 (24 vs 6)

Allocating based on the above, we have:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 3
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 2

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most, resulting in a fair distribution based on their preferences.
