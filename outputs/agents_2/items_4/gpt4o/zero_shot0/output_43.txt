Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  16  89  55  78
1  37  31  89   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. This problem can be approached as a classic "assignment problem" or "fair division problem." Here, we aim to allocate the items such that the sum of valuations is as equitable as possible between the agents.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: `[16, 89, 55, 78]` with a total valuation of 238.
   - Agent 1: `[37, 31, 89, 8]` with a total valuation of 165.

2. **Fair Allocation Strategy:**
   - The goal is to distribute the items such that both agents have a near-equal share of their total valuations. 

3. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - For each item, allocate it to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

4. **Allocation Process:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 37, which is higher than Agent 0's 16.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 89, which is higher than Agent 1's 31.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 89, which is higher than Agent 0's 55.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 78, which is higher than Agent 1's 8.

5. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items `[1, 3]`.
   - Agent 1 receives items `[0, 2]`.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent maximizes their total valuation from the items they receive, maintaining balance in their respective total valuations.
