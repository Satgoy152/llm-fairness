Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  36   8  15  16
1  36  95   5  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here, we have two agents and four items, and we need to distribute these items such that each agent gets items that maximize their total valuation.

Let's evaluate the total valuation based on the available data:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 0: 36
   - Item 1: 8
   - Item 2: 15
   - Item 3: 16

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0: 36
   - Item 1: 95
   - Item 2: 5
   - Item 3: 48

A possible approach is to allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent. Here's one way to do the allocation:

1. **Agent 1 has a very high valuation for item 1 (95), so it is sensible to allocate item 1 to Agent 1.**

2. **Agent 0:**
   - The remaining items are 0, 2, and 3.
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0 (36), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 1:**
   - The remaining items are 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 (48) more than item 2 (5), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

4. **Agent 0:**
   - The only remaining item is item 2, which goes to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents get an integer number of items and attempts to maximize the value based on each agent's preferences.
