Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  48  54  48
1  54  27  85  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while also considering their valuations. One common approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0:
Item 0: 8
Item 1: 48
Item 2: 54
Item 3: 48

Agent 1:
Item 0: 54
Item 1: 27
Item 2: 85
Item 3: 63
```

To allocate the items fairly while maximizing total valuations, we can use a greedy approach. We will assign items based on the highest value for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets two items since there are 4 items and 2 agents.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Agent 1:**  
   - Item 2 has the highest value (85).
   - Item 3 is the second highest (63).

2. **Agent 0:**  
   - Item 1 has the highest value (48) among the remaining items.
   - Item 0 is the second highest (8) among the remaining items.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
