Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  72  58  90  66
1  54   2  91  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. List the valuations for each item by each agent:
   - Agent 0: [72, 58, 90, 66]
   - Agent 1: [54, 2, 91, 31]

2. Calculate the total value each agent would receive for all possible allocations. Since we have only 2 agents and 4 items, we can consider all possible ways to split the items between the two agents.

3. One possible strategy is to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them. This would mean allocating:
   - Item 0 to Agent 0 (since 72 > 54)
   - Item 1 to Agent 0 (since 58 > 2)
   - Item 2 to Agent 1 (since 91 > 90)
   - Item 3 to Agent 0 (since 66 > 31)

4. Verify that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here, Agent 0 receives 3 items, and Agent 1 receives 1 item, which satisfies the integer condition.

5. Present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences and ensures that all items are allocated.
