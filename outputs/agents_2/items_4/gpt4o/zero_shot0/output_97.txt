Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3
0   9   7  32  50
1  15  42   4  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [15 42  4 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on these valuations.

The valuations given are:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 32
  - Item 3: 50

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 15
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 77

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 9 + 7 + 32 + 50 = 98
- Agent 1 total valuation: 15 + 42 + 4 + 77 = 138

To allocate fairly, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation:

- Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 0:
  - Agent 0 receives: Item 0 (9) + Item 2 (32) = 41
- Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 1:
  - Agent 1 receives: Item 1 (42) + Item 3 (77) = 119

This allocation respects each agent's valuation preference and divides the items fairly considering their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items (2 items each) and takes into account their valuations, providing a fair split based on the given data.
