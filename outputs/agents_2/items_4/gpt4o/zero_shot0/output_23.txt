Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3
0  80  71  82  46
1  69  31  44  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their valuations of the items. This is typically a problem of maximizing utility, often solved using algorithms such as the Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment. 

Given the provided valuations:

```
Agent 0: [80, 71, 82, 46]
Agent 1: [69, 31, 44, 30]
```

We start by considering the highest value items for each agent and ensuring each agent receives an approximately equal share of total value. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 2** is most valued by Agent 0 at 82. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0** is next most valued by Agent 0 at 80. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 1** is next most valued by Agent 0 at 71. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 1 at 30. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

Each agent ends up with an integer number of items (Agent 0 with 3 items, and Agent 1 with 1 item), and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3]
}
```
