Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  77  97   2
1  56  64  87  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Here, we have 2 agents and 4 items. We will use a simple allocation strategy to try and achieve a fair distribution based on the given valuations.

First, let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 97
  - Item 3: 2

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 64
  - Item 2: 87
  - Item 3: 11

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. Item 2 has high value for both agents, but agent 0 values it more than agent 1 (97 vs 87). Assign Item 2 to agent 0.
2. Item 1 also has high value for both agents, but agent 0 values it more than agent 1 (77 vs 64). Assign Item 1 to agent 0.
3. Item 0 has higher value for agent 1 than agent 0 (56 vs 32). Assign Item 0 to agent 1.
4. Item 3 has a very low value for both agents, but slightly higher for agent 1 (11 vs 2). Assign Item 3 to agent 1.

Now we have the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 3

Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
