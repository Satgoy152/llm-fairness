Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2  3
0  15  48  69  6
1  63  25  87  3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here, we have two agents (0 and 1) and four items (0, 1, 2, and 3). 

Let's evaluate the allocations based on the agents' valuations:

Agent 0 valuations: [15, 48, 69, 6]
Agent 1 valuations: [63, 25, 87, 3]

A potential fair allocation strategy is to allocate items that maximize the total value for each agent. We can apply the following approach:

1. Assign the highest value items to each agent, considering the overall distribution of values.

Let's try to allocate the items:

- Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 1 (87), so allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Item 1 has the next highest value for Agent 0 (48), so allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Item 0 has a higher value for Agent 1 (63) than for Agent 0 (15), so allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Item 3 has the remaining value for Agent 0 (6), so allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

The allocation based on the above strategy is:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
