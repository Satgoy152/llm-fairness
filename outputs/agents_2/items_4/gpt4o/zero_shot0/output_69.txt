Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0  30  90  63  80
1  13  96  99   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 96 99  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. In this case, since there are two agents and four items, each agent should ideally receive two items. Let's calculate potential allocations by considering the total value each agent would receive for different combinations:

### Valuations Table
```
Agent 0: [30, 90, 63, 80]
Agent 1: [13, 96, 99, 9]
```

### Possible Allocations
1. **Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1, Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3:**
   - Agent 0 total value: 30 + 90 = 120
   - Agent 1 total value: 99 + 9 = 108

2. **Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2, Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3:**
   - Agent 0 total value: 30 + 63 = 93
   - Agent 1 total value: 96 + 9 = 105

3. **Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3, Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2:**
   - Agent 0 total value: 30 + 80 = 110
   - Agent 1 total value: 96 + 99 = 195

4. **Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2, Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3:**
   - Agent 0 total value: 90 + 63 = 153
   - Agent 1 total value: 13 + 9 = 22

5. **Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3, Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2:**
   - Agent 0 total value: 90 + 80 = 170
   - Agent 1 total value: 13 + 99 = 112

6. **Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3, Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1:**
   - Agent 0 total value: 63 + 80 = 143
   - Agent 1 total value: 13 + 96 = 109

### Fair Allocation
To balance the values between the agents and ensure fairness, let's choose an allocation where both agents' total values are as balanced as possible while maximizing total value:

- **Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3, Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.**

This allocation provides a reasonable balance between the total values received by each agent.

### JSON Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
