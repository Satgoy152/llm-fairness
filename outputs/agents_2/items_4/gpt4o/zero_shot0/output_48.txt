Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3
0   7  39  76  14
1  46  21  16  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations for each item. Here's how we can approach the problem:

1. **List Item Values for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: [7, 39, 76, 14]
   - Agent 1: [46, 21, 16, 69]

2. **Pair Items with Values**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 -> 7, Agent 1 -> 46
   - Item 1: Agent 0 -> 39, Agent 1 -> 21
   - Item 2: Agent 0 -> 76, Agent 1 -> 16
   - Item 3: Agent 0 -> 14, Agent 1 -> 69

3. **Decide Item Allocation Based on Higher Valuation**:
   - Compare the values for each item and assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation.

4. **Allocate Items**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (46 > 7)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (39 > 21)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (76 > 16)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (69 > 14)

5. **Resulting Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2
   - Agent 1 receives items: 0, 3

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives according to their valuation of the items.
