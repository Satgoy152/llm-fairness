Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

   0   1   2   3
0  6  53  55  77
1  0  80  67  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the perceived value for each agent. Given that we have two agents and four items, each agent should ideally receive two items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **List the items with their valuations for each agent:**

   Agent 0:
   - Item 0: Value 6
   - Item 1: Value 53
   - Item 2: Value 55
   - Item 3: Value 77

   Agent 1:
   - Item 0: Value 0
   - Item 1: Value 80
   - Item 2: Value 67
   - Item 3: Value 48

2. **Determine the optimal allocation:**

   - Start by assigning the items with the highest valuation to each agent.
   - For Agent 0, the highest valued item is Item 3 (value 77).
   - For Agent 1, the highest valued item is Item 1 (value 80).

3. **Allocate the remaining items:**

   - Agent 0 has already received Item 3. The next highest value items are Item 2 (value 55) and Item 1 (value 53). Since Item 1 is already taken by Agent 1, Agent 0 should receive Item 2.
   - Agent 1 has already received Item 1. The next highest value items are Item 2 (value 67) and Item 3 (value 48). Item 3 is already taken by Agent 0, so Agent 1 should receive Item 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 2 and Item 3.
   - Agent 1 gets Item 0 and Item 1.

5. **Present the allocations in the required JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the items are allocated to maximize their valuations based on their preferences.
