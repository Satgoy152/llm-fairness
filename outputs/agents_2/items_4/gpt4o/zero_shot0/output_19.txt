Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  46  64   7
1  83  58   3  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 21
- Item 1: 46
- Item 2: 64
- Item 3: 7

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 83
- Item 1: 58
- Item 2: 3
- Item 3: 10

Given that there are two agents and four items, each agent should ideally get two items.

To maximize the total valuation for each agent, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the difference in valuation for each item between the two agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.
3. Balance the allocations so that each agent gets two items.

Let's calculate the differences:

- For Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (83 vs 21).
- For Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (58 vs 46).
- For Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (64 vs 3).
- For Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (7 vs 10).

However, we should balance the allocation:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

Now, each agent has two items, and the allocation looks fair based on their valuations.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
