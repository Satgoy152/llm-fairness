Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  51  93  11
1  89  18  57  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List Valuations**: We have the following valuations table:

   ```
   Agent 0: [18, 51, 93, 11]
   Agent 1: [89, 18, 57, 96]
   ```

2. **Determine Optimal Allocation**:
   - We'll allocate items in a way that maximizes the valuation for each agent while ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Compare valuations for each item and assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item.

   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 89, while Agent 0 values it at 18. Allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 51, while Agent 1 values it at 18. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 93, while Agent 1 values it at 57. Allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 96, while Agent 0 values it at 11. Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.

5. **JSON Representation**:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and prioritizes assigning items based on higher valuation for each agent.
