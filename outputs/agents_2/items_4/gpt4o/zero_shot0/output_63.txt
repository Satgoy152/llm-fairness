Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3
0  55   6  53  77
1  11  72  83  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55  6 53 77]
 [11 72 83 27]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. For this case, we can use a simple approach such as calculating the total value each agent places on each item, and then assigning items to agents based on who values them more.

Given the valuation table:
```
      0   1   2   3
0  55   6  53  77
1  11  72  83  27
```

Let's evaluate each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 values it at 11. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 values it at 72. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 53, Agent 1 values it at 83. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 27. Assign to Agent 0.

Based on these valuations, the allocation will be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.

So, the allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
