Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3
0  74  94  33  30
1  80  10  14  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [80 10 14 71]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [74, 94, 33, 30]
Agent 1: [80, 10, 14, 71]
```

Let's analyze the values:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - Item 0: 74
   - Item 1: 94
   - Item 2: 33
   - Item 3: 30

2. **Agent 1** values:
   - Item 0: 80
   - Item 1: 10
   - Item 2: 14
   - Item 3: 71

To allocate fairly, we aim to balance the total value each agent gets, if possible. Here is one way to allocate the items to achieve a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items with the highest valuations that are unique to Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.
  - Item 1 (value 94 for Agent 0, value 10 for Agent 1)
  - Item 2 (value 33 for Agent 0, value 14 for Agent 1)

- **Agent 1**: Allocate the remaining items prioritizing higher valued items for Agent 1.
  - Item 0 (value 80 for Agent 1, value 74 for Agent 0)
  - Item 3 (value 71 for Agent 1, value 30 for Agent 0)

Thus, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide a fair share based on the valuations provided by each agent.
