Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  71  38  27
1  29  70  20  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 71 38 27]
 [29 70 20 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [52, 71, 38, 27]
Agent 1: [29, 70, 20, 65]
```

Let's calculate a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: 
   - For item 0: Agent 0 values it at 52, and Agent 1 values it at 29. (Winner: Agent 0)
   - For item 1: Agent 0 values it at 71, and Agent 1 values it at 70. (Winner: Agent 0)
   - For item 2: Agent 0 values it at 38, and Agent 1 values it at 20. (Winner: Agent 0)
   - For item 3: Agent 0 values it at 27, and Agent 1 values it at 65. (Winner: Agent 1)

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations**:
   - Agent 0 gets items 0, 1, and 2.
   - Agent 1 gets item 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation.

**Final Allocations in JSON format:**
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3]
}
```
