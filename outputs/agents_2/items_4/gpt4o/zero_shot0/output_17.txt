Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3
0  80  84  15  78
1  77  42  32  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that the distribution is as equitable as possible based on their valuations. One common approach to achieve this is to use the "maximum envy-free" allocation strategy, where each agent gets items such that their perceived value is maximized and the envy (the difference in value between what an agent receives and what they perceive another agent has) is minimized.

Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 80 (Item 0) + 84 (Item 1) + 15 (Item 2) + 78 (Item 3) = 257
   - Agent 1: 77 (Item 0) + 42 (Item 1) + 32 (Item 2) + 89 (Item 3) = 240

2. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items: 1 (84) and 0 (80) the most.
   - Agent 1 values items: 3 (89) and 0 (77) the most.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring the total value difference is minimized.

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (high value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (high value for Agent 1).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (remaining item with relatively higher value for Agent 1).

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives. With this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, with a total value of 164.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3, with a total value of 121.

While not perfect, this allocation provides a balanced approach given the constraints.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their respective valuations as equitably as possible.
