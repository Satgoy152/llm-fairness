Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3
0  55  76   5   8
1   3  59  30  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by the agents. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of both agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the allocations:

Given valuations:
- Agent 0 values: [55, 76, 5, 8]
- Agent 1 values: [3, 59, 30, 32]

To maximize fairness, one approach is to allocate items based on their highest valuation:

1. Item 0: Valued higher by Agent 0 (55 vs. 3), allocate to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Valued higher by Agent 0 (76 vs. 59), allocate to Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Valued higher by Agent 1 (30 vs. 5), allocate to Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Valued higher by Agent 1 (32 vs. 8), allocate to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocations are:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
