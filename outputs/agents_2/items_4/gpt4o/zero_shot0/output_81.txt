Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  13  55   1  55
1  36  45  47  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives, aiming for a solution where both agents feel they have received a fair share. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this:

1. **List the items with their valuations for both agents:**

   - Agent 0: [13, 55, 1, 55]
   - Agent 1: [36, 45, 47, 86]

2. **Allocate based on maximizing value for each agent:**

   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 3 (both are 55).
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 (86) and 2 (47).

3. **Find a fair allocation:**

   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 because it is most valuable for them.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 because it is most valuable for them after item 3.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because it is more valuable for them than for Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because it is more valuable for them than for Agent 1.

Here is the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 1]
- Agent 1 gets items [2, 3]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
