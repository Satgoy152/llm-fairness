Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3
0  99  18  41  52
1  39  29  33  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we can use a method that takes into account the preferences of each agent for the items. One simple method is to use a greedy approach where each agent is allocated the item for which they have the highest valuation, and this process is repeated until all items are allocated. Let's do that for the given data:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 99
- Item 1: 18
- Item 2: 41
- Item 3: 52

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 39
- Item 1: 29
- Item 2: 33
- Item 3: 87

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 99
   - Agent 1 values it at 39
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (higher valuation)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 18
   - Agent 1 values it at 29
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (higher valuation)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 41
   - Agent 1 values it at 33
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (higher valuation)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 52
   - Agent 1 values it at 87
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (higher valuation)

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
