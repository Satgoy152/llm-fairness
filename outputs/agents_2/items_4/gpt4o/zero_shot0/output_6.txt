Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0  66  47  43  83
1  85  36  72  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given valuations:

For Agent 0:
- Item 0: 66
- Item 1: 47
- Item 2: 43
- Item 3: 83

For Agent 1:
- Item 0: 85
- Item 1: 36
- Item 2: 72
- Item 3: 74

We can employ a simple strategy to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it more.
2. Re-evaluate if the allocation results in an unfair distribution.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (85 vs. 66).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (47 vs. 36).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (72 vs. 43).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it more (83 vs. 74).

Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3 (Value: 47 + 83 = 130)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2 (Value: 85 + 72 = 157)

To balance the allocation, we can aim for equal or closer total values:

Revised Allocation:
- Swap Item 2 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 and Item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 to balance the values:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2 (Value: 47 + 43 = 90)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3 (Value: 85 + 74 = 159)

After revision, the allocation seems more balanced:

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 3 (Value: 43 + 83 = 126)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1 (Value: 85 + 36 = 121)

Now, let me present the final allocations in the required json format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
