Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  86  75  40  23
1  17  14  50  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and ideally, the allocation should maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [86, 75, 40, 23]
- Agent 1's valuations: [17, 14, 50, 93]

We'll use a simple approach to maximize each agent's total valuation by allocating items they value the most.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 86
   - Agent 1 values it at 17
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

2. **Allocate Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 75
   - Agent 1 values it at 14
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

3. **Allocate Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 40
   - Agent 1 values it at 50
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

4. **Allocate Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 23
   - Agent 1 values it at 93
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1]
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 3]

The allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences.

{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
