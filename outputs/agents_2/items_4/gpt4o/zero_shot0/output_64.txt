Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  25  22  73  13
1  13  62  89  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for the items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, there are 4 items and 2 agents, so each agent will receive 2 items. 

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [25, 22, 73, 13]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [13, 62, 89, 94]

A straightforward approach to achieve a fair allocation is to assign the items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the remaining items. We will do this step by step:

1. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 94, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 1's next highest valuation is for item 2 at 89, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Now, Agent 0 will receive the remaining items, which are item 0 and item 1.

The allocation based on this process is:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
