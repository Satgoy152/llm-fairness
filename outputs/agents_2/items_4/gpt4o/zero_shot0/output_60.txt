Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  83  81  51  30
1  59  97  34  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. Our goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives, possibly using concepts like the "maximum matching" approach in bipartite graphs, where agents are on one side and items are on the other.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's overall value:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 83
   - Item 1: 81
   - Item 2: 51
   - Item 3: 30

2. **Agent 1 Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 59
   - Item 1: 97
   - Item 2: 34
   - Item 3: 88

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- Start by looking for the highest value for each agent and allocate that item if it's not already taken. If an item is equally valued by both agents, preference can be given based on the next highest value.

- **Item 0:**
  - Agent 0 values this at 83.
  - Agent 1 values this at 59.
  - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (higher value).

- **Item 1:**
  - Agent 0 values this at 81.
  - Agent 1 values this at 97.
  - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (higher value).

- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 0 values this at 51.
  - Agent 1 values this at 34.
  - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (higher value).

- **Item 3:**
  - Agent 0 values this at 30.
  - Agent 1 values this at 88.
  - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (higher value).

**Final Allocations:**

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
