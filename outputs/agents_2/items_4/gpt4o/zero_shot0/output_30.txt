Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  33   2  51
1  57   4  48  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57  4 48 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. The goal is to make the allocation as fair as possible, possibly using a method like maximizing the minimum value each agent receives.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0:
- Item 0: 96
- Item 1: 33
- Item 2: 2
- Item 3: 51

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 57
- Item 1: 4
- Item 2: 48
- Item 3: 85
```

Letâ€™s allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values this item significantly more than Agent 1 (96 vs. 57). We allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values this item more than Agent 1 (33 vs. 4). We allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 1 values this item significantly more than Agent 0 (48 vs. 2). We allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 1 values this item more than Agent 0 (85 vs. 51). We allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. 

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
