Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3
0  21   4  30  67
1  33  39   2  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we'll use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. Since we have two agents and four items, each agent should receive two items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [21, 4, 30, 67]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [33, 39, 2, 70]

To achieve a fair allocation, we could use a method like the "Maximum Weighted Matching" in bipartite graphs, where we maximize the sum of the valuations of the items allocated to each agent.

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it the highest (70), and removing it prevents Agent 0 from getting their highest valued item (67).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it the second highest (30), and Agent 1 values it the lowest (2).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it higher (33) than Agent 0 (21).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they have the only remaining item, and Agent 0 values it lower (4) compared to Agent 1's valuation (39).

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items, and we try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 0]
}
```
