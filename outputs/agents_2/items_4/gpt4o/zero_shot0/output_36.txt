Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3
0  10  53  98  33
1  61  88  63   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 4 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally get 2 items.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:**  
   - Item 0: 10
   - Item 1: 53
   - Item 2: 98
   - Item 3: 33

2. **Agent 1's valuations:**  
   - Item 0: 61
   - Item 1: 88
   - Item 2: 63
   - Item 3: 5

To maximize fairness, we look for an allocation that balances the total value each agent receives. We aim to maximize the valuation sum for each agent, considering the constraint that each agent gets 2 items.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Step 1:** Assign the highest valued items to each agent by comparing the valuations.

- **Step 2:** Ensure each agent receives 2 items.

Let's evaluate the items:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it more (61 vs. 10).
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it more (88 vs. 53).
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it more (98 vs. 63).
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it more (33 vs. 5).

### Fair Allocation:

- Assign Item 2 and Item 3 to Agent 0, as these are the items Agent 0 values most highly.
- Assign Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 1, as these are the items Agent 1 values most highly.

This distribution ensures that each agent receives 2 items and optimizes the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
