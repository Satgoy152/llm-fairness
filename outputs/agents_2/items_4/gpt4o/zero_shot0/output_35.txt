Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  11  69  33
1  59  73  72  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes total valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Allocation:**
   - For agent 0: Item valuations are [32, 11, 69, 33]. Total valuation = 32 + 11 + 69 + 33 = 145.
   - For agent 1: Item valuations are [59, 73, 72, 95]. Total valuation = 59 + 73 + 72 + 95 = 299.

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Each Agent's Satisfaction:**
   - Start by assigning each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation. This will help in maximizing the satisfaction for each agent.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for item 2 (69).
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for item 3 (95).
   - Now, allocate remaining items:
     - Agent 1 values item 1 at 73, which is higher than agent 0's highest remaining value.
     - Agent 1 values item 0 at 59, which leaves item 3 for agent 0.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 gets items [2, 3].
   - Agent 1 gets items [0, 1].

This ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes individual satisfaction based on given valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
