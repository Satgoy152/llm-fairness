Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  18  31  55
1  13  30  72  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent based on their preferences. Here, we have two agents and four items. We aim to assign these items such that each agent gets two items, maximizing the total value for each agent based on their given valuations.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

**Agent 0:**
- Item 0: 60
- Item 1: 18
- Item 2: 31
- Item 3: 55

**Agent 1:**
- Item 0: 13
- Item 1: 30
- Item 2: 72
- Item 3: 10

To maximize the overall satisfaction, we can use a simple greedy algorithm. Let's follow the steps:

1. Calculate the difference in valuations for each item between the two agents.
2. Sort the items based on the absolute difference in valuations.
3. Allocate items starting from the ones with the largest difference to the agent valuing them more.

**Difference in valuations:**
- Item 0: |60 - 13| = 47
- Item 1: |18 - 30| = 12
- Item 2: |31 - 72| = 41
- Item 3: |55 - 10| = 45

**Sorted items by difference:**
- Item 0: 47
- Item 3: 45
- Item 2: 41
- Item 1: 12

**Allocation:**
1. Item 0 goes to Agent 0 (higher value of 60 vs. 13).
2. Item 3 goes to Agent 0 (higher value of 55 vs. 10).
3. Item 2 goes to Agent 1 (higher value of 72 vs. 31).
4. Item 1 goes to Agent 1 (higher value of 30 vs. 18).

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2]

Now, we'll present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
