Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  30  17  17
1  11  46  99  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 46 99 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences. Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations accordingly:

Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: [1, 30, 17, 17]
- Agent 1: [11, 46, 99, 32]

Based on these valuations:
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (value of 99), so it's reasonable to allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 1 also values item 1 quite highly (value of 46), more than Agent 0 does, so item 1 should also go to Agent 1.
- This leaves items 0 and 3 to allocate to Agent 0, who has lower valuations overall, but these items are not strongly preferred by Agent 1 either.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2]

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
