Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3
0  13  51  59  61
1  97   8  78  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97  8 78 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: Items' valuations = [13, 51, 59, 61]
Agent 1: Items' valuations = [97, 8, 78, 74]
```

We need to allocate the items such that both agents receive the highest possible value according to their preferences.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 97, which is higher than Agent 0's 13.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 51, which is higher than Agent 1's 8.
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 78, which is higher than Agent 0's 59.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 74, which is higher than Agent 0's 61.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 gets Item 1 (highest valuation for this item).
   - Agent 1 gets Items 0, 2, and 3 (highest valuations for these items).

3. **Check for Fairness:**
   - Agent 0's total value: 51 (Item 1)
   - Agent 1's total value: 97 + 78 + 74 = 249 (Items 0, 2, and 3)

While Agent 1 receives significantly more value, this allocation respects the highest preference for each item. In real-world scenarios, further negotiation or compensation might be needed to address perceived fairness beyond this basic allocation.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives the items they value the most, based on their preferences.
