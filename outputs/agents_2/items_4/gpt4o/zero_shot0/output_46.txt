Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  42  10  23
1  61  35  22  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value. In this case, we have two agents and four items.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total value: \(8 + 42 + 10 + 23 = 83\)
- Agent 1's total value: \(61 + 35 + 22 + 36 = 154\)

Now, let's allocate the items to maximize fairness. We can try to allocate items in such a way that the total value each agent receives is as close as possible to proportional to their total valuation.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 8
   - Item 1: 42
   - Item 2: 10
   - Item 3: 23

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 61
   - Item 1: 35
   - Item 2: 22
   - Item 3: 36

### Allocation Process

To fairly distribute the items:

- **Agent 0** should receive the items they value more relatively:
  - Item 1 (42)
  - Item 3 (23)

- **Agent 1** should receive the items they value more relatively:
  - Item 0 (61)
  - Item 2 (22)

This allocation maximizes the perceived value each agent receives based on their preferences.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a way that respects their valuation preferences as much as possible.
