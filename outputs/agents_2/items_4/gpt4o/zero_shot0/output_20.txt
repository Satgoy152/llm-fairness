Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  63  18  50
1  57  78  75  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57 78 75 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items, aiming to maximize the total satisfaction or fairness.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [47, 63, 18, 50]
Agent 1: [57, 78, 75, 79]
```

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items to try to achieve fairness:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (57 vs. 47).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it more (78 vs. 63).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (75 vs. 18).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it more (79 vs. 50).

However, giving all items to Agent 1 would not be fair. We need to make a compromise:

- **Item 1** and **Item 3** go to Agent 1 since these have the highest differential in favor of Agent 1.
- **Item 0** and **Item 2** can go to Agent 0 to balance the allocation, as this will provide them with some value as well.

Thus, the allocation can be fairly made as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation provides both agents with two items each, and attempts to balance the total value they receive.
