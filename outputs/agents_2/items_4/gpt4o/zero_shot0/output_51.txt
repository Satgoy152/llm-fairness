Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  72  36  55
1  67  29  25  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We have 2 agents and 4 items, so each agent should receive 2 items.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Possible combinations of 2 items:
     - Items [0, 1]: Total value = 52 + 72 = 124
     - Items [0, 2]: Total value = 52 + 36 = 88
     - Items [0, 3]: Total value = 52 + 55 = 107
     - Items [1, 2]: Total value = 72 + 36 = 108
     - Items [1, 3]: Total value = 72 + 55 = 127
     - Items [2, 3]: Total value = 36 + 55 = 91

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Possible combinations of 2 items:
     - Items [0, 1]: Total value = 67 + 29 = 96
     - Items [0, 2]: Total value = 67 + 25 = 92
     - Items [0, 3]: Total value = 67 + 98 = 165
     - Items [1, 2]: Total value = 29 + 25 = 54
     - Items [1, 3]: Total value = 29 + 98 = 127
     - Items [2, 3]: Total value = 25 + 98 = 123

Let's aim for a fair allocation by maximizing the sum of values received by both agents:

- Allocate items [1, 3] to agent 1. Agent 1 gets a total value of 127.
- Allocate items [0, 2] to agent 0. Agent 0 gets a total value of 88.

This allocation seems fair as it provides a good distribution of total values:

Agent 0: Items [0, 2] => Total Value = 88  
Agent 1: Items [1, 3] => Total Value = 127

So, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
