Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0   3  93  52  87
1  97  60  84  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider their valuations for each item. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 3
  - Item 1: 93
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 87

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 60
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 92

A fair allocation could be done by assigning the items based on the higher valuation each agent has for a particular item. Let's evaluate each item:

- For Item 0, Agent 1 has a higher valuation (97 vs. 3).
- For Item 1, Agent 0 has a higher valuation (93 vs. 60).
- For Item 2, Agent 1 has a higher valuation (84 vs. 52).
- For Item 3, Agent 1 has a higher valuation (92 vs. 87).

Based on these valuations, a reasonable allocation could be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent that values it more, except for item 1, which is assigned to Agent 0 to balance the number of items between the agents.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 one item and Agent 1 three items, optimizing their total valuations, with Agent 1 getting more items but each item having higher value for them overall.
