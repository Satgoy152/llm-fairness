Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  83  82  83  62
1  85  20  94  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure a balanced distribution of the total value each agent receives. The goal is to allocate all items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 83
   - Item 1: 82
   - Item 2: 83
   - Item 3: 62

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 85
   - Item 1: 20
   - Item 2: 94
   - Item 3: 71

### Total Valuation for Each Item:
- Item 0: 83 (Agent 0) + 85 (Agent 1) = 168
- Item 1: 82 (Agent 0) + 20 (Agent 1) = 102
- Item 2: 83 (Agent 0) + 94 (Agent 1) = 177
- Item 3: 62 (Agent 0) + 71 (Agent 1) = 133

### Optimal Allocation Strategy:

To balance the distribution of the total valuation, we allocate the items based on the highest preference where possible, ensuring overall fairness.

- **Agent 0:**
  - Assign Item 1 (Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1)
  - Assign Item 3 (Agent 0 values it comparatively close to Agent 1)

- **Agent 1:**
  - Assign Item 0 (Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0)
  - Assign Item 2 (Agent 1 values it significantly higher than Agent 0)

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the agents receive items based on higher individual valuations, balancing the total satisfaction derived from the items.
