Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3
0   6  76  68  30
1  78  85  25  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their respective valuations. Given the valuation table:

```
            Items
        0   1   2   3
Agent ----------------
0       6  76  68  30
1      78  85  25  14
```

We can use a simple greedy approach to allocate the items by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most. Let's go through each item:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it at 78, while Agent 0 values it at 6. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it at 85, while Agent 0 values it at 76. Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 68, while Agent 1 values it at 25. Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 30, while Agent 1 values it at 14. Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3, while Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1. This allocation seeks to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.
