Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  27  26  41  12
1  87  44  12  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated. Given the valuations, let's try to allocate the items in a way that seems fair based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
   - Item 0: 27
   - Item 1: 26
   - Item 2: 41
   - Item 3: 12

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
   - Item 0: 87
   - Item 1: 44
   - Item 2: 12
   - Item 3: 97

To determine a fair allocation:

- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (87) and item 3 (97). Allocating these to Agent 1 maximizes their total value.
- Agent 0 values item 2 (41) the highest among their options and item 1 (26) as the next highest. Allocating these to Agent 0 maximizes their total value.

Therefore, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.

Let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
