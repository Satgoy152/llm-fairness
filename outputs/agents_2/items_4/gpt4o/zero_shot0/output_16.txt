Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  65  84  49
1  57  90  52   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as fair as possible based on the valuations provided. Since there are 4 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Here are the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 47, Agent 1 values at 57
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 65, Agent 1 values at 90
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 84, Agent 1 values at 52
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 49, Agent 1 values at 3

To allocate the items fairly, we can use the following strategy:

1. Start by looking at the highest valuation differences to allocate the items to the agent who values them the most.
2. Allocate two items to each agent.

Following this strategy:

- Item 1 has the highest valuation difference, with Agent 1 valuing it at 90 and Agent 0 at 65. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Item 2 has the next highest valuation, with Agent 0 valuing it at 84 and Agent 1 at 52. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Now, each agent should receive one more item.
- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 47, while Agent 1 values at 57. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 49, while Agent 1 values at 3. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1

So the JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
