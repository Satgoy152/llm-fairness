Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0  13  45  42  70
1  80  22  66  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [80 22 66 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use the concept of maximizing the "social welfare," which means allocating items to agents in a way that the total sum of valuations is maximized.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [13, 45, 42, 70]
Agent 1: [80, 22, 66, 76]
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 80, which is higher than Agent 0's 13. So, allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 45, which is higher than Agent 1's 22. So, allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 66, which is higher than Agent 0's 42. So, allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 76, which is higher than Agent 0's 70. So, allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

Thus, the allocation becomes:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0, 2, and 3.

Now, present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
