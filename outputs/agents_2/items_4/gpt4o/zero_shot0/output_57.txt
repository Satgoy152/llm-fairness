Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0  12  37   2  56
1  76  42  73  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we'll use the concept of maximizing the total satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

From the given valuations:
- Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 12, Item 1 = 37, Item 2 = 2, Item 3 = 56
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 76, Item 1 = 42, Item 2 = 73, Item 3 = 74

To allocate fairly, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Let's consider the following allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items: 1 and 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 0 and 3

Calculating the total value for each agent with this allocation:
- Agent 0's total value = 37 (Item 1) + 2 (Item 2) = 39
- Agent 1's total value = 76 (Item 0) + 74 (Item 3) = 150

This allocation seems fair given the significant difference in values each agent places on the items. Agent 1, who values the items more highly, receives two items with the highest values according to their preference.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
