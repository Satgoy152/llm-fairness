Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0  74  24  72  59
1  31  35  54  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 35 54 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. We have two agents and four items to allocate.

Here is the valuation table again for reference:

```
Agent\Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3
-----------|----|----|----|----
Agent 0    | 74 | 24 | 72 | 59
Agent 1    | 31 | 35 | 54 | 42
```

Let's try to allocate the items by maximizing the total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 0 (74) and Item 2 (72).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: Item 2 (54) and Item 3 (42).

To allocate fairly, we aim to ensure each agent receives a reasonable share of their valued items:

- **Agent 0** gets Item 0 and Item 2.
- **Agent 1** gets Item 1 and Item 3.

This allocation gives each agent a reasonably fair share of their valued items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 74 (Item 0) + 72 (Item 2) = 146
- Total value for Agent 1: 35 (Item 1) + 42 (Item 3) = 77

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
