Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  14  93  22
1  46  92  92  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives two items (since there are 4 items in total). We can approach this by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.

Let's evaluate the values each agent has for each item:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 93
  - Item 3: 22

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 46
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 92
  - Item 3: 96

To maximize the total value for each agent, we can follow a greedy approach where we assign the items based on which agent values them more:

1. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 also values it at 92. Assign to Agent 0 for the higher value.
2. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 22, Agent 1 values it at 96. Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 46. Assign to Agent 0.
4. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 14, Agent 1 values it at 92. Assign to Agent 1.

This allocation gives each agent two items, with Agent 0 receiving items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 receiving items 1 and 3.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the distribution is based on maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive.
