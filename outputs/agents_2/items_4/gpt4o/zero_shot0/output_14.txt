Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  86  63  77   5
1  50  78  26  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, we have 2 agents and 4 items.

Let's first examine the valuation table:

```
    Items
    0   1   2   3
0  86  63  77   5
1  50  78  26  73
```

One potential method to allocate the items is to use a "maximum matching" approach, where we allocate items to agents based on the highest valuation available, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Item 0: 86
   - Item 1: 63
   - Item 2: 77
   - Item 3: 5

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Item 0: 50
   - Item 1: 78
   - Item 2: 26
   - Item 3: 73

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this the highest (86), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this the highest (78), so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this the highest (77), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this the highest (73), so allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's check if each agent receives an integer number of items. Each agent receives 2 items, which is an integer number. The allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 3

Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
