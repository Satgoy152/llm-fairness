Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  61  38  84
1  23  54  74  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 4 items and 2 agents, each agent will receive 2 items.

Let's start with the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 97
- Item 1: 61
- Item 2: 38
- Item 3: 84

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 23
- Item 1: 54
- Item 2: 74
- Item 3: 89

One approach is to allocate the items such that each agent gets the highest possible value based on their preferences.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. Assign items based on each agent's highest values.

For Agent 0, the highest valuations are for:
- Item 0: 97
- Item 3: 84

For Agent 1, the highest valuations are for:
- Item 3: 89
- Item 2: 74

We can see that both agents value Item 3 highly. However, Agent 1 values Item 3 more than Agent 0. A potential allocation considering fairness could be:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0 and Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2 and Item 3.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent under this allocation:

- Agent 0: 97 (Item 0) + 61 (Item 1) = 158
- Agent 1: 74 (Item 2) + 89 (Item 3) = 163

This allocation provides a fairly balanced distribution of total valuations between the two agents.

Therefore, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
