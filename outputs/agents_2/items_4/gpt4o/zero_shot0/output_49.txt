Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3
0  14  41  51  55
1  87  23  14  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 4 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [14, 41, 51, 55]
Agent 1: [87, 23, 14, 31]
```

To maximize fairness, we aim to assign items such that each agent's total valuation is maximized under the constraint that each agent receives 2 items. We can consider the following allocation options:

1. Calculate the sum of values for each possible pair of items for each agent.
   
- For Agent 0:
  - Items (0, 1): 14 + 41 = 55
  - Items (0, 2): 14 + 51 = 65
  - Items (0, 3): 14 + 55 = 69
  - Items (1, 2): 41 + 51 = 92
  - Items (1, 3): 41 + 55 = 96
  - Items (2, 3): 51 + 55 = 106

- For Agent 1:
  - Items (0, 1): 87 + 23 = 110
  - Items (0, 2): 87 + 14 = 101
  - Items (0, 3): 87 + 31 = 118
  - Items (1, 2): 23 + 14 = 37
  - Items (1, 3): 23 + 31 = 54
  - Items (2, 3): 14 + 31 = 45

2. Select the allocations that maximize the sum of values for each agent:

- For Agent 0, the best pair is items (2, 3) with a total valuation of 106.
- For Agent 1, the best pair is items (0, 3) with a total valuation of 118.

However, item 3 is in both allocations, so we need to adjust to ensure no overlap in items. Let's try another combination:

- Allocate items (1, 2) to Agent 1 with a total valuation of 37.
- Allocate items (0, 3) to Agent 0 with a total valuation of 69.

Now, each agent gets two items, and there is no overlap. This allocation ensures each agent maximizes their valuation given the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
