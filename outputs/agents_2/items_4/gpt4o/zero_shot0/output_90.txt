Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3
0  39  60  56  24
1  54  64  17   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the two agents, we can start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items and then try to distribute the items so that the total value is balanced between the agents.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Valuations

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0:** 39 (Item 0) + 60 (Item 1) + 56 (Item 2) + 24 (Item 3) = 179
- **Agent 1:** 54 (Item 0) + 64 (Item 1) + 17 (Item 2) + 8 (Item 3) = 143

### Step 2: Fair Allocation of Items

The goal is to allocate items so that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible. Since there are only two agents, each should receive two items.

Let's analyze different combinations:

#### Option A:
- **Agent 0:** Item 0 (39) and Item 1 (60) = 99
- **Agent 1:** Item 2 (17) and Item 3 (8) = 25

The total valuation is heavily skewed towards Agent 0 in this option.

#### Option B:
- **Agent 0:** Item 0 (39) and Item 2 (56) = 95
- **Agent 1:** Item 1 (64) and Item 3 (8) = 72

This option is more balanced than Option A but still favors Agent 0.

#### Option C:
- **Agent 0:** Item 0 (39) and Item 3 (24) = 63
- **Agent 1:** Item 1 (64) and Item 2 (17) = 81

This option is closer, but Agent 1 has a slightly higher total valuation.

#### Option D:
- **Agent 0:** Item 1 (60) and Item 2 (56) = 116
- **Agent 1:** Item 0 (54) and Item 3 (8) = 62

This option favors Agent 0 significantly.

### Step 3: Choose the Most Balanced Option

Option C seems to be the most balanced approach, with Agent 0 receiving Items 0 and 3, while Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

### Final Allocation

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the perceived values each agent gets from the items.
