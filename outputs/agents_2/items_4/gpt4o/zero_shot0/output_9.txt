Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  45  45  34
1  79  80  59  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's consider the valuations and calculate the best allocation.

Here are the valuations:
```
Agent 0: 
Item 0: 91
Item 1: 45
Item 2: 45
Item 3: 34

Agent 1: 
Item 0: 79
Item 1: 80
Item 2: 59
Item 3: 23
```

We need to find a fair allocation that maximizes the total value for both agents. A common approach is to use the "maximum sum of valuations" method, where we try to allocate items in a way that maximizes the sum of each agent's valuations for the items they receive.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values Item 0 the most, with a valuation of 91. Agent 1 values Item 1 the most, with a valuation of 80.
2. For Agent 0, the next highest valuations are Item 1 and Item 2, both valued at 45. For Agent 1, the next highest valuation is Item 2, valued at 59.
3. Agent 0 might prefer Item 0 and one of Items 1 or 2. Agent 1 would likely prefer Item 1 and Item 2.

To maximize fairness, let's try this allocation:
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Items 1 and 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocations:
- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

The total valuations are:
- Agent 0: 91 (Item 0) + 34 (Item 3) = 125
- Agent 1: 80 (Item 1) + 59 (Item 2) = 139

These allocations ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and the sum of the valuations is maximized for fairness.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
