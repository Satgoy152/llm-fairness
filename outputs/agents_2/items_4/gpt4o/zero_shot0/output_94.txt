Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  48  99  78
1  93  72  49  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 4 48 99 78]
 [93 72 49 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. We have 2 agents (0 and 1) and 4 items (0, 1, 2, and 3). Let's analyze the valuation table and allocate the items:

### Valuation Table:
- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 4
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 78
- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 49
  - Item 3: 88

### Allocation Strategy:
We aim to maximize the satisfaction for each agent by considering their highest valued items while ensuring each agent gets an equal or nearly equal number of items (2 items each in this case).

#### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Items 2 (value 99) and 3 (value 78)
- **Agent 1**:
  - Items 0 (value 93) and 1 (value 72)

This allocation gives:

- **Agent 0**: Total value = 99 + 78 = 177
- **Agent 1**: Total value = 93 + 72 = 165

This distribution is fairly balanced considering their preferences.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
