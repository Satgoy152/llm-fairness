Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  19  57  58  17
1  60  34  74   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [60 34 74  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. In this problem, we have 2 agents and 4 items. Let's analyze the values and allocate accordingly.

Valuation Table:
```
    Items
    0   1   2   3
0  19  57  58  17
1  60  34  74   4
```

- Agent 0 values items as follows: Item 0 = 19, Item 1 = 57, Item 2 = 58, Item 3 = 17
- Agent 1 values items as follows: Item 0 = 60, Item 1 = 34, Item 2 = 74, Item 3 = 4

To maximize fairness, we may want to consider assigning items based on the highest values each agent places on them. Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 2** (most valued by Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1
   - Agent 1 values it at 74, which is the highest value for this item.

2. **Item 0** (next highest value): Assign to Agent 1
   - Agent 1 values it at 60, which is higher than Agent 0's value of 19.

3. **Item 1** (next highest value): Assign to Agent 0
   - Agent 0 values it at 57, which is higher than Agent 1's value of 34.

4. **Item 3** (last item): Assign to Agent 0
   - Agent 0 values it at 17, which is higher than Agent 1's value of 4.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 0]
}
```
