Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0  1   2   3
0  86  4  77  18
1   9  0  72  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that maximizes overall satisfaction or minimizes envy among the agents. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Valuation for items: [86, 4, 77, 18]
   - For Agent 0, item 0 has the highest value (86), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Next, item 2 has the second-highest value (77) for Agent 0, so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Valuation for items: [9, 0, 72, 77]
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is for item 3 (77), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Next, item 2 has a high value (72) for Agent 1, but it's already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is item 0 (9), but it's also taken. Therefore, allocate the remaining item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Final Allocation:**  
   - With this allocation, Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3.

### JSON Output of Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets two items and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.
