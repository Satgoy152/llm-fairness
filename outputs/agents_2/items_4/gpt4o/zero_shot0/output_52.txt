Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  13  35   0
1  95  64  18  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 64 18 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given the valuation matrix, we can use a method like the "Hungarian algorithm" or other optimization techniques aimed at maximizing value for each agent.

Let's break down the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0:
Item 0: 48
Item 1: 13
Item 2: 35
Item 3: 0

Agent 1:
Item 0: 95
Item 1: 64
Item 2: 18
Item 3: 60
```

We want to allocate these items such that the allocation is fair and each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's explore a scenario where we try to maximize the value for each agent:

- Agent 1 highly values Item 0, so it would be beneficial for Agent 1 to receive Item 0.
- Agent 0 values Item 2 significantly higher than the others, so it would make sense to allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 also values Item 3 significantly, so this could be allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 1 is valued more by Agent 1 than Agent 0, so it might be sensible for Agent 1 to take Item 1.

Proposed allocation based on maximum value:

- Agent 0 receives: Item 2 (Value = 35)
- Agent 1 receives: Item 0, Item 1, Item 3 (Values = 95, 64, 60)

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 35 and Agent 1 a total value of 219.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
