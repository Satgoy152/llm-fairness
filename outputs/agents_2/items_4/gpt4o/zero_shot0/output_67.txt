Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3
0  38  87  24  11
1  79  27  53  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [38, 87, 24, 11]
Agent 1: [79, 27, 53, 83]
```

We need to allocate items 0, 1, 2, and 3 between two agents such that each agent gets a fair share.

Let's consider the value each agent has for each item and try to maximize the overall satisfaction by allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 38
   - Agent 1 values it at 79
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 87
   - Agent 1 values it at 27
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 24
   - Agent 1 values it at 53
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 11
   - Agent 1 values it at 83
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 3]

In JSON format, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
