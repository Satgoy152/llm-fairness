Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0  93  22  17  65
1   6  87  66  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

First, let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 22
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 65

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 6
  - Item 1: 87
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 80

The goal is to allocate these items in a way that both agents are satisfied, and the total value is maximized for each agent.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Start with the highest value item for each agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest value is Item 0 (93)
   - Agent 1's highest value is Item 1 (87)

2. **Allocate the highest value items to each agent first:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items based on next highest value:**
   - For Agent 0, the next highest valued item is Item 3 (65).
   - For Agent 1, the next highest valued item is Item 3 (80), but since Item 3 is the next highest for both agents, we need to consider balance.
   - Agent 0 has Item 0 (93), and Agent 1 has Item 1 (87) so far.
  
4. **Look for balance and total value distribution:**
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 considering the total values are close (Agent 0: 93, Agent 1: 87+80=167).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 as the remaining item.

Now, each agent has two items, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, while Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
