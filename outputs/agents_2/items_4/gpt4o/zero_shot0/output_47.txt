Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  84  47  86
1  95  36  45  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We have two agents and four items, so each agent should receive two items. Hereâ€™s how we can allocate the items:

1. List the valuations of each agent for each item:

   - Agent 0: [75, 84, 47, 86]
   - Agent 1: [95, 36, 45, 85]

2. Calculate the total value each agent would receive for all possible combinations of two items. We aim to maximize these values for each agent.

3. Consider the combinations and their total valuations:

   - Agent 0:
     - Items (0, 1): 75 + 84 = 159
     - Items (0, 2): 75 + 47 = 122
     - Items (0, 3): 75 + 86 = 161
     - Items (1, 2): 84 + 47 = 131
     - Items (1, 3): 84 + 86 = 170
     - Items (2, 3): 47 + 86 = 133

   - Agent 1:
     - Items (0, 1): 95 + 36 = 131
     - Items (0, 2): 95 + 45 = 140
     - Items (0, 3): 95 + 85 = 180
     - Items (1, 2): 36 + 45 = 81
     - Items (1, 3): 36 + 85 = 121
     - Items (2, 3): 45 + 85 = 130

4. Choose the combination that maximizes the total valuation for both agents without overlap:

   - Agent 0 receives items (1, 3) for a total value of 170.
   - Agent 1 receives items (0, 2) for a total value of 140.

After checking for overlaps and ensuring all items are allocated, we can present the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
