Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0  29  94  12  66
1  79  91   8  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Since there are two agents and four items, each agent should receive two items. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the valuations for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0 (29), 1 (94), 2 (12), 3 (66)
   - Agent 1: Items 0 (79), 1 (91), 2 (8), 3 (96)

2. **Consider the total value each agent is receiving:**
   - We want to maximize the value for each agent.

3. **Try different combinations to maximize the value:**
   - For Agent 0, the highest values are for items 1 (94) and 3 (66).
   - For Agent 1, the highest values are for items 3 (96) and 1 (91).

4. **Find the optimal allocation:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Now, allocate item 0 to Agent 1 and item 2 to Agent 0.

5. **Check the total values for this allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 (94) and 2 (12), totaling 106.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 (79) and 3 (96), totaling 175.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and the allocation is relatively fair based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
