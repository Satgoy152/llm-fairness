Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  24  28  20  43
1  91  10  60   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [91 10 60  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, I'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for each item. The table gives the following valuations:

```
Agent 0: [24, 28, 20, 43]
Agent 1: [91, 10, 60, 2]
```

One approach to achieve fairness is to allocate items in a manner that maximizes the total value each agent gets, taking into account their preferences. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1: Valuation of 28
   - Item 3: Valuation of 43

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 0: Valuation of 91
   - Item 2: Valuation of 60

Let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0's total value**: 28 + 43 = 71
- **Agent 1's total value**: 91 + 60 = 151

Now, I'll present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items based on their preferences, with Agent 1 receiving the items that they value most highly overall, and Agent 0 receiving the next best set of items according to their preferences.
