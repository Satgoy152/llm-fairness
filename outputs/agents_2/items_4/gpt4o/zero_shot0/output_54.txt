Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  98  89  42  38
1  42  92  94  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [42 92 94 43]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. In this case, we have two agents and four items to allocate.

We should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring fairness. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items, considering the constraints.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [98, 89, 42, 38]
Agent 1: [42, 92, 94, 43]
```

Let's examine the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Prefers items with the highest value: 0 (98), then 1 (89).
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Prefers items with the highest value: 2 (94), then 1 (92).

### Allocation Strategy:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.

This allocation maximizes the individual values for the items that each agent can have:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Values: 98 (item 0) + 38 (item 3) = 136 total value.
  
- **Agent 1:**
  - Values: 92 (item 1) + 94 (item 2) = 186 total value.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and each agent's total value is as high as possible given the constraints.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
