Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  55  13  91
1  60  82  41  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 4 items and 2 agents, each agent should receive 2 items. Here's how we can approach the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Possible Allocation:**
   - Agent 0's valuations: [61, 55, 13, 91]
   - Agent 1's valuations: [60, 82, 41, 80]

2. **Consider Possible Allocations:**
   - Identify the highest value allocations for each agent, keeping in mind both agents need to get 2 items.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - We could start by giving each agent their highest valued items and adjust accordingly.

4. **Example Allocation:**
   - **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 3 (91) and item 0 (61), totaling 152.
   - **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 1 (82) and item 2 (41), totaling 123.

Thus, the allocation can be done as follows:
- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3]
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2]

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
