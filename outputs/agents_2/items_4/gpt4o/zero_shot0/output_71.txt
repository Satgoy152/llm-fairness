Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  65  22  82  65
1  81  77  96   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for both agents while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. Let's break down the process:

1. **Valuation Table:**

   | Agent/Item | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
   |------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
   | Agent 0    | 65     | 22     | 82     | 65     |
   | Agent 1    | 81     | 77     | 96     | 0      |

2. **Allocation Strategy:**

   - We want to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as high as possible.
   - We also have to ensure each agent gets at least one item since there are two agents and four items.

3. **Step-by-Step Allocation:**

   - **Item 2** has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (96), so we allocate it to Agent 1.
   - **Item 0** has a higher valuation for Agent 1 (81) compared to Agent 0 (65), so we allocate it to Agent 1.
   - **Item 1** has a higher valuation for Agent 1 (77) compared to Agent 0 (22), but Agent 1 already has two items, so Agent 0 gets Item 1.
   - **Item 3** has a higher valuation for Agent 0 (65) compared to Agent 1 (0), so we allocate it to Agent 0.

4. **Final Allocations:**

   - Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.

5. **JSON Format Output:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
