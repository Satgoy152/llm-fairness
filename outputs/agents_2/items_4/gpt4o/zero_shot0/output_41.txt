Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0  11  26  16  35
1  93  48  13  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are only 2 agents and 4 items, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's evaluate the situation:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 11
- Item 1: 26
- Item 2: 16
- Item 3: 35

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 93
- Item 1: 48
- Item 2: 13
- Item 3: 82

To allocate fairly, we can look for combinations that maximize each agent's satisfaction.

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Allocate item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 11
   - Agent 1 values it at 93

   Item 0 should go to Agent 1 as they have a significantly higher valuation.

2. **Allocate item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 26
   - Agent 1 values it at 48

   Item 1 should go to Agent 1 as they have a higher valuation.

3. **Allocate item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 13

   Item 2 should go to Agent 0 as they have a higher valuation.

4. **Allocate item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 35
   - Agent 1 values it at 82

   Item 3 should go to Agent 1 as they have a significantly higher valuation.

Now, let's check the assignments:

- Agent 0 receives items 2
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 3

To ensure that each agent gets exactly 2 items, let's re-evaluate the allocations:

Let's swap item 1 with item 3:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3

This allocation gives each agent exactly 2 items and maximizes their satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Finally, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
