Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  25  58  81
1  23   7  51  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method like maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Given the values:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 91 | 25 | 58 | 81 |
| 1          | 23 |  7 | 51 | 57 |

Let's analyze the total valuation for each item by each agent:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values at 91, Agent 1 values at 23.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values at 25, Agent 1 values at 7.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values at 58, Agent 1 values at 51.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values at 81, Agent 1 values at 57.

To maximize fairness and total value, a logical approach is to allocate items with higher valuations to the corresponding agent, ensuring each agent gets two items:

1. **Agent 0** should take items that have high valuations for them, which are:
   - Item 0 (91) and Item 3 (81).

2. **Agent 1** should take items that have higher relative value for them or what is left, which are:
   - Item 1 (7) and Item 2 (51).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and the total value each agent receives is relatively balanced based on their valuations.
