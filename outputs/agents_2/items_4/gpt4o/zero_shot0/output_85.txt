Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  91  83  75
1   0  67  65   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will use the given valuation matrix. The goal is to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and ideally, we want to maximize the total value for each agent.

Given the matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  47  91  83  75
1   0  67  65   9
```

We can start by considering which items each agent values the most and allocate them accordingly:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 1 has the highest value (91).
  - Item 2 has the second-highest value (83).
  - Item 3 also has a high value (75).

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Item 1 has a value of 67.
  - Item 2 has a value of 65.
  - Item 3 has a value of 9.
  - Item 0 has a value of 0.

To maximize fairness, we can allocate items as follows:

1. Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2, which are highly valued by them.
2. Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3, making the best use of their values.

This allocation attempts to balance the total values they receive:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 2. Total value = 91 + 83 = 174
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 and 3. Total value = 0 + 9 = 9

Since this allocation results in a significant imbalance if Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3, let's try another allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3.
2. Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.

This results in:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 3. Total value = 91 + 75 = 166
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 and 2. Total value = 0 + 65 = 65

This allocation is more balanced but still favors Agent 0 in terms of total valuation. However, given the constraints, the allocation is fair in terms of the number of items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
