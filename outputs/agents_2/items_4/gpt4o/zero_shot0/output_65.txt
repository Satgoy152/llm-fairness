Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3
0  43  78  24  52
1  45  51  70  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple approach where we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given the valuations of the two agents for the four items, we'll try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 43 
  - Item 1: 78 
  - Item 2: 24 
  - Item 3: 52

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 70
  - Item 3: 58

A simple approach to ensure fair allocation is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through each item:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 45, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 43. So, allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 78, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 51. So, allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 70, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 24. So, allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 58, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 52. So, allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives Item 1, and Agent 1 receives Items 0, 2, and 3. This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, maximizing fairness based on the provided valuations.
