Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3
0  66  83  41  33
1  10  68  82  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [10 68 82 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. We have two agents (0 and 1) and four items (0, 1, 2, 3). Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 66
- Item 1: 83
- Item 2: 41
- Item 3: 33

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 10
- Item 1: 68
- Item 2: 82
- Item 3: 97

To maximize fairness in allocation, we can use a method like the Hungarian algorithm or simply allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total value. Let's proceed with the manual approach here for simplicity:

1. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 1 (97), so allocate it to Agent 1.
2. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0 (83), so allocate it to Agent 0.
3. Out of the remaining items (0 and 2), Agent 0 values Item 0 more than Item 2 (66 vs 41), and Agent 1 values Item 2 more than Item 0 (82 vs 10). Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, the allocation would be:
- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3

The JSON format for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
