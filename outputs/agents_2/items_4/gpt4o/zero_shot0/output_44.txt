Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  31  61  36  64
1   4   3  36  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can use a method called "Envy-Free Allocation" or "Proportional Fairness". Here, we aim to ensure each agent receives items such that no agent would prefer the other's bundle over their own. 

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 31
- Item 1: 61
- Item 2: 36
- Item 3: 64
Total: 31 + 61 + 36 + 64 = 192

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 4
- Item 1: 3
- Item 2: 36
- Item 3: 92
Total: 4 + 3 + 36 + 92 = 135

The task is to allocate the items such that each agent gets items that are at least proportional to their total value. Since we're dealing with only two agents and four items, a simple way to allocate fairly is to focus on maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items:

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (valued at 64)
   - Second highest: Item 1 (valued at 61)
   - Allocate Items 3 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (valued at 92), but already allocated to Agent 0
   - Allocate Item 2 (valued at 36) to Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 0 (valued at 4) to Agent 1.

Now, both agents have received items based on their preferences, and each has been given items that maximize their valuations.

**Final allocation in the requested JSON format**:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
