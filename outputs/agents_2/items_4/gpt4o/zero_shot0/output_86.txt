Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3
0  25  89  34   2
1  50  17  29  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will need to consider a method that ensures each agent receives an integer number of items while taking into account their valuations. A common approach is to use a method called "maximizing envy-freeness" or the "maximum valuations method," aiming to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **List the items with their valuations for each agent:**

   - Agent 0:
     - Item 0: 25
     - Item 1: 89
     - Item 2: 34
     - Item 3: 2
   - Agent 1:
     - Item 0: 50
     - Item 1: 17
     - Item 2: 29
     - Item 3: 30

2. **Determine which items each agent values most.** This helps in ensuring that each agent receives items that they value highly.

3. **Allocate items based on their highest valuation to each agent.** We can do this by seeing which agent values each item more and assign it accordingly:

   - Compare the valuations for each item between the two agents:
     - Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 50, whereas Agent 0 values it at 25. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
     - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 89, whereas Agent 1 values it at 17. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
     - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 34, whereas Agent 1 values it at 29. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
     - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 30, whereas Agent 0 values it at 2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

4. **Finalize allocation:**

   - Agent 0 receives items: [1, 2]
   - Agent 1 receives items: [0, 3]

Now, we present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
