Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  66  17  42
1  78  82  99  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Given that we have two agents and four items, each agent should ideally receive two items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent within the constraint of distributing all items.

First, let's list the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 42

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 48

We can use the following approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item:** 
   - Item 0: 89 (Agent 0) + 78 (Agent 1) = 167
   - Item 1: 66 (Agent 0) + 82 (Agent 1) = 148
   - Item 2: 17 (Agent 0) + 99 (Agent 1) = 116
   - Item 3: 42 (Agent 0) + 48 (Agent 1) = 90

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Individual Valuation:**
   - Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 (99), so allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 0 is valued highly by Agent 0 (89), so allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 1 is valued highly by Agent 1 (82), so allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3 is left for Agent 0.

The final allocation will ensure each agent receives two items:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.

Now, present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
