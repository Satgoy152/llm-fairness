Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3
0  22  93  20  11
1   9  23  90  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents, we want to consider the valuations they have for each item. Our goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each item is allocated to one agent only, and each agent should receive an integer number of items.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0: 
- Item 0: 22
- Item 1: 93
- Item 2: 20
- Item 3: 11

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 9
- Item 1: 23
- Item 2: 90
- Item 3: 39

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 93.
   - Agent 1 values it at 23.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 20.
   - Agent 1 values it at 90.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 11.
   - Agent 1 values it at 39.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 22.
   - Agent 1 values it at 9.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

This results in:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
