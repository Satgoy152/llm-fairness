Input:

    The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  41   0  59
1  20  15  32  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2],
        "1": [3,4],
        "2": [5,6,7]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent. 
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent. Let's analyze the given valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   48   |   41   |   0    |   59   |
|   1   |   20   |   15   |   32   |   82   |

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation each agent has for each item:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 48.
   - Agent 1 values it at 20.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 41.
   - Agent 1 values it at 15.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 0.
   - Agent 1 values it at 32.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59.
   - Agent 1 values it at 82.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

Based on this allocation strategy, here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
