Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  58   6  97
1   2  73  88  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we will aim for an allocation that approaches envy-freeness. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over that of the other agent based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [73, 58, 6, 97]
- Agent 1's valuations: [2, 73, 88, 87]

Our goal is to allocate all 4 items such that:

1. Each agent gets at least 2 items since there are 4 items and 2 agents.
2. The allocation is as envy-free as possible.

First, let's consider the highest-valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (97), followed by item 0 (73).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (88), followed by item 3 (87).

Given this, a potential fair allocation that minimizes envy might be:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 because it is their highest valued item.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because it is their highest valued item.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 1):

- Between the remaining items 0 and 1, Agent 0 values item 0 higher (73 vs 58).
- Agent 1 values item 1 higher (73 vs 2).

Thus, allocating item 0 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1 seems reasonable:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 0.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 1.

This allocation gives each agent two items and aims to minimize envy by giving each agent their highest-valued available items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 1]
}
```
