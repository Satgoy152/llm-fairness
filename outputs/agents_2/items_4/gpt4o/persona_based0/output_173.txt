Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3
0  57  44  80  20
1  26  16  92  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their valuations. One common approach is to use an algorithm like the "Envy-Free up to One Good" (EF1) allocation, which guarantees that any envy an agent might feel towards another's allocation can be mitigated by removing at most one item from the other's bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 57     | 44     | 80     | 20     |
| 1     | 26     | 16     | 92     | 90     |

Agent 0 values:
- Item 0: 57
- Item 1: 44
- Item 2: 80
- Item 3: 20

Agent 1 values:
- Item 0: 26
- Item 1: 16
- Item 2: 92
- Item 3: 90

Given these valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items such that each agent receives a similar total value and the allocation is perceived as fair:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because they value it highly (92).
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 because they value it highly (90).
3. Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0, as these items total a high value for them (57 + 44 = 101).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1, with total value = 57 + 44 = 101
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3, with total value = 92 + 90 = 182

Although Agent 1 receives a higher total value, each agent has received their most preferred items given the constraint of having at least two items each, and this allocation minimizes envy under the circumstances.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
