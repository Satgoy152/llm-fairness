Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  12  42  25  50
1   1  93  34  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 1 93 34 93]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items and feels they have received as much value as possible given their preferences.

The valuation matrix is:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  12  42  25  50
1   1  93  34  93
```

The total items available are 4, and there are 2 agents.

First, let's compute the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(12 + 42 + 25 + 50 = 129\)
- Agent 1: \(1 + 93 + 34 + 93 = 221\)

Next, consider allocating items based on maximizing individual preferences while ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair share.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 50
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 93
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

2. **Allocate Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 42
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 93
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

3. **Allocate Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 25
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 34
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (higher valuation).

4. **Allocate Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 12
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 1
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (higher valuation).

### Resulting Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 2, and 3

In this allocation, each agent has received items according to their preferences as much as possible, given the constraint of integer division.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
