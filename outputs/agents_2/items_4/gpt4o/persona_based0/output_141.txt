Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3
0  15  47  57  46
1  63  22  25  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [63 22 25 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents with the aim of minimizing envy, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [15, 47, 57, 46]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [63, 22, 25, 44]

To achieve envy-freeness, we can try to maximize the total perceived value each agent receives while ensuring they feel they have a fair allocation compared to the other agent.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: 
   - Highest value for item 2 (57)
   - Second highest value for item 1 (47)
   - Third highest value for item 3 (46)
   - Lowest value for item 0 (15)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest value for item 0 (63)
   - Second highest value for item 3 (44)
   - Third highest value for item 2 (25)
   - Lowest value for item 1 (22)

### Proposed Allocation

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Items 1 and 2 (valuations: 47 and 57)

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Items 0 and 3 (valuations: 63 and 44)

This allocation ensures that:

- Agent 0 receives items with a total personal value of 104 (47 + 57).
- Agent 1 receives items with a total personal value of 107 (63 + 44).

Both agents receive a high total value from their perspective, and the allocation tries to minimize envy by giving each agent items they highly value relative to the other agent's valuation.

### JSON Format Output

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents feel they have received a fair distribution of items based on their individual valuations.
