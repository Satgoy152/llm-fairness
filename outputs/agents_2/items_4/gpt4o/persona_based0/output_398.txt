Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  53  40  24  61
1  28  11  88  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free or as close as possible, we need to consider the agents' valuations of the items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their own valuation. 

Let's analyze the table of valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 53     | 40     | 24     | 61     |
| 1     | 28     | 11     | 88     | 49     |

We can calculate each agent's total valuation of all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 53 + 40 + 24 + 61 = 178
- Agent 1's total valuation: 28 + 11 + 88 + 49 = 176

For a fair allocation, we should aim to allocate items so that each agent's share is proportional to their total valuation. Given that there are 4 items, each item should ideally represent approximately 1/4 of the total valuation for each agent.

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Item 2** is highly valued by Agent 1 (88), so it makes sense to allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 3** is the most valuable for Agent 0 (61), so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 0** is the next highest valued by Agent 0 (53), so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 1** can be allocated to Agent 1 because it balances Agent 1's overall share, considering they already received Item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and the distribution is approximately proportional to their valuations.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 4 items are allocated, with each agent receiving items they value significantly, thereby minimizing envy and achieving a fair distribution.
