Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  57  82  20
1  98  23   0  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1) while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize each agent's satisfaction given the constraints. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 52
   - Item 1: 57
   - Item 2: 82
   - Item 3: 20

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 98
   - Item 1: 23
   - Item 2: 0
   - Item 3: 66

3. **Analysis:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (82), followed by Item 1 (57).
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest (98), followed by Item 3 (66).
   
4. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).

5. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items left are 1 and 3.

6. **Secondary Allocation:**
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0 after Item 2).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1 after Item 0).

This allocation gives each agent two items, and both agents receive items that are among their top preferences, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
