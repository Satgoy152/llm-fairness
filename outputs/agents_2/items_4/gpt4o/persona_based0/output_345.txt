Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  84  25  84  20
1  36   0  50  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we will use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. For two agents and four items, we can find an envy-free allocation by comparing the valuations of the items.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0: [84, 25, 84, 20]  
Agent 1: [36, 0, 50, 56]

We aim to allocate the items such that neither agent envies the other. Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 0 and 2 equally high at 84, and item 1 at 25 and item 3 at 20.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 56, followed by item 2 at 50, item 0 at 36, and item 1 at 0.

A potential allocation could be:

1. Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0, as these are the highest valued items for Agent 0.
2. Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 1, as item 3 is the highest valued item for Agent 1, and item 1 has no value to Agent 1 but is necessary to ensure each agent gets two items.

Under this allocation, neither agent would prefer the other's allocation to their own:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, valued at 84 each, for a total value of 168.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3, valued at 0 and 56, for a total value of 56.

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0 would not want to swap with Agent 1, because Agent 0 would receive a total value of 56 with Agent 1's items, compared to 168 with their own items.
- Agent 1 would not want to swap with Agent 0, because Agent 1 would receive a total value of 72 with Agent 0's items, compared to 56 with their own items.

Thus, the allocation is envy-free.

The allocations in the requested JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
