Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0  62  22  31   6
1  87   2  13  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own according to their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [62, 22, 31, 6]
- Agent 1 values: [87, 2, 13, 14]

A strategy to achieve an envy-free allocation is to allocate items based on each agent's highest-valued remaining item, ensuring that each agent receives an equal number of items or as close as possible. Since there are two agents and four items, each agent should receive two items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Allocate the highest-valued item to each agent alternately:**

   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 87. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 62, but it's already taken. Next highest for Agent 0 is item 2 at 31. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Next, Agent 1's highest remaining value is for item 3 at 14. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Finally, Agent 0 values item 1 at 22. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 1, with valuations 31 and 22.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3, with valuations 87 and 14.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value relative to the remaining items, and it aims to minimize envy. Agent 0 has a total valuation of 53, and Agent 1 has a total valuation of 101, but each agent is given their next best options available sequentially.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation respects the conditions of the problem and aims for fairness within the constraints of integer item allocations.
