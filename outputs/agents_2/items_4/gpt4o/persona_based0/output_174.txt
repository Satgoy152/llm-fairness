Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3
0  39  79  72  83
1  65  72  37  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve a division that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible. Here are the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 79
  - Item 2: 72
  - Item 3: 83

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 3: 26

One approach to ensure fairness is to allocate items such that each agent receives a roughly equal total valuation of their allocated items. We can use a method like "envy-freeness up to one item" (EF1), which ensures that any envy can be removed by removing one item from the more envied bundle.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each item and aim for allocations where the total values are as balanced as possible for each agent.

1. **Calculate the total value each agent can get from items:**
   - Agent 0: 39 + 79 + 72 + 83 = 273
   - Agent 1: 65 + 72 + 37 + 26 = 200

2. **Assign items to maximize fairness:**
   - Start by giving Agent 0 the item with the highest value to them and then proceed similarly for Agent 1.
   - Balance the remaining items by their value differences to minimize envy.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (value 83), Item 2 (value 72)
   - Agent 1: Item 0 (value 65), Item 1 (value 72)

4. **Check total valuation for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: 83 + 72 = 155
   - Agent 1: 65 + 72 = 137

This allocation is close to fair given the constraints and ensures that both agents have a similar valuation from their allocated items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
