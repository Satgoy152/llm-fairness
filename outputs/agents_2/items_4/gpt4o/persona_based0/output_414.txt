Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3
0  88  97  14   0
1  58  66   4  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items in a way that is fair and aims to be envy-free, let's consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value, aiming to minimize envy.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: [88, 97, 14, 0]
- Agent 1: [58, 66, 4, 95]

A straightforward approach to reduce envy is to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. The key is to assign items to agents such that the sum of their valuations for the items they receive is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 88.
   - Agent 1 values it at 58.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 97.
   - Agent 1 values it at 66.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 14.
   - Agent 1 values it at 4.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 0.
   - Agent 1 values it at 95.

A possible fair allocation could aim to maximize the total perceived values for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to allocate:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, since it is the highest valued item for this agent.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, since it is the highest valued item for this agent.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the next highest valued item.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, since Agent 0 values it less.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they highly value, thus minimizing potential envy.

The resulting allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items 0 and 1, which they value at 88 and 97, respectively. Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3, valued at 4 and 95, respectively. This allocation aims to balance the total value perceived by each agent.
