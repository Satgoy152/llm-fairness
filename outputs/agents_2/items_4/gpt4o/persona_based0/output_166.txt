Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  10  78   5  54
1  25   4  50   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is envy-free (or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints), we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (10), Item 1 (78), Item 2 (5), Item 3 (54)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (25), Item 1 (4), Item 2 (50), Item 3 (5)

An envy-free allocation aims to ensure that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle based on their valuations. In this case, however, perfect envy-freeness may not be achievable given the discrete nature of items. Nonetheless, we should aim for a distribution that minimizes envy.

Let's analyze the best possible allocation:

1. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values this item very highly at 78, while Agent 1 values it at only 4. 
   - Therefore, it would be reasonable for Agent 0 to receive Item 1.

2. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values this item at 50, significantly more than Agent 0, who values it at 5.
   - Thus, Agent 1 should receive Item 2.

3. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values this item at 25, which is higher than Agent 0, who values it at 10.
   - However, considering an overall fair distribution, we need to balance the number of items. 
   - We will initially consider giving Item 0 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values this item at 54, which is substantially higher than Agent 1's valuation of 5.
   - Thus, Agent 0 should receive Item 3.

With this allocation, each agent receives 2 items:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2.

This allocation aims to provide a reasonably fair distribution based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
