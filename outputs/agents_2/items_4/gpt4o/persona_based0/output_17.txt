Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3
0  16  22  70  32
1  31  26  63  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations that each agent places on the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that, ideally, each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

The valuations given in the table are:

- Agent 0: Item 0 = 16, Item 1 = 22, Item 2 = 70, Item 3 = 32
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 31, Item 1 = 26, Item 2 = 63, Item 3 = 48

A possible approach is to maximize each agent's perceived value while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. We will try to balance the total value for each agent based on their individual valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (70)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (32)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (48)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (63)

To minimize potential envy, we can give each agent their highest valued item and then allocate the remaining items such that the total value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible.

**Allocation:**

1. Assign Item 2 (70) to Agent 0 because they value it the most.
2. Assign Item 3 (48) to Agent 1 because they value it the most.
3. Now, we have Item 0 and Item 1 left.
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 (22) more than Item 0 (16).
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 (31) more than Item 1 (26).

Therefore, we assign:
- Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0's total value: 70 (Item 2) + 22 (Item 1) = 92
- Agent 1's total value: 48 (Item 3) + 31 (Item 0) = 79

While not perfectly balanced, this distribution respects each agent's strongest preferences and minimizes envy by ensuring that each agent receives their most valued available item among the unallocated items.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
