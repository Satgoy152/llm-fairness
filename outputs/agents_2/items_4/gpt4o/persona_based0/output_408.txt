Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  80  87  77  38
1  11  17   7  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent feels they received a share of the items at least as valuable as any other agent's share, according to their own valuations.

Let's examine the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [80, 87, 77, 38]
- Agent 1's valuations: [11, 17, 7, 46]

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Identify the Highest Valued Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items in the order: Item 1 > Item 0 > Item 2 > Item 3
   - Agent 1 values items in the order: Item 3 > Item 1 > Item 0 > Item 2

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).

3. **Consider Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are Item 0 and Item 2.
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 highly, and it's the second most valuable for Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 moderately, but it's the least valuable for Agent 1.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (least valued by Agent 1, but there's no choice).

By this allocation, we try to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 0, with total valuation 87 + 80 = 167.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 2, with total valuation 46 + 7 = 53.

Agent 0's allocation is significantly higher in value, but given the constraints and existing valuations, this allocation minimizes perceived unfairness as much as possible while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.
