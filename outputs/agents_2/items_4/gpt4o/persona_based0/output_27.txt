Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3
0  27  64  25  22
1  84  35  93  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem ensuring envy-freeness for the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and allocate them in a way that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuation.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 27
  - Item 1: 64
  - Item 2: 25
  - Item 3: 22

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 93
  - Item 3: 64

A common approach in fair division is to use an algorithm like the Envy-Free algorithm, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. 

Let's consider the allocations:

1. **Agent 0's highest value item is Item 1 (64).**  
2. **Agent 1's highest value item is Item 2 (93).**

Assign the highest valued items to each agent first:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

Now, consider the remaining items:

- Remaining items are Item 0 and Item 3.
- Agent 0's next highest valuation among the remaining items is Item 0 (27).
- Agent 1's next highest valuation among the remaining items is Item 3 (64).

Assign the remaining items based on the highest remaining valuations:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation would look like:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 0
- Agent 1 receives items: 2, 3

This allocation considers the highest valuations and ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy.

The allocations in the requested JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
