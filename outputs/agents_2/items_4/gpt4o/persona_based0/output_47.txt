Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3
0  54  26  90  49
1  36  37  58  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items, aiming to minimize envy and ensure a fair division. The goal is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring that each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 54
- Item 1: 26
- Item 2: 90
- Item 3: 49

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 36
- Item 1: 37
- Item 2: 58
- Item 3: 42

To achieve a fair allocation, we can try to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 90. Assigning item 2 to agent 0 is a good choice since they value it significantly more than agent 1 does (58).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 37, which is higher than agent 0â€™s valuation of 26 for the same item. Assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Now, we are left with items 0 and 3. Agent 0 values item 0 more highly than agent 1 does (54 vs. 36), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
4. Finally, item 3 should go to agent 1 since it is the only item left, and agent 1 values it at 42, which is close to agent 0's valuation of 49.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 54 + 90 = 144.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3, with a total valuation of 37 + 42 = 79.

This allocation balances the valuations fairly between the agents, considering their preferences.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
