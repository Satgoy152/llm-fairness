Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3
0  72  56   5  96
1  30  73  70  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents such that envy-freeness is achieved, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. Envy-freeness means each agent should prefer or be indifferent to their own allocation over others' allocations.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 72
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 5
  - Item 3: 96

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 30
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 70
  - Item 3: 98

First, let's sum the total valuations for all items for each agent to see the overall distribution:

- Total value for Agent 0: 72 + 56 + 5 + 96 = 229
- Total value for Agent 1: 30 + 73 + 70 + 98 = 271

To achieve envy-freeness, we try to allocate items so that each agent perceives their allocation as equal or better than the allocation of the other agent.

### Allocation Strategy
1. Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest (96), and Agent 1 also values it highly (98). To balance this, let's give Item 3 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest after Item 3 (73), which is also highly valued by Agent 0 (56). We will assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values Item 0 second highest (72), which is less valuable for Agent 1 (30). Thus, we assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
4. Finally, we have Item 2, which Agent 1 values higher (70) compared to Agent 0 (5). Thus, we assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

### Proposed Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets: Item 0
- Agent 1 gets: Items 1, 2, 3

This allocation should be envy-free since:
- Agent 0 receives Item 0, which has the highest value for them compared to what they could get from the other items left after allocating Agent 1 their maximum preferences.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1, 2, and 3, which combined provide a high valuation that should leave them satisfied, since these are the other high-valued items for them.

### JSON Allocation Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
