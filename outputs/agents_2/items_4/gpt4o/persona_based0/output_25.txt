Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2  3
0  84  22  37  5
1   9  46  83  3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 22 37  5]
 [ 9 46 83  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that minimizes envy, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Below is the given valuation matrix:

```
       Items
      0   1   2   3
0 [ 84, 22, 37,  5]  <- Agent 0
1 [  9, 46, 83,  3]  <- Agent 1
```

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this item significantly higher (84 vs. 9). So, item 0 will be allocated to agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item higher (46 vs. 22). Thus, item 1 will be allocated to agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item higher (83 vs. 37). Therefore, item 2 will be allocated to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item slightly higher (5 vs. 3). So, item 3 will be allocated to agent 0.

This allocation aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while minimizing potential envy.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
