Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  78  40  31
1  90  29   7  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that they do not prefer the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 40
  - Item 3: 31

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 7
  - Item 3: 42

The goal is to allocate the items so that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocations respect as much as possible the preferences of each agent.

To minimize envy, we will try to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items. Let's consider some possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2; Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3:**
   - Agent 0's valuation: 78 (Item 1) + 40 (Item 2) = 118
   - Agent 1's valuation: 90 (Item 0) + 42 (Item 3) = 132

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 values their bundle at 118, and Agent 1 values their bundle at 132.
- This allocation aims to balance the valuations fairly considering the preferences.

Since we need to allocate all items, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
