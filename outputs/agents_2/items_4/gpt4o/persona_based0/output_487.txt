Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3
0  91   8  89  57
1  29  49  70  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we aim to create an allocation that is as close as possible to envy-free. In this scenario, an envy-free allocation would mean each agent feels they have received the most valuable set of items according to their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 8
  - Item 2: 89
  - Item 3: 57

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 29
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 70
  - Item 3: 85

To achieve a fair allocation, we will try to maximize the sum of perceived values for each agent and ensure that no agent envies the other's allocation.

### Possible Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items for Agent 0 are item 0 and item 2.
   - Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Remaining items are 1 and 3.
   - Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 1.

#### Resulting Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, which are their highest valued items.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3, which are not the highest individually, but combined provide a significant value for them.

This allocation minimizes envy because each agent receives items that maximize their own value given the constraints.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
