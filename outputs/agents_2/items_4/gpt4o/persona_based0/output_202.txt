Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  15  94  55
1  19  72   5  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to ensure that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation. A common approach is to maximize the total value of the items each agent receives, while also considering envy-freeness (i.e., no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own).

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 91, 15, 94, 55
Agent 1: 19, 72, 5, 32
```

Let's evaluate the distribution:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can assign items as follows:

- Assign item 0 and item 2 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for these items.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for this item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as this will minimize envy since Agent 0 has a relatively lower interest in item 3 compared to items 0 and 2.

This allocation is aimed at maximizing each agent's satisfaction and minimizing potential envy.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
