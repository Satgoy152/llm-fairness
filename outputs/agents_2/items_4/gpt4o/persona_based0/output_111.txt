Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3
0  19  78  37  65
1  65  14  80  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness (where no agent prefers the bundle of items that another agent receives over their own), we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item.

Here's the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  19  78  37  65
1  65  14  80  31
```

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for both agents:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (78).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (80).

2. **Allocate the highest-valued items:**
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Remaining items are 0 and 3.
   - Agent 0's next highest valuation is item 3 (65).
   - Agent 1's next highest valuation is item 0 (65).

4. **Finalize the allocation:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, aiming to minimize envy.

**Final allocations:**
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with no items left unallocated.
