Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  82  35  47
1  73  50  26  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of the other agent.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 4  
  - Item 1: 82  
  - Item 2: 35  
  - Item 3: 47  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 73  
  - Item 1: 50  
  - Item 2: 26  
  - Item 3: 50  

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should consider the possibility of maximizing each agent's satisfaction given their valuations. One approach is to allocate items in such a way that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible based on their respective valuations.

Let's test a possible allocation:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it significantly higher than Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it significantly higher than Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as it maximizes Agent 0's remaining value compared to Agent 1's lower valuation.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as it balances the remaining value and prevents any potential envy.

Thus, the allocation can be presented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2, with values of 82 and 35, totaling 117.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3, with values of 73 and 50, totaling 123.

This allocation is as balanced as possible given the constraints and should be envy-free, as each agent's total valuation of their own items is higher than or similar to the total valuation they would have for the other agent's items.
