Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  54   9  36  55
1  65  76  94  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation to the extent possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation received by any other agent, based on their own valuation.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 9
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 55

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 65
  - Item 1: 76
  - Item 2: 94
  - Item 3: 67

To minimize envy, it would be ideal to allocate items such that agents receive items with high personal value, while ensuring that no allocation seems significantly better from the perspective of the other agent.

A possible fair allocation strategy is:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it significantly more (65 vs. 54).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it much more (76 vs. 9).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for Agent 1 (94 vs. 36).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, since it has high value for both, but Agent 0 values it slightly more (55 vs. 67).

This allocation ensures that both agents get items they value highly. Agent 1 gets three items they value more, and Agent 0 gets one item they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
