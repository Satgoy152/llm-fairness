Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  79   1  42   0
1  30  74  50  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items between the two agents, we aim to follow the principle of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 79, Item 1 = 1, Item 2 = 42, Item 3 = 0.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 30, Item 1 = 74, Item 2 = 50, Item 3 = 39.

We need to allocate all four items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. One possible approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives according to their preference while ensuring no envy.

### Potential Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 0 (79) and Item 2 (42).
   - Allocating these items to Agent 0 would give them a total value of 121.
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 highly values Item 1 (74) and Item 3 (39).
   - Allocating these items to Agent 1 would give them a total value of 113.

This allocation respects each agent's preferences as closely as possible and ensures that no agent envies the other's allocation, given the total utility they receive.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
