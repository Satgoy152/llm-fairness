Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3
0  18   7  12  57
1  66  54  46  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free to the extent possible. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 18  
  - Item 1: 7  
  - Item 2: 12  
  - Item 3: 57  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 66  
  - Item 1: 54  
  - Item 2: 46  
  - Item 3: 56  

Let's allocate the items by maximizing each agent's perceived value and minimizing potential envy.

1. **Agent 0's highest preference** is for Item 3 (value 57).  
2. **Agent 1's highest preference** is for Item 0 (value 66).  

Assign these items to each respective agent first:

- Agent 0 gets Item 3.
- Agent 1 gets Item 0.

Now, we need to allocate Items 1 and 2:

- For **Item 1**:  
  - Agent 0 values it at 7.  
  - Agent 1 values it at 54.  

  Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as it holds significantly higher value for them.

- For **Item 2**:  
  - Agent 0 values it at 12.  
  - Agent 1 values it at 46.  

  Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it holds higher value for them compared to Agent 0.

This allocation considers the higher preferences of each agent, minimizing potential envy:

- Agent 0 receives Item 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0, 1, and 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
