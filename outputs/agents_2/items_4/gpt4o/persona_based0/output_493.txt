Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0  46  83  70  96
1  75  29   8  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve a division that considers the agents' valuations and ensures that neither agent envies the other's allocation more than their own. This problem is a classic example of a fair division problem with the constraint of providing integer allocations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 46
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 70
  - Item 3: 96

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 75
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 8
  - Item 3: 78

We will attempt to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy and provides a fair distribution of value, while each agent receives exactly two items. Here, a potential fair allocation could be based on maximizing the total value each agent receives according to their own valuation. 

Let's calculate the total value for each possible combination of item pairs:

- **Agent 0's preferences**:
  - Highest value items: 1 (83) and 3 (96)
  - Total value: 83 + 96 = 179

- **Agent 1's preferences**:
  - Highest value items: 0 (75) and 3 (78)
  - Total value: 75 + 78 = 153

We try to balance the allocations by taking preferences into account while ensuring no agent gets both of their highest-valued items:

One possible fair allocation is:
- Give Agent 0 items 0 and 2.
- Give Agent 1 items 1 and 3.

Verification:
- **Agent 0 receives**: Item 0 (46) and Item 2 (70)
  - Total value: 46 + 70 = 116

- **Agent 1 receives**: Item 1 (29) and Item 3 (78)
  - Total value: 29 + 78 = 107

This allocation ensures that both agents receive two items and the total values are close enough to reduce envy. 

Here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
