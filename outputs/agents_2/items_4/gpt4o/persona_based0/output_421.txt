Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3
0  55  77   6  28
1  46  60  61  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to divide the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Let's consider the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 55 + 77 + 6 + 28 = 166
- Agent 1's total valuation: 46 + 60 + 61 + 40 = 207

Now, let's analyze the relative valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 at 46.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 at 60.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 at 61.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 28, Agent 1 at 40.

A possible envy-free allocation would ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value. We will allocate items based on which agent values them more:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it more (55 vs 46).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it more (77 vs 60).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (61 vs 6).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it more (40 vs 28).

Allocating based on higher valuations for each item results in the following fair division:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
