Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  26  99  75
1  81  59  90   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's consider the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 44     | 26     | 99     | 75     |
| 1     | 81     | 59     | 90     | 3      |

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 (99) and item 3 (75) highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 (81) and item 2 (90) highly.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Since both agents highly value item 2 but agent 0 values it the most, it would be fair to allocate item 2 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 0, so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
   - Item 3 is valued more by agent 0 than agent 1, so allocate item 3 to agent 0.
   - Finally, item 1, which agent 1 values more than agent 0, should be allocated to agent 1.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation aims to balance the satisfaction of both agents considering their preferences.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
