Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3
0  98  66  55  86
1  57  42  87  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as good as the other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 55
  - Item 3: 86

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 42
  - Item 2: 87
  - Item 3: 63

To achieve a fair allocation, we can start by allocating the items based on the highest valuations of each agent, ensuring that the overall value perceived by each agent is balanced.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Initial Allocation by Highest Value**:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 since they value it highly at 98.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 since they value it highest at 87.

2. **Next Highest Values**:
   - After assigning Item 0 to Agent 0, their next highest valued item is Item 3 valued at 86.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Remaining Item**:
   - The remaining item is Item 1.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 as it is their next highest valued item after Item 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, thereby minimizing envy between the agents.

### Final Allocation

The final allocation can be presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, and Agent 1 receives items 2 and 1. Both agents receive two items each, and the allocation aims to respect each agent's preferences as closely as possible.
