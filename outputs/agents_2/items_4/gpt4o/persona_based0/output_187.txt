Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3
0  81  55  93  59
1   8  98  53   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness. The goal is to try to avoid envy, where possible, by ensuring each agent receives a set of items such that their total valuation is as equitable as possible.

Let's evaluate the valuations and consider potential allocations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 93
  - Item 3: 59

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 53
  - Item 3: 6

### Strategy for Allocation:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 1 has a high preference for this item (98), while Agent 0 values it at 55. Allocating this item to Agent 1 minimizes envy.

2. **Item 2**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (93), while Agent 1 values it at 53. Allocating this item to Agent 0 maximizes Agent 0's satisfaction.

3. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this at 81, which is significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation of 8. Allocate this to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this at 59, while Agent 1 values it at 6. Allocating this item to Agent 0 maximizes Agent 0's total valuation.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.

This allocation maximizes the total utility for each agent within the constraints and reduces the potential for envy.
