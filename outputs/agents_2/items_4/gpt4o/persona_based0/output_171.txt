Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  88  73  12
1  28  18  96   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider both the total value each agent places on their allocation and try to make the allocation as envy-free as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations. 

Here's a summary of the agents' valuations for each item:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 12

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 1

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should aim to allocate items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as highly as they would value the other agent's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 1 values Item 2 very highly (96),** so it makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0 places high values on Items 0 and 1 (73 and 88 respectively),** so one of these should be allocated to Agent 0.
3. **To balance the allocations and ensure each agent receives a fair share,** we can allocate Item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 places very low value on this item, making it easier for Agent 0 to accept the allocation without envy.
4. **Agent 0 receives Item 0 and Item 1,** maximizing their valuation and maintaining balance since Agent 1 places low value on both.

### Final Allocation

- **Agent 0:** Receives Items 0 and 1
- **Agent 1:** Receives Items 2 and 3

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they highly value, and the allocation is balanced given the constraints.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
