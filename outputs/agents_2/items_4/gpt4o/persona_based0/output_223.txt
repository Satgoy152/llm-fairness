Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  47  63   9
1  53   4  18  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 = 60, Item 1 = 47, Item 2 = 63, Item 3 = 9
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 = 53, Item 1 = 4, Item 2 = 18, Item 3 = 94

We aim to distribute the items in such a way that minimizes envy between the agents.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values Item 3 significantly higher than Agent 0 (94 vs. 9). Allocating Item 3 to Agent 1 minimizes potential envy.

2. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values Item 2 higher than Agent 1 (63 vs. 18). Allocating Item 2 to Agent 0 seems optimal.

3. **Item 0**: Both agents value Item 0 highly, but Agent 0 values it slightly higher (60 vs. 53). Allocating Item 0 to Agent 0 helps balance the valuations.

4. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values Item 1 significantly higher than Agent 1 (47 vs. 4). Allocating Item 1 to Agent 0 ensures Agent 0's allocation is perceived as valuable.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Item 3.

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value fairly between the agents while ensuring all items are allocated.
