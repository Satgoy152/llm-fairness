Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3
0  50  41  40  39
1   1  71  46  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we can apply a straightforward approach by ensuring that each agent receives the items they value the most. The goal is to minimize envy such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [50, 41, 40, 39]
- Agent 1: [1, 71, 46, 60]

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value 50).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the most (value 71).

2. **Allocate the next highest valued items:**
   - Agent 0's next highest valued items are 1, 2, and 3 with values 41, 40, and 39.
   - Agent 1's next highest valued items are 3 and 2 with values 60 and 46.

3. **Resolve remaining allocation:**
   - After assigning item 0 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1, we consider the remaining items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 3 (value 60) more than 2 (value 46), and Agent 0 values item 2 more than 3.
   - Thus, assign item 3 to Agent 1 and item 2 to Agent 0.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the distribution attempts to minimize envy based on the value each agent places on the items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
