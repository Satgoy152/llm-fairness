Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3
0   5  75   7  77
1  40  45  29  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here, we have two agents and four items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, ideally minimizing envy.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 5
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 7
  - Item 3: 77

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 29
  - Item 3: 54

To achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0: Agent 0 values this item highly (75), and Agent 1 has a relatively lower valuation (45).
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0: Agent 0 also values this item highly (77), and Agent 1 has a lower valuation (54).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1: While both agents have a relatively low valuation for this item, Agent 1 values it higher (40) than Agent 0 (5).
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1: Agent 1 values this item (29) more than Agent 0 (7).

This allocation aims to maximize the perceived value each agent receives based on their preferences, reducing the likelihood of envy.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
