Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0  71  66  29  99
1  82  12   8  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels they would be better off with the other's allocation.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [71, 66, 29, 99]
- Agent 1's valuations: [82, 12, 8, 76]

Given these valuations, we want to allocate the items to ensure each agent feels they receive a fair share.

### Step 1: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
- Agent 0's total valuation: 71 + 66 + 29 + 99 = 265
- Agent 1's total valuation: 82 + 12 + 8 + 76 = 178

### Step 2: Allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction.
One common approach is to allocate items based on which agent values them the most, ensuring no agent feels envious. However, since we are constrained by integer allocation and need to allocate all items, we must balance these considerations.

### Step 3: Consider initial allocations.
1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (82 vs. 71).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it more (66 vs. 12).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it more (29 vs. 8).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it more (99 vs. 76).

### Step 4: Ensure envy-freeness and adjust if necessary.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign Items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives a higher total valuation with their items and Agent 1 receives the item they value the most (Item 0).

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0 receives Items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.

This distribution should be considered fair and envy-free given the provided valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0]
}
```
