Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  93  52  21  74
1   7  88  91  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we want to aim for an envy-free distribution, where no agent would prefer the allocation of the other agent over their own. Let's evaluate the values assigned by each agent to each item:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 52
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 74

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 91
  - Item 3: 12

To achieve a fair distribution, we can consider the following:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 0 and 3.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for items 1 and 2.

Based on this, a fair allocation that minimizes envy could be:

- Assign items 0 and 3 to Agent 0, as these are highly valued by them.
- Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 1, as these are highly valued by them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value more highly, minimizing the likelihood of envy. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
