Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  21  59  60
1  63  20  80  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent believes they have received at least as much value as any other agent, given the items they have received.

Let's review the agents' valuations for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 60

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 80
  - Item 3: 12

A strategy for achieving a fair allocation can start by identifying items that have significantly higher valuations for one agent compared to the other.

1. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item at 80, whereas Agent 0 values it at 59. It makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 1 because Agent 1 has a stronger preference for it.
2. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item at 60, whereas Agent 1 values it at 12. Allocating this item to Agent 0 is fair as Agent 0 has a much stronger preference for this item.
3. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item at 63, whereas Agent 0 values it at 48. Allocating this item to Agent 1 makes sense since Agent 1 has a greater valuation for it.
4. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item at 21, whereas Agent 1 values it at 20. Allocating this item to Agent 0 is fair as Agent 0 has a slightly stronger preference.

With this allocation strategy, both agents receive two items each, and the allocation can be described as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation takes into account the preferences of both agents and attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent the items they value more highly relative to the other agent's valuation.
