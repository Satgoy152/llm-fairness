Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  79  90  15
1  15  96  64  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent receives an integer number of items, we aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuations for the items. A common approach is to use the Envy-Free algorithm or Max-Min allocation, but given the small size of the problem, we can manually determine a fair allocation.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [58, 79, 90, 15]
- Agent 1's valuations: [15, 96, 64, 17]

We'll aim to allocate the items such that both agents feel they are getting a fair share based on their valuations.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (90), and it’s one of the highest-valued items for Agent 0. Agent 1 also values it (64), but not as highly as other items. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the highest (96). This is a critical item for Agent 1, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 0**: After allocating items 1 and 2, Agent 0 still has significant value in item 0 (58), which is much higher than Agent 1’s valuation (15) for the same item. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: Finally, we have item 3 left. Agent 1 values it slightly more than Agent 0 (17 vs. 15). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value relatively highly, minimizing potential envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, with valuations 58 and 90, respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3, with valuations 96 and 17, respectively.

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and attempts to minimize envy, ensuring a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
