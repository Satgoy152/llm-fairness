Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  55  45  40
1  22  77  85  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring a distribution that minimizes envy, we can consider different allocation strategies. One approach is optimizing for maximum total utility while trying to distribute items in a way that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share relative to their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 58
   - Item 1: 55
   - Item 2: 45
   - Item 3: 40

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 22
   - Item 1: 77
   - Item 2: 85
   - Item 3: 45

Looking at the valuations, Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (85), whereas Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (58). To minimize envy, we can allocate the highest valued item of each agent to that agent.

Let's try the following allocation:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because it's their highest valued item.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because it's their highest valued item.
- Next, item 1 is highly valued by Agent 1 (77) much more than by Agent 0 (55), so it would be more efficient to allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- Finally, item 3 should be allocated to Agent 0 to balance the number of items (2 each).

Therefore, the allocation that minimizes envy and provides each agent with 2 items is:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures each agent has items with high personal valuations, minimizing the envy between agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
