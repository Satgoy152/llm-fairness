Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  10  92  23
1  84  92  21   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. In an envy-free allocation, each agent should feel that they received a bundle of items that is at least as valuable, according to their own valuations, as the bundle received by any other agent.

Let's evaluate the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 (91), Item 1 (10), Item 2 (92), Item 3 (23)
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 (84), Item 1 (92), Item 2 (21), Item 3 (6)

A potential allocation strategy is to maximize each agent's total valuation from their allocated items while ensuring that no agent envies the other.

We'll try to allocate the items to achieve this:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this the most (92), and Agent 1 doesn't value it as highly (21).
2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this the most (92), while Agent 0 values it less (10).
3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item highly (91), and it's the next most valuable item for both agents.
4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1:** This item has the least value for both agents, but it balances the number of items and is more valuable to Agent 0 (23) than to Agent 1 (6), but Agent 1 gets it since Agent 0 has already received two high-value items.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2, for a total valuation of 91 + 92 = 183.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 3, for a total valuation of 92 + 6 = 98.

Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
