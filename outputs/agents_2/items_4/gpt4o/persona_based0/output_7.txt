Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3
0  65  18  95  62
1  21  95  80  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation while ensuring no envy. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Valuations:**

   - Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
     - Item 0: 65
     - Item 1: 18
     - Item 2: 95
     - Item 3: 62

   - Agent 1 values the items as follows:
     - Item 0: 21
     - Item 1: 95
     - Item 2: 80
     - Item 3: 37

2. **Determine the Optimal Allocation:**

   The goal is to allocate the items such that the sum of valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible, thus ensuring no envy. A potential approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives.

3. **Allocate Items:**

   - **Item 2** has a high valuation for both agents, but Agent 0 values it the most. Therefore, allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - **Item 1** is highly valued by Agent 1, so assign it to Agent 1.
   - **Item 0** is more valuable to Agent 0 than Agent 1, so assign it to Agent 0.
   - **Item 3** has a higher value for Agent 0 than Agent 1. However, to ensure a fair distribution, we need to check the aggregate perceived values. After previous allocations, assign Item 3 to Agent 1 to balance the values.

4. **Calculate Total Valuation per Agent:**

   - Agent 0: Items [0, 2] → Total value = 65 + 95 = 160
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 3] → Total value = 95 + 37 = 132

This allocation gives Agent 0 a slightly higher total value, but it's a reasonable distribution given the high valuation differences and the goal of minimizing envy.

5. **Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
