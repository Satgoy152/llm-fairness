Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3
0  53  76  77  46
1  11  85  40  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In fair division problems like this, we aim to allocate items to agents in a manner that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items received by any other agent over their own bundle. However, given that we have two agents and four items, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible, but we will aim for a fair allocation.

First, let's summarize the valuation matrix for clarity:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   53   |   76   |   77   |   46   |
|   1   |   11   |   85   |   40   |   73   |

Now, let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Priority for Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (77), followed by Item 1 (76).
2. **Priority for Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 1 the highest (85), followed by Item 3 (73).

Given these priorities, let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 because it is their most valued item.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because it is their most valued item that is still available.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 because it is their next most valued item that is still available.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because it is their next most valued item that is still available.

Thus, the allocation would be:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2].
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 3].

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
