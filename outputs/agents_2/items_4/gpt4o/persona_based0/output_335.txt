Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3
0  24  56  47  45
1  32  86   9  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's first summarize the valuations from the table for clarity:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 45

- Agent 1's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 96

To find a fair allocation, let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items and try to allocate items such that the perceived value is balanced.

**Total Valuations:**
- Agent 0: 24 + 56 + 47 + 45 = 172
- Agent 1: 32 + 86 + 9 + 96 = 223

Given that agent 1 has higher total valuations, they have a stronger preference for certain items. However, our goal is to minimize envy and ensure a fair division.

**Allocation Strategy:**
1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because it has a very high value (86) for them.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since it also has a high value (96) for them.
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 as Agent 0 values it higher compared to Agent 1.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 as Agent 0 values it significantly higher compared to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives an equal number of items, and attempts to balance the perceived value from each agent's perspective.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives two items, and the distribution is done in a way that considers their preferences, reducing potential envy.
