Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3
0  39  72  63  99
1  43  37  61  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring an envy-free division, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation given to the other agent based on their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 39
- Item 1: 72
- Item 2: 63
- Item 3: 99

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 43
- Item 1: 37
- Item 2: 61
- Item 3: 25

To find a fair division, we should try to balance the total value each agent perceives in their allocation.

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (99), and agent 1 values item 0 the highest (43). A sensible approach is to give each agent their most valued item first.
2. Allocate item 3 to agent 0, as it is their highest-valued item.
3. Allocate item 0 to agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1 and 2) in a way that balances the perceived total valuation:

- Remaining items: 1 and 2
- Agent 0's valuation of these: 72 (item 1) and 63 (item 2)
- Agent 1's valuation of these: 37 (item 1) and 61 (item 2)

4. Allocate item 1 to agent 0 as it has a higher value for them (72) compared to agent 1 (37).
5. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 as it has a higher value for them (61) compared to agent 0 (63).

The final allocations are:

Agent 0 receives items 3 and 1: Total perceived value = 99 + 72 = 171
Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2: Total perceived value = 43 + 61 = 104

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value, minimizing envy.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
