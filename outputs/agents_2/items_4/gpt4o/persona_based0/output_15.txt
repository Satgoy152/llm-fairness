Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3
0  34  56   3  26
1  78   6  46  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to achieve a division that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent receives a set of items they value. The goal is to find an allocation where each agent feels that their share is at least as good as the other shares based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [34, 56, 3, 26]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [78, 6, 46, 12]

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value is for item 1: 56
   - Second highest is item 0: 34

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value is for item 0: 78
   - Second highest is item 2: 46

We can attempt a fair division by allocating items based on these preferences, ensuring both agents feel satisfied with their allocation compared to the other agent's share.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value = 56 for Agent 0)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value = 78 for Agent 1)

Now we are left with items 2 and 3:

- Agent 0 values item 3 (26) higher than item 2 (3)
- Agent 1 values item 2 (46) higher than item 3 (12)

Assign item 3 to Agent 0 and item 2 to Agent 1. This respects the second preferences of each agent.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3: Total value = 56 + 26 = 82
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2: Total value = 78 + 46 = 124

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives and minimizes envy, as each agent values their allocation highly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
