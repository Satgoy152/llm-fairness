Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3
0  82  94  26  35
1  82  48  92  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we first need to consider their valuations for each item. The goal is to ensure that neither agent feels that the other has been given a better set of items based on their own valuations. The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0's valuations: [82, 94, 26, 35]
- Agent 1's valuations: [82, 48, 92, 32]

One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to try to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. Let's evaluate some possible allocations:

1. **Allocating item 1 to Agent 0 and the rest to Agent 1:**

   - Agent 0: Item 1 (94)
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 2, and 3 (82 + 92 + 32 = 206)

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 94
   - Agent 1: 206

   This allocation is not envy-free as Agent 0 is likely to be envious of Agent 1.

2. **Allocating item 2 to Agent 1 and the rest to Agent 0:**

   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 3 (82 + 94 + 35 = 211)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (92)

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 211
   - Agent 1: 92

   This allocation is also not envy-free as Agent 1 is likely to be envious of Agent 0.

3. **Balanced approach:**

   Let's try a more balanced approach:

   - Agent 0: Items 0 and 3 (82 + 35 = 117)
   - Agent 1: Items 1 and 2 (48 + 92 = 140)

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 117
   - Agent 1: 140

   This allocation is closer to being fair, but Agent 0 might still be somewhat envious.

4. **Another possible balanced approach:**

   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 2 (94 + 26 = 120)
   - Agent 1: Items 0 and 3 (82 + 32 = 114)

   Valuations:
   - Agent 0: 120
   - Agent 1: 114

   In this allocation, both agents have similar valuations, which minimizes envy.

Given these considerations, the allocation that minimizes envy and is closer to an envy-free distribution is the last one.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
