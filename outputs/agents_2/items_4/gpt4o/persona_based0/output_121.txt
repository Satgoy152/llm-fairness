Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3
0  76   0  28  93
1  51  54  67  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuation.

Let's evaluate each allocation option:

1. Agent 0's valuations: [76, 0, 28, 93]
2. Agent 1's valuations: [51, 54, 67, 33]

We will aim to allocate the items so that each agent receives the highest possible value from their perspective without causing envy.

**Allocation Strategy:**

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it the most (93).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it the most (67).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as the next highest value for them is 76.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it more (54) than Agent 0 (0).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3, with total value = 76 + 93 = 169
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2, with total value = 54 + 67 = 121

Both agents receive items they highly value, which should reduce envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
