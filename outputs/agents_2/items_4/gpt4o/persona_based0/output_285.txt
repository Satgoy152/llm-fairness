Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  28  59  91
1  85  50  88  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent gets at least one item. Here's the breakdown of each agent's preferences:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 28
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 91

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 85
  - Item 1: 50
  - Item 2: 88
  - Item 3: 72

To achieve an envy-free or equitable allocation, we can consider the following strategy:

1. Agent 1 highly values Item 2 (88) and Item 0 (85). Therefore, it would be beneficial for Agent 1 to receive these items.
2. Agent 0 values Item 3 (91) the most, followed by Item 2 (59). However, since Item 2 is more valuable to Agent 1, assigning Item 3 to Agent 0 would make sense.
3. This leaves Items 1 and 3 to be distributed. Since Agent 0 values Item 3 (91) highly, it is reasonable to allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
4. The remaining Item 1 could go to Agent 0 as well, as Agent 1 values it less compared to the other items they received.

Given this analysis, here is a suitable allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 and 2

This allocation attempts to respect the highest valuations of each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
