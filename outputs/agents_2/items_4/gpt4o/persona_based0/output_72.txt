Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  88   6  58
1  73  58  35  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider their valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. This means each agent should feel they have received a fair share based on their valuation of the items they received compared to the items they did not receive.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 90  
  - Item 1: 88  
  - Item 2: 6  
  - Item 3: 58  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 73  
  - Item 1: 58  
  - Item 2: 35  
  - Item 3: 33  

One possible way to allocate the items fairly while considering the valuations is:

1. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest (90), and Agent 1 also values it relatively high (73), but Agent 0's preference is stronger.

2. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 88, which is significant compared to Agent 1's valuation of 58.

3. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1:**  
   - Although Agent 0 has a low valuation (6) for Item 2, Agent 1 values it at 35, making it more valuable for Agent 1.

4. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 58, and Agent 1 values it at 33. However, since Agent 0 already has two high-value items, assigning this to Agent 1 balances the allocation.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 2 and 3.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
