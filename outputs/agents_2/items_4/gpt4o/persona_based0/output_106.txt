Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1  2   3
0  18   5  7  36
1  63  40  2   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents such that envy-freeness is maintained, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to assign the items so that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Here are the valuations given:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 (18), Item 1 (5), Item 2 (7), Item 3 (36)
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 (63), Item 1 (40), Item 2 (2), Item 3 (5)

To start, let's consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction by calculating their preferences:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Most valuable item: Item 3 (36)
   - Second most valuable item: Item 0 (18)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Most valuable item: Item 0 (63)
   - Second most valuable item: Item 1 (40)

It's clear that Agent 1 values Item 0 the most, whereas Agent 0 values Item 3 the most. We should try to allocate these most-preferred items to each agent first to maximize satisfaction. Let's proceed with this plan:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (since 63 > 18)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (since 36 > 5)

Next, we look at the remaining items (Item 1 and Item 2):

- **Remaining items**:
  - Agent 0's next available choice is Item 0 (18) and Item 1 (5)
  - Agent 1's next available choice is Item 1 (40) and Item 2 (2)

Considering what's left:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (40 > 5)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (7 > 2)

Now, each agent has two items, and the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1

This allocation is envy-free because each agent receives their more preferred items based on available choices, and no agent values another agent's allocation more than their own.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
