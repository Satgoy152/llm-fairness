Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  27   4  74
1  20  86  60  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents (0 and 1) while considering their valuations, we aim to satisfy the criteria of envy-freeness as much as possible given the integer constraint on the number of items each agent can receive. 

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 61
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 74

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 20
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 60
  - Item 3: 60

To achieve a fair division, we need to allocate all 4 items such that the allocations try to minimize envy between the agents.

### Possible Allocation Strategy

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 61, Agent 1 values it at 20. 
   - Assign to Agent 0, as they value it higher.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 27, Agent 1 values it at 86.
   - Assign to Agent 1, as they value it significantly higher.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 values it at 60.
   - Assign to Agent 1, as they value it much higher.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 values it at 60.
   - Assign to Agent 0, as they value it higher.

Therefore, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.

This allocation seeks to balance the total valuations each agent receives, reducing the potential for envy.

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
