Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0  10   6  32  22
1  13  13  99  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 10, Item 1 at 6, Item 2 at 32, Item 3 at 22.
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 13, Item 1 at 13, Item 2 at 99, Item 3 at 37.

To achieve fairness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction (also known as the max-min fairness criterion). Let's allocate the items in a way that balances total value for each agent as evenly as possible:

1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 2 (99), which is significantly larger than any other item's valuation for both agents. Allocating Item 2 to Agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction and minimizes potential envy.

2. For the remaining items (0, 1, and 3), we will balance the allocations:
   - Item 3 is valued higher by Agent 1 (37) compared to Agent 0 (22), but to balance satisfaction after allocating Item 2 to Agent 1, we allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Item 0 is valued at 10 by Agent 0 and 13 by Agent 1. We allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 to balance the distribution.
   - Item 1 is valued at 6 by Agent 0 and 13 by Agent 1. We allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

The allocation can be summarized as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuations received by each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
