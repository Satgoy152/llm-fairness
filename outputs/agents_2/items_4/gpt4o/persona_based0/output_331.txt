Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  27  58  74
1  42  73  36  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to find an allocation that is envy-free or as fair as possible. The goal is to assign each agent a subset of items such that each agent values their own allocation as much as or more than any other allocation, achieving envy-freeness if possible. Here is one approach to achieve such fairness:

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 26
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 74

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 42
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 10

### Total Valuation for Each Agent:
- **Agent 0**: 26 + 27 + 58 + 74 = 185
- **Agent 1**: 42 + 73 + 36 + 10 = 161

### Allocation Strategy:
- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (74), and Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (73). 
- To achieve fairness, we can allocate the highest-valued items to each agent to balance the total utility.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Assign items [2, 3].
  - Total value for Agent 0: 58 + 74 = 132

- **Agent 1**: Assign items [0, 1].
  - Total value for Agent 1: 42 + 73 = 115

This allocation considers each agent's highest values and tries to balance the total valuations, aiming for perceived fairness, though it may not be perfectly envy-free.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
