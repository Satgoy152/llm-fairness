Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  63  89  73  99
1  56  23  22  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to create an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness denotes a situation where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 63
- Item 1: 89
- Item 2: 73
- Item 3: 99

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 56
- Item 1: 23
- Item 2: 22
- Item 3: 36

We can attempt to allocate items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuation.

One potential approach is to allocate based on maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we might achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 99.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 56.

2. **Allocate the highest valued item to each agent**:
   - Give item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Give item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining items to balance the value**:
   - Agent 0 receives item 1, which they value at 89.
   - Agent 1 receives item 2, which they value at 22.

Now, let's check the total valuation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3, with total value: 89 + 99 = 188.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2, with total value: 56 + 22 = 78.

Although the total values are not equal, this allocation minimizes envy, as each agent receives at least one of their higher-valued items, and no other configuration offers a more balanced outcome given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
