Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0  37  46  68  43
1  87  32   6  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we aim to minimize envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over the allocation of any other agent.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 37
  - Item 1 at 46
  - Item 2 at 68
  - Item 3 at 43

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 87
  - Item 1 at 32
  - Item 2 at 6
  - Item 3 at 53

To achieve envy-freeness, we can try to allocate items such that each agent receives the items they value most relative to the other agent's valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**:  
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 87, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 37.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 46, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 32.

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 68, which is significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation of 6.

4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**:  
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 at 53, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 43.

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's preference for their own bundle compared to the other agent's bundle. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent two items, and it attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent items they value highly compared to the other agent's valuations.
