Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3
0  32   3  70  55
1  88  41   1  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility each agent derives from their allocated items. This involves considering the total value each agent assigns to their allocated items and trying to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's calculate the total values each agent would receive under several possible allocations, aiming to make the allocations as envy-free as possible:

1. **Allocation Option 1:**
    - Agent 0: Gets items 0 and 3
      - Total value: 32 (item 0) + 55 (item 3) = 87
    - Agent 1: Gets items 1 and 2
      - Total value: 41 (item 1) + 1 (item 2) = 42

2. **Allocation Option 2:**
    - Agent 0: Gets items 2 and 3
      - Total value: 70 (item 2) + 55 (item 3) = 125
    - Agent 1: Gets items 0 and 1
      - Total value: 88 (item 0) + 41 (item 1) = 129

3. **Allocation Option 3:**
    - Agent 0: Gets items 0 and 2
      - Total value: 32 (item 0) + 70 (item 2) = 102
    - Agent 1: Gets items 1 and 3
      - Total value: 41 (item 1) + 62 (item 3) = 103

Let's consider Allocation Option 3, which appears to balance the total valuations more closely and reduces potential envy:

- Agent 0 receives items with a total valuation of 102.
- Agent 1 receives items with a total valuation of 103.

This allocation closely balances the agents' satisfaction, as both agents receive a high total value from their items, and the difference in totals is minimal. Therefore, this allocation is likely to be perceived as fair and minimizes envy.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
