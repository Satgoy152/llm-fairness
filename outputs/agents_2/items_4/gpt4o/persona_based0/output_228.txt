Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3
0  43  34  56  26
1  32  88  18  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, a common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is considered envy-free if each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [43, 34, 56, 26]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [32, 88, 18, 43]

Since there are 4 items, each agent can receive 2 items. We will aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring the allocation is as fair as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest valued items are item 2 (56) and item 0 (43).
   - Agent 1's highest valued items are item 1 (88) and item 3 (43).

2. **Consider allocations to balance the fairness:**
   - Give Agent 0 their highest valued items: item 2 (56) and item 0 (43). This gives them a total value of 99.
   - Give Agent 1 their highest valued items: item 1 (88) and item 3 (43). This gives them a total value of 131.

3. **Check for envy-freeness:**
   - Agent 0 values their own allocation (items 2 and 0) as 56 + 43 = 99.
   - Agent 0 values Agent 1's allocation (items 1 and 3) as 34 + 26 = 60.
   - Agent 1 values their own allocation (items 1 and 3) as 88 + 43 = 131.
   - Agent 1 values Agent 0's allocation (items 2 and 0) as 18 + 32 = 50.

Neither agent envies the other as each agent values their own allocation more than the other's. Thus, the allocation is envy-free.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
