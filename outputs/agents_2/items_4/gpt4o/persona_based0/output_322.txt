Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3
0   9  74  59  95
1  59  93  67  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, our goal is to minimize envy and ensure each agent gets items that maximize their valuation, considering the constraints of the problem.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 95

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 93
  - Item 2: 67
  - Item 3: 57

A simple and effective approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation of each item if possible, while balancing the total value of allocations to minimize envy.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it more (59 vs. 9).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it more (93 vs. 74).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it more (67 vs. 59).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it more (95 vs. 57).

Now, let's try to balance the allocations by value:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (most valued by Agent 0)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (most valued by Agent 1)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0)

This allocation results in:

- Total value for Agent 0: 59 (Item 2) + 95 (Item 3) = 154
- Total value for Agent 1: 59 (Item 0) + 93 (Item 1) = 152

This allocation is fairly balanced in terms of valuation and should minimize envy.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
