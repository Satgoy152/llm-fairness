Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3
0  48   5  31  99
1  84  22  64  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to achieve a fair division in terms of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the distribution is envy-free, if possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 5
  - Item 2: 31
  - Item 3: 99

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 22
  - Item 2: 64
  - Item 3: 95

To achieve a fair allocation, we want to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent and try to minimize envy. A common approach is to use a method like the "envy-free" allocation if possible or otherwise prioritize maximizing individual utilities.

Let's try a simple allocation based on maximizing individual preferences:

1. **Allocate Item 3**: This item has the highest valuation for both agents, but Agent 0 values it slightly higher than Agent 1 (99 vs. 95). Allocate it to Agent 0.

2. **Allocate Item 0**: This item is highly valued by both agents, but Agent 1 values it more (84 vs. 48). Allocate it to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Item 2**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation for this item (64 vs. 31). Allocate it to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate Item 1**: This item has low valuations for both agents, but it's the remaining item. Allocate it to Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation attempts to maximize the value each agent receives while maintaining a balance between the agents' preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
