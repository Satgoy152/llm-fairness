Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  21  60  67
1   7  46  35  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among agents 0 and 1, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This typically means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over that of the other, given their valuations.

The valuations of the agents for the items are as follows:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 60
  - Item 3: 67

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 35
  - Item 3: 63

Let's consider a potential allocation that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while trying to minimize envy. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest relative value an agent places on each item compared to the other agent. 

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 89 while Agent 1 values it at 7. 
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 21 while Agent 1 values it at 46. 
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 60 while Agent 1 values it at 35. 
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 67 while Agent 1 values it at 63. 
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives us the following total valuations:

- **Agent 0**: 89 (Item 0) + 60 (Item 2) = 149
- **Agent 1**: 46 (Item 1) + 63 (Item 3) = 109

This allocation ensures that each agent values their set of items more than the other agent's set, achieving an envy-free distribution.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
