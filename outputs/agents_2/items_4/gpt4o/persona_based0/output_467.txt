Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

   0   1   2   3
0  5  83   0  60
1  2  76  61  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to allocate the items to the agents in a way that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 5, 83, 0, 60
- Agent 1 values: 2, 76, 61, 31

We will attempt to assign items to agents so that the total value of items received by each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 83, and Agent 1 values it at 76. 
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more.

2. **Allocate Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 0, and Agent 1 values it at 61.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it more.

3. **Allocate Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 60, and Agent 1 values it at 31.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more.

4. **Allocate Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 5, and Agent 1 values it at 2.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives Items 1, 3, and 0.
- Agent 1 receives Item 2.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2]
}
```
