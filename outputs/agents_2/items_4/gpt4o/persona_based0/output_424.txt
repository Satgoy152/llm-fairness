Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3
0  62  53  47  80
1  86  31   0  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness as a guiding principle. Envy-freeness ensures that each agent prefers their own allocation over the other agent's allocation based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: Items [62, 53, 47, 80]
Agent 1: Items [86, 31,  0, 95]
```

We can calculate the total value each agent can achieve from different allocations and try to minimize envy. Here is a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 62
   - Item 1: 53
   - Item 2: 47
   - Item 3: 80

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 86
   - Item 1: 31
   - Item 2:  0
   - Item 3: 95

A sensible allocation strategy is to assign items so that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while minimizing the other agent's envy. 

Let's allocate:

- Give **Item 0** to **Agent 1** because it has the highest value for Agent 1, and Agent 0 does not have as high a preference for it.
- Give **Item 3** to **Agent 0** because it is the highest value for Agent 0.
- Give **Item 1** to **Agent 0** because it is the second highest value for Agent 0 and not as important for Agent 1.
- Give **Item 2** to **Agent 1** as it is the least valued item for both agents and completes the allocation.

This allocation leads to:

- Total value for Agent 0: 53 + 80 = 133
- Total value for Agent 1: 86 + 0 = 86

In this allocation, both agents receive items they value highly, and it minimizes the potential for envy.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and both agents receive an integer number of items, satisfying the conditions of the problem.
