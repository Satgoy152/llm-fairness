Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  62   8  30   5
1   0  26  10  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find an envy-free allocation of items between the two agents, we can follow a simple fair division method. One strategy is to maximize each agent's total utility while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation. 

First, let's sum up each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(62 + 8 + 30 + 5 = 105\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(0 + 26 + 10 + 80 = 116\)

Now, let's allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's share based on their individual valuations while trying to minimize envy:

1. **Assign item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most (62 vs. 0), so assign item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Assign item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 the most (80 vs. 5), so assign item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Assign item 1**: Agent 1 has a higher valuation for item 1 (26 vs. 8), so assign item 1 to agent 1.

4. **Assign item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 higher (30 vs. 10), so assign item 2 to agent 0.

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of \(62 + 30 = 92\).
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3, with a total valuation of \(26 + 80 = 106\).

Under this allocation, each agent receives items that maximize their utility based on their valuations without causing envy given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
