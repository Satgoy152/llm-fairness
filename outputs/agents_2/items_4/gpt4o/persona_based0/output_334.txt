Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3
0  92  69   8  47
1   3  33  14  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 33 14 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve a division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that they received items worth at least as much as any other agent's bundle according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0:
Item 0: 92
Item 1: 69
Item 2: 8
Item 3: 47

Agent 1:
Item 0: 3
Item 1: 33
Item 2: 14
Item 3: 14
```

One possible way to allocate the items is to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. This can be done by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 92, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 relatively high at 33, so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- For the remaining items, item 3 is valued higher by both agents than item 2. Therefore, we allocate item 3 to agent 0, who values it more (47 compared to agent 1's 14).
- Finally, item 2 is allocated to agent 1, as it's the only remaining item.

Checking the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, with values 92 and 47, respectively.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, with values 33 and 14, respectively.

Both agents have received a bundle that they value, and with this allocation, no agent envies the other's allocation given their respective valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
