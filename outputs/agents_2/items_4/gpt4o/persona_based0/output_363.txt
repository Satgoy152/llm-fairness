Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3
0   0   9  93   0
1  47  48  46  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. A common goal is to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [0, 9, 93, 0]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [47, 48, 46, 35]

We need to allocate all 4 items (0, 1, 2, 3) between the two agents to maximize fairness. Let's examine a potential allocation:

**Allocation Proposal:**

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 because it is highly valued by Agent 0 (value of 93), while Agent 1 values it at 46.
- Assign items 0, 1, and 3 to Agent 1. Agent 1 values these items at [47, 48, 35] respectively, and the total valuation for these items by Agent 1 is 130.

**Valuations for this allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives item [2], total value = 93
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1, 3], total value = 130

Both agents receive bundles that are valuable to them, and since these valuations are based on their subjective preferences, this allocation can be considered envy-free. Agent 0 would not prefer the bundle of Agent 1 since their most valued item (item 2) is in their own bundle, while Agent 1's allocation includes items they value highly.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
