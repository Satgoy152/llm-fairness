Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3
0  29   9  95  36
1  66  42  52  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 42 52 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. In simpler terms, we want to ensure that both agents feel they are getting a fair deal based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0: [29, 9, 95, 36]
- Agent 1: [66, 42, 52, 60]

**Step 1: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**

Total valuation for Agent 0 = 29 + 9 + 95 + 36 = 169  
Total valuation for Agent 1 = 66 + 42 + 52 + 60 = 220

**Step 2: Determine a Fair Allocation**

To allocate the items fairly, we attempt to ensure that the allocation results in each agent receiving a set of items such that neither agent envies the other.

Let's test allocations that equitably distribute the perceived value:

**Allocation:**

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
- Assign items 0, 1, 3 to Agent 1 (balancing the remaining values)

**Agent 0's allocation:**

- Value of item 2 for Agent 0 = 95

**Agent 1's allocation:**

- Value of item 0 for Agent 1 = 66
- Value of item 1 for Agent 1 = 42
- Value of item 3 for Agent 1 = 60
- Total value for Agent 1 = 66 + 42 + 60 = 168

**Result:**

- Agent 0 receives an item with a total value of 95.
- Agent 1 receives items with a total value of 168.

Agent 0's total value of 95 is less than Agent 1's total of 168, but considering Agent 0's highest value item (2) is included in their allocation, this should maintain a fair perception.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items in a way that reflects their valuations as fairly as possible.
