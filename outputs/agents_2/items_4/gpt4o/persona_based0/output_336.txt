Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  13  81  56
1  19  75  63  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- **Agent 0's valuations**: 
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 3: 56

- **Agent 1's valuations**:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 63
  - Item 3: 10

We can use the following approach to allocate the items:

1. **Item 2** is most valued by Agent 0 (81) and also highly valued by Agent 1 (63). But since Agent 0 values it significantly more, giving it to Agent 0 might reduce potential envy.

2. **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 1 (75), so it should be allocated to Agent 1.

3. **Item 0** is valued higher by Agent 1 (19) compared to Agent 0 (8), so it should be allocated to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3** is valued higher by Agent 0 (56) compared to Agent 1 (10), so it should be allocated to Agent 0.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent the items they value more highly than the other agent. Following this logic, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
