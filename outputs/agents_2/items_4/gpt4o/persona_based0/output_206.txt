Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3
0  98  92  47  39
1  86  36  77  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. Here's the breakdown of the valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 0's valuations:**
  - Item 0: 98
  - Item 1: 92
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 39

- **Agent 1's valuations:**
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 77
  - Item 3: 28

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations, minimizing envy. One possible approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation from the items they receive. 

Let's consider the total valuation each agent can potentially achieve from different allocations:

1. **Allocation with focus on maximizing valuations:**
   - Agent 0 gets items that give them the highest total valuation possible.
   - Agent 1 gets the remaining items, which should also maximize their total valuation from the remaining choices.

We proceed as follows:

- **Agent 0** values Item 0 (98) and Item 1 (92) highly. Allocating these to Agent 0 gives them a total valuation of 190.
- **Agent 1** can then receive Item 2 (77) and Item 3 (28), with a total valuation of 105.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for both agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Both agents receive items with the highest possible valuation for themselves given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3, optimizing their total value from the remaining items.
