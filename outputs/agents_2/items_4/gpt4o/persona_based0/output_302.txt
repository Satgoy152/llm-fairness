Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0  1   2   3
0  18  5  96  12
1  94  6  24  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94  6 24 60]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve a division that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy. We'll use the valuations provided to identify an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, or at least equitable.

### Valuations:
- Agent 0 values: [18, 5, 96, 12]
- Agent 1 values: [94, 6, 24, 60]

### Total Valuation:
To understand the significance of each item, we sum the valuations of each item across agents:
- Item 0: 18 (Agent 0) + 94 (Agent 1) = 112
- Item 1: 5 (Agent 0) + 6 (Agent 1) = 11
- Item 2: 96 (Agent 0) + 24 (Agent 1) = 120
- Item 3: 12 (Agent 0) + 60 (Agent 1) = 72

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Assign high-value items to agents who value them significantly more**:
   - Item 0 should go to Agent 1 (since 94 > 18).
   - Item 2 should go to Agent 0 (since 96 > 24).

2. **Assign remaining items while considering the next highest preferences**:
   - Item 1 is low-valued by both, but slightly more by Agent 1 (6 > 5).
   - Item 3 has a higher valuation for Agent 1 (60 > 12).

Given these observations and aiming for envy-free or as close to it, here's a reasonable allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 1, 3]

This allocation gives each agent some of their high-value preferences and attempts to balance the distribution of items based on their valuations.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
