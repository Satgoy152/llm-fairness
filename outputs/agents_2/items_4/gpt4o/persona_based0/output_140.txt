Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0   5   5  92  82
1  93  56  76  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they received a fair share without envying the other's allocation. 

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [5, 5, 92, 82]
- Agent 1: [93, 56, 76, 89]

One potential allocation could be determined by ensuring each agent gets the items they value most. Let's evaluate the highest value items for each agent and allocate accordingly:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the most (92) and item 3 second most (82).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (93) and item 3 second most (89).

However, since item 3 is highly valued by both, we must consider a trade-off. Let's allocate items to maximize the satisfaction for each agent:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valuation.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their second-highest valuation and prevents Agent 0 from having both of their top items.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valuation.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it has equal value for Agent 0 and is available.

After this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 1, with a total valuation of 92 + 5 = 97.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 0, with a total valuation of 89 + 93 = 182.

This allocation respects the interests of both agents and ensures a fair division based on their valuations. The items are allocated without any agent feeling significantly disadvantaged given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 0]
}
```
