Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1  2   3
0  45  17  3  32
1  89  24  0  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents in a way that is envy-free, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 45, Item 1 = 17, Item 2 = 3, Item 3 = 32
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 89, Item 1 = 24, Item 2 = 0, Item 3 = 22

We need to allocate all items such that the allocations are envy-free. A common approach is to maximize each agent's valuation based on their preferences. 

1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 0, with a value of 89. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Next, Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for Item 3, with a value of 32. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
3. For the remaining items (Item 1 and Item 2), Agent 1 has a higher valuation for Item 1 (24) compared to Agent 0 (17). Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
4. Finally, Item 2 is left. Agent 0 has a valuation of 3 for Item 2, while Agent 1 has a valuation of 0. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, minimizing envy.

Allocations:

{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
