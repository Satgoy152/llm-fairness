Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  18  18  97
1  97  88   2  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 88  2 16]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we will aim for envy-freeness, where each agent should not prefer the bundle of items assigned to the other agent over their own, based on their valuations.

### Valuations Matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3
0  85  18  18  97
1  97  88   2  16
```

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (value 97).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (value 97).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High-Value Items:**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items left unallocated are 1 and 2.

4. **Allocation of Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0 values both items 1 and 2 equally (value 18 each).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 much higher (value 88) than item 2 (value 2).

5. **Allocate Based on Remaining Preferences:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because it has a high value for them.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it is of equal value to them as item 1, and item 1 is already allocated to Agent 1.

### Allocation Result:

Agent 0 receives items 3 and 2.  
Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives items that maximize their utility based on their valuations, and both have a share they prefer or are indifferent to the other's share.
