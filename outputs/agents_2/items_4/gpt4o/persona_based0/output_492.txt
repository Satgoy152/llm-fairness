Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  86   8  62
1  70  21  79  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents, we can aim for an envy-free distribution as much as possible. This means that each agent should value their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation given to the other agent. Given the valuations, we want to distribute the items to maximize fairness.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 8
  - Item 3: 62

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 79
  - Item 3: 94

To find a fair distribution, let's consider the total valuations each agent has over all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 89 + 86 + 8 + 62 = 245
- Total value for Agent 1: 70 + 21 + 79 + 94 = 264

Given these valuations, we can try to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share, while also trying to minimize envy.

After evaluating different allocations, one possible fair allocation is:

- Allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate items 2 and 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: 89 (item 0) + 86 (item 1) = 175
- Agent 1: 79 (item 2) + 94 (item 3) = 173

Both agents receive allocations that they value highly, and neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their own valuations.

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
