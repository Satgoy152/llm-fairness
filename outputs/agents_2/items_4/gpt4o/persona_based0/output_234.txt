Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  12  99  16  70
1  49   0  47  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents in such a way that minimizes envy. Envy occurs when an agent values the items allocated to another agent more than the items allocated to themselves. We need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 12, Item 1 = 99, Item 2 = 16, Item 3 = 70.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 49, Item 1 = 0, Item 2 = 47, Item 3 = 34.

We aim to allocate the items such that no agent envies the other's allocation. We can use a simple approach to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:** This item has the highest value for Agent 0 (99), and Agent 1 values it at 0, so giving it to Agent 0 will not cause envy for Agent 1.
   
2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1:** This item has a higher value for Agent 1 (49) compared to Agent 0 (12).

3. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0:** This item has a value of 70 for Agent 0 and 34 for Agent 1. Allocating it to Agent 0 is favorable because it maintains high value for Agent 0 without causing much envy in Agent 1.

4. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:** This item has a value of 47 for Agent 1 and 16 for Agent 0, making it a preferable allocation to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items and that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
