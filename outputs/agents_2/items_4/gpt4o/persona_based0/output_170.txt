Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  54  63  82
1  59  16   0  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [59 16  0 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim for an allocation that is envy-free, meaning that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the other agent's allocation. We will examine the valuations and try to allocate the items to achieve this.

### Valuations
- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 54
  - Item 2: 63
  - Item 3: 82

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 0
  - Item 3: 90

### Analysis
1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values this highest at 90, while Agent 1 values it at 59. Assigning this to Agent 0 aligns with maximizing their valuation.
  
2. **Item 3**: Both agents value this item highly, with Agent 1 valuing it at 90 and Agent 0 at 82. To balance the allocation, assign this item to Agent 1.
  
3. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 54, and Agent 1 at 16. Assign this item to Agent 0, as it is more valuable to them.

4. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 63, and Agent 1 at 0. Assign this to Agent 0, as Agent 1 has no value for it.

### Proposed Allocation
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.

This allocation aims to be envy-free based on the given valuations, as each agent receives items they value highly relative to the other agent's allocation.

### Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3]
}
```
