Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  11  51  51
1  92  48  85  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address the problem of fairly allocating the items to the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuations while keeping allocations envy-free to the extent possible given the discrete nature of the problem.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 49     | 11     | 51     | 51     |
| 1     | 92     | 48     | 85     | 91     |

We should aim to allocate items to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring no agent feels another agent received more value than they did, which is the premise of envy-freeness. However, with only 4 items and 2 agents, achieving strict envy-freeness might not be possible, but we can aim to minimize envy.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 1** has very high valuations for all items, especially item 0, compared to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 0** has relatively balanced valuations but values item 2 and item 3 equally and the most compared to other items.

A straightforward allocation could be:
- Assign items that maximize each agent's utility while trying to balance the total value each receives.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (92) and Item 3 (91). Total value: 183.
- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (11) and Item 2 (51). Total value: 62.

This allocation gives Agent 1 a higher total value, but it reflects the higher valuations they have for items. It's challenging to perfectly balance the envy due to the discrete nature of item allocation. However, this assignment maximizes the total value each agent can achieve given their preferences.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives 2 items, and all 4 items are distributed. While Agent 1 receives a higher total valuation, the allocation reflects their stronger preferences for the items they receive.
