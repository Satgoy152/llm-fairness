Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  83  22  73
1  26  11  28  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a division that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness is a condition where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0: 97, Item 1: 83, Item 2: 22, Item 3: 73
- Agent 1 values: Item 0: 26, Item 1: 11, Item 2: 28, Item 3: 83

To achieve a fair division, we can use an algorithmic approach such as the Envy-Free Matching or similar methods to allocate these items so that the perceived value for each agent is maximized given their preferences.

A potential allocation could be:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it highly (97) and Agent 1 values it much less (26).
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as both agents value it, but it helps balance the allocation since Agent 1 values it equally (83) compared to Agent 0.
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, because Agent 0 values it significantly (83) and Agent 1 values it much less (11).
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it is valued higher by Agent 1 (28) than by Agent 0 (22).

Now let's check the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1, with a total valuation of 97 + 83 = 180.
- Agent 1 receives Items 3 and 2, with a total valuation of 83 + 28 = 111.

This allocation allows each agent to get the items they value most (relative to the other agent's valuation), aiming to minimize envy.

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
