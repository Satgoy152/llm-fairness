Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

   0   1   2   3
0  6  43  28   0
1  6  81  64  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. The aim is to find an allocation that is either envy-free or minimizes envy as much as possible.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 6
  - Item 1: 43
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 0

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 6
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 64
  - Item 3: 48

We can notice that Agent 1 values item 1 the most, followed by item 2, then item 3, and least item 0. Agent 0 values item 1 the most, followed by item 2, then item 0, and least item 3.

A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items, while ensuring that no agent is envious of the other's allocation (or minimizing envy). 

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (81) and item 2 (64). Let's give Agent 1 these two items since they highly value them.
2. Agent 0 can get item 0 (6) and item 3 (0).

This allocation should be evaluated to check if it minimizes envy, considering preferences and valuations:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3], with a total valuation of 6 + 0 = 6.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2], with a total valuation of 81 + 64 = 145.

With this allocation, Agent 0 receives items with a lower total value than Agent 1, but given the constraints and the initial valuations, we have tried to make the allocation as fair as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures both agents receive an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
