Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  51  97  36  85
1  98  31  59  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to find an allocation that minimizes envy, ideally achieving an envy-free division. Let's review the valuations for each item by each agent:

```
Agent 0: 
- Item 0: 51
- Item 1: 97
- Item 2: 36
- Item 3: 85

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 98
- Item 1: 31
- Item 2: 59
- Item 3: 44
```

One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation, if possible, is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by allocating items based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the most (97) and Item 3 second most (85).
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the most (98) and Item 2 second most (59).
   
2. **Proposed Allocation:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 since it has the highest value for Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 since it has the highest value for Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 since it is the second most valued item for Agent 1.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 since it is the second most valued item for Agent 0.

3. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.

This allocation ensures both agents receive two items each, and both receive their highest and second-highest valued items, which minimizes envy.

### Allocations in JSON format:

{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
