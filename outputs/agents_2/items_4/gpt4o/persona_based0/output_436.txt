Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  27  29  84  33
1  50  39  45  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider both the valuations and the goal of achieving an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [27, 29, 84, 33]
- Agent 1's valuations: [50, 39, 45, 58]

A strategy to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them items they value more highly. Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values this item the most (84), and giving it to Agent 0 would maximize their satisfaction.
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values this item at 27.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values this item at 58, which is the highest among the remaining items.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values this item at 39.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items and maximizes the value they get from their allocated items, which should help in reducing envy:

- Agent 0: Total value = 84 (Item 2) + 27 (Item 0) = 111
- Agent 1: Total value = 58 (Item 3) + 39 (Item 1) = 97

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it does provide a high total value to each agent based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3, 1]
}
```
