Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0   7  36  30   0
1  14  94  94  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the valuations. We have:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 30
  - Item 3: 0

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 14
  - Item 1: 94
  - Item 2: 94
  - Item 3: 96

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent is fairly treated according to their valuations.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - For Agent 1, Item 1, Item 2, and Item 3 have high valuations (94, 94, and 96 respectively).
   - For Agent 0, the highest valued items are Item 1 and Item 2 (36 and 30 respectively).

2. **Maximize Overall Satisfaction:**
   - Since Agent 1 has significantly higher valuations for Items 1, 2, and 3, giving them these items can maximize their satisfaction without affecting Agent 0's satisfaction too much since Agent 0 values these items less.

3. **Fair Allocation:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 (7 vs. 14).
   - Allocate Items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 1 because these items have high valuations for Agent 1 and relatively low or zero value for Agent 0.

### Allocations:

The suggested allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1, 2, and 3.

This allocation attempts to be as fair as possible, considering the significant differences in valuations, particularly for Agent 1.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
