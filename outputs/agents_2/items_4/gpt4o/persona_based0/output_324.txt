Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3
0  24  50  86  72
1  66  32  42  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to minimize potential envy between the agents by considering their valuations. Envy-freeness typically means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over the allocation of others, based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 50
  - Item 2: 86
  - Item 3: 72

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 32
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 66

To achieve envy-freeness, we can try to allocate the items such that each agent gets the items they value relatively more than the other agent. Let's consider the total valuations for each item by each agent:

- For Item 0: 
  - Agent 0: 24
  - Agent 1: 66 
  - Agent 1 values this item more.

- For Item 1: 
  - Agent 0: 50
  - Agent 1: 32
  - Agent 0 values this item more.

- For Item 2: 
  - Agent 0: 86
  - Agent 1: 42
  - Agent 0 values this item more.

- For Item 3: 
  - Agent 0: 72
  - Agent 1: 66
  - Agent 0 values this item more.

Given these valuations, a potential allocation that minimizes envy could be:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it significantly more than Agent 0.
- Assign Items 1, 2, and 3 to Agent 0, as they value these items more than Agent 1.

Now, let's check this allocation:

Agent 0 receives Items 1, 2, and 3, with valuations of 50, 86, and 72, respectively. The total valuation for Agent 0 is 208.

Agent 1 receives Item 0, with a valuation of 66. The total valuation for Agent 1 is 66.

This allocation satisfies the condition that each agent is receiving items they relatively value more, thereby reducing envy. 

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0]
}
```
