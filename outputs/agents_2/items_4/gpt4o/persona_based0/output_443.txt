Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  88  73  44
1  25  65   0  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items between the two agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness is achieved when each agent feels they received at least as much as any other agent according to their own valuation.

Let's analyze the table for each agent's valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 91
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 44

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 0
  - Item 3: 29

Given these valuations, we seek to allocate items to maximize each agent's total value while minimizing potential envy. To start, we can allocate the items with the highest valuation to each agent:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 2. However, since Agent 1 also places a high value on item 1, we must carefully consider the allocation to avoid envy.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 and item 3.

Considering these preferences, a potential fair allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (valued at 91 by Agent 0 and 25 by Agent 1).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 88 by Agent 0 and 65 by Agent 1).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (valued at 73 by Agent 0 and 0 by Agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (valued at 44 by Agent 0 and 29 by Agent 1).

With this allocation, each agent receives items with significant values according to their own valuations. Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, which they value at 91 and 73, respectively. Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3, which they value at 65 and 29, respectively. This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, reducing envy.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
