Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  92  49  58  63
1  34  25  76  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [92, 49, 58, 63]
- Agent 1 values: [34, 25, 76, 95]

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Allocate items in a way that maximizes individual satisfaction and minimizes envy:**

   - Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0.
   - Item 3 is most valued by Agent 1.
   
   Initial allocation:
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Allocate the remaining items:**

   - For Item 1 and Item 2:
     - Item 1: valued at 49 by Agent 0 and 25 by Agent 1.
     - Item 2: valued at 58 by Agent 0 and 76 by Agent 1.
   
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1 to maximize satisfaction while keeping envy minimal.

Thus, the allocations are:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.

The final allocations in the requested JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
