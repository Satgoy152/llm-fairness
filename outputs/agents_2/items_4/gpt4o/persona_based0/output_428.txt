Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  34  19  28  54
1  70  18  74  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while achieving envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should feel that given the allocation, they receive at least as much value as they would if they received the allocation of the other agent.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 54

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 70
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 74
  - Item 3: 65

A straightforward approach is to allocate items to maximize the total value perceived by each agent, while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's examine the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Can be given Item 3 (value 54) and Item 1 (value 19) for a total value of 73.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Can be given Item 0 (value 70) and Item 2 (value 74) for a total value of 144.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and neither agent envies the other because:

- Agent 0 receives items valued at 73, while Agent 1 receives items they value at 70 + 18 = 88 (if they had Agent 0's allocation).
- Agent 1 receives items valued at 144, while Agent 0 receives items they value at 34 + 28 = 62 (if they had Agent 1's allocation).

This allocation appears to be envy-free and fair given the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
