Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  69  15  92
1  32  89  97  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should feel like they received the best possible set of items given the constraints.

First, we need to look at the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- **Agent 0's Valuation:**
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 69
  - Item 2: 15
  - Item 3: 92
  - **Total = 97 + 69 + 15 + 92 = 273**

- **Agent 1's Valuation:**
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 97
  - Item 3: 59
  - **Total = 32 + 89 + 97 + 59 = 277**

The total value Agent 0 assigns to all items is slightly less than the total value Agent 1 assigns. We try to allocate items in such a way that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

One possible allocation strategy could be:

1. **Assign items based on the highest relative valuation difference for each agent.**
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated equals 4, and each agent holds at least one item.

Let's allocate using this strategy:

- Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (97), so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest (97), so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values Item 1 quite high (89), and Agent 0 values it moderately (69), so Item 1 goes to Agent 1.
- The remaining item, Item 3, is valued highly by Agent 0 (92) and moderately by Agent 1 (59), so Item 3 goes to Agent 0.

This allocation results in:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0 and 3
- **Agent 1:** Items 1 and 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and neither agent should envy the other's allocation given their respective valuations.
