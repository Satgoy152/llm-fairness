Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  25  84  53  40
1  68  38  89  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to look at the values each agent places on the items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that the perceived value for each agent is as fair as possible.

Here's the valuation matrix provided:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 53
  - Item 3: 40

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 68
  - Item 1: 38
  - Item 2: 89
  - Item 3: 39

The sum of valuations for each agent can help us understand their overall preference:
- Total value for Agent 0: 202
- Total value for Agent 1: 234

We aim to allocate the items to minimize envy while maximizing each agent's perceived value. Let's try a few possible allocations:

1. Assign items based on highest individual valuations:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 1 (value 84) and Item 0 (value 25).
   - Agent 1 gets Item 2 (value 89) and Item 3 (value 39).

Checking the allocation:
- Agent 0's total value: 84 + 25 = 109
- Agent 1's total value: 89 + 39 = 128

This distribution is relatively fair as both agents receive a substantial portion of their total valuation. It minimizes envy since each agent receives items that are highly valued by them.

Based on the fair division and the goal to minimize envy, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items, while keeping the allocation as fair as possible given the constraints.
