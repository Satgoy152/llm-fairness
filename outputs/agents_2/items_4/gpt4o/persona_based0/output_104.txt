Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3
0  88   0  67  58
1  73  73  52  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, considering the valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we need to follow a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while keeping the allocation equitable. Here's how we can approach this problem:

1. **Understand the Valuations**:  
   - Agent 0 values items as follows:  
     - Item 0: 88  
     - Item 1: 0  
     - Item 2: 67  
     - Item 3: 58  
   - Agent 1 values items as follows:  
     - Item 0: 73  
     - Item 1: 73  
     - Item 2: 52  
     - Item 3: 55  

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Value**:  
   - Start by allocating items to the agents based on their highest valuation to minimize envy and ensure each agent gets the most valued items according to their preferences.

3. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for Item 0 (88). Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has equal highest value for Item 1 and Item 0 (both 73), but since Item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - For the remaining items, we continue the process:
     - Agent 0’s next highest valued item is Item 2 (67).
     - Agent 1’s next highest valued remaining item is Item 3 (55).

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 and Item 3 to Agent 1.

By following these steps, we ensure that both agents receive items that align with their preferences, and the allocation is envy-free as each agent receives their highest possible valued items given the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
