Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  40  27  84
1  82  29  45  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the items among the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is envy-free to the extent possible. We have two agents (0 and 1) and four items (0, 1, 2, and 3).

First, let's summarize the values each agent assigns to each item:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 27
  - Item 3: 84

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 82
  - Item 1: 29
  - Item 2: 45
  - Item 3: 37

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 3 Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 84.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 82.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 0 Allocation:**
   - After allocating item 3 to Agent 0, we look at the remaining items.
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (82).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 1 and Item 2 Allocation:**
   - Now, we have items 1 and 2 remaining.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 40 and item 2 at 27.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 29 and item 2 at 45.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (since 45 is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 27).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

With this allocation, we ensure that each agent gets two items. Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3, and Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2. This distribution minimizes envy since each agent receives items they value relatively highly.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, and we have allocated all 4 items as required.
