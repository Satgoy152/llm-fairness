Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3
0   3   3  32  88
1  51  58  65  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible. This means ensuring that each agent values their allocation as much as or more than the allocation given to the other agent. In situations where envy-freeness cannot be strictly achieved due to specific constraints, we attempt to balance the allocations to minimize envy.

Let's first look at the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 3
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 32
  - Item 3: 88

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 65
  - Item 3: 21

Given these valuations, one approach is to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while considering the following:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (88), whereas agent 1 values item 2 (65) the most.
2. Allocating item 3 to agent 0 and item 2 to agent 1 aligns well with each agent's preferences.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 1) to ensure fairness. Agent 1 values item 1 more than item 0, while Agent 0 values them equally (though very low).

A fair allocation, considering the preferences, could be:

- Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (88 is the highest value for agent 0)
- Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (65 is the highest value for agent 1)

Now for the remaining items:

- Allocate item 1 to agent 1 (agent 1 values it higher than item 0)
- Allocate item 0 to agent 0 (to balance the number of items and given agent 0's low equal value for both)

With this allocation, each agent gets a total of 2 items. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, and agent 1 receives items 1 and 2. This allocation aims to minimize envy by maximizing each agent's total valuation based on their preferences.
