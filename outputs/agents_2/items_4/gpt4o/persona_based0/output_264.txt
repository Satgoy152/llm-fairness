Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  54  47  15
1  99  44  59   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or at least minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer the bundle of items received by another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 54
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 15

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 0

One strategy for allocation is to maximize the total utility for each agent while trying to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation. 

First, let's look at the highest valuations for each item:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (99)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (54)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (59)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 0 (15)

Based on these valuations, we can try to assign items according to who values them more, ensuring each agent gets two items since there are four items in total:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 since they value it more (99 vs. 36).
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 since they value it more (54 vs. 44).
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 since they value it more (59 vs. 47).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 since they value it more (15 vs. 0).

This allocation gives each agent two items, and each agent receives the items they value the most highly that are still available. This should help minimize envy.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
