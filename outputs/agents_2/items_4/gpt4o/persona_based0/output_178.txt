Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  70  89  99
1  14  81  57   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to make each agent as satisfied as possible with their allocation, given their preferences.

### Valuations Table
- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 89
  - Item 3: 99

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 14
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 57
  - Item 3: 3

### Steps for Fair Allocation
1. **Rank the items for each agent based on their preferences**:
   - Agent 0: 3 (99), 2 (89), 1 (70), 0 (48)
   - Agent 1: 1 (81), 2 (57), 0 (14), 3 (3)

2. **Consider allocations that maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring total allocation of items is 4**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 3, followed by items 2, 1, and 0.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1, followed by items 2, 0, and 3.

3. **Allocate items based on the highest value preferences, attempting to minimize envy**:
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)

4. **Allocate remaining items considering next highest preferences**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest remaining value for Agent 0)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest remaining value for Agent 1)

### Final Allocation
This allocation seeks to maximize the satisfaction of both agents based on their individual valuations while ensuring each receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives the items they value most (3 and 2), and Agent 1 receives the items they value most (1 and 0), given the constraints.
