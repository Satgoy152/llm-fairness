Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  54  72   1
1  63  74  97  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as highly as possible, ideally without any agent feeling like another agent received a more valuable bundle.

Let's examine the valuations provided by each agent:

- **Agent 0** values:
  - Item 0 at 89
  - Item 1 at 54
  - Item 2 at 72
  - Item 3 at 1

- **Agent 1** values:
  - Item 0 at 63
  - Item 1 at 74
  - Item 2 at 97
  - Item 3 at 24

We can follow these steps to find a fair and envy-free allocation:

1. **Pair items with highest valuations by agents**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (97), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (89), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Allocate remaining items based on relative valuations**:
   - For the remaining items 1 and 3, compare the valuations:
     - Agent 0 values item 1 at 54 and item 3 at 1.
     - Agent 1 values item 1 at 74 and item 3 at 24.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (since they have a higher valuation for it).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (as it is the only remaining item).

With this allocation, both agents receive two items, and the items are distributed in a way that maximizes total satisfaction based on their valuations, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
