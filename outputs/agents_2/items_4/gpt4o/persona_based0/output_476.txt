Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3
0  50  70  17  75
1  39  71  42   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, which means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Given the valuations provided, we need to consider both the total value each agent derives from their allocated items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 50
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 75

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 3

To achieve a fair division, let's perform the following allocation:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values item 0 at 39 and Agent 0 values it at 50. While Agent 0 values it more, this allocation balances other allocations.
   
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it at 70 and Agent 1 values it at 71. This allocation satisfies Agent 0 significantly.

3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it at 42, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 17.

4. Finally, allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it at 75, far more than Agent 1's valuation of 3.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 items 1 and 3, with a total valuation of 70 + 75 = 145.
- Agent 1 items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 39 + 42 = 81.

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0's allocation is worth 145, which is more than Agent 1's allocation of 81.
- Agent 1's allocation of 81 is the best they can do given the allocations, as swapping any item would not increase their total value.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
