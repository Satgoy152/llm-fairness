Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0   5  70  39  70
1  75  47  99  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution. This means each agent should feel they have received an allocation that is at least as good as any other allocation given that they are aware of the other agent's preferences.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [5, 70, 39, 70]
- Agent 1's valuations: [75, 47, 99, 25]

We need to allocate the four items such that each agent is satisfied based on these valuations.

Let's consider a potential fair allocation:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (99) and item 0 (75), making these items particularly important to them. Allocating these items to Agent 1 could help ensure they feel satisfied with their allocation.

2. Agent 0 values items 1 (70) and 3 (70) equally, and these are their highest valued items. Allocating these items to Agent 0 could ensure they feel satisfied with their allocation.

Thus, a fair allocation could be:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction given the constraints.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
