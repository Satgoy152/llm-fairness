Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  72  38  63
1  40  60  81  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items to the agents such that each agent receives a bundle of items they value as much as possible, without causing envy. In this scenario, we have two agents and four items. Let's consider how we can allocate these items fairly:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 97
- Item 1: 72
- Item 2: 38
- Item 3: 63

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 40
- Item 1: 60
- Item 2: 81
- Item 3: 98

A common approach for two agents is to allocate the items by maximizing each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while ensuring that neither envies the other's allocation.

Let's examine possible allocations:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 and Item 3 to Agent 1. These are the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1. This way, both agents get a reasonably high-valued item as their second item.

This allocation would result in:

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1:
- Total valuation for Agent 0: 97 + 72 = 169

Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3:
- Total valuation for Agent 1: 81 + 98 = 179

Both agents get two items, and the allocation is envy-free because each agent receives a combination of items they value highly without preferring the other agent's allocation over their own.

Thus, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
