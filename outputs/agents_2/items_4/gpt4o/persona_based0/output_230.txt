Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  85  39  25
1  91  50  60  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle. Given the valuations, we can use a simple approach to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy.

Here are the valuations of the agents for each item:

- Agent 0: Item 0: 76, Item 1: 85, Item 2: 39, Item 3: 25
- Agent 1: Item 0: 91, Item 1: 50, Item 2: 60, Item 3: 40

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the method of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Let us examine the options:

1. Agent 0 values Item 1 the most at 85.
2. Agent 1 values Item 0 the most at 91.

Allocating these items based on their highest valued item would give:
- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 0

For the remaining items, we consider the next highest values:
- For Agent 0, the next highest value is Item 0 (76), but it's already allocated to Agent 1.
- For Agent 1, the next highest value is Item 2 (60).

Since Agent 1 has Item 0 with a high value, we give Agent 0 the next highest item they value, which is Item 2 (39), leaving Item 3 for Agent 1.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 1, Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 0, Item 3

This allocation is envy-free as neither agent would prefer to swap their bundle with the other given the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
