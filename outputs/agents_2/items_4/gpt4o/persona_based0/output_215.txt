Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3
0   5  52  75  66
1  48  63  16  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that no agent feels envious of the other's allocation. Let's look at the table of valuations:

```
       0   1   2   3
Agent 0:  5  52  75  66
Agent 1: 48  63  16  78
```

To find an envy-free allocation, we can use a method where we try to minimize the potential for envy by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since we have an equal number of items and agents, we must ensure each agent ends up with two items.

Let's go through the items:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values at 5
   - Agent 1 values at 48
   - Allocate to Agent 1

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values at 52
   - Agent 1 values at 63
   - Allocate to Agent 1

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values at 75
   - Agent 1 values at 16
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values at 66
   - Agent 1 values at 78
   - Allocate to Agent 1

Now, we have allocated three items to Agent 1 and one to Agent 0, which violates our requirement of each agent getting two items. To balance the allocation, let's re-evaluate a fair and envy-free distribution:

Revised Allocation:
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (52) instead of Agent 1 (63)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (66) instead of Agent 1 (78)

This adjustment balances the allocation as each agent gets two items:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive two items and aims to reduce envy by providing a relatively balanced total valuation for each agent.
