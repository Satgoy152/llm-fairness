Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  79  87  67
1   8  55  72  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering the valuations, we aim to ensure an envy-free distribution, where no agent would prefer the other's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Let's compute the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(44 + 79 + 87 + 67 = 277\)
- Agent 1: \(8 + 55 + 72 + 96 = 231\)

Now, let's calculate the proportional share for each agent, which is half the total valuation of all items since there are two agents:

Total valuation of all items: \(277 + 231 = 508\)

Proportional share for each agent: \(508 / 2 = 254\)

Let's allocate the items to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent's share is as close as possible to their proportional share.

Consider the following allocations:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as it has the highest value for them:  
   Value for agent 0: \(87\)

2. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as it has the highest value for them:
   Value for agent 1: \(96\)

3. Assign item 1 to agent 0, who values it higher than agent 1:
   Value for agent 0: \(79 + 87 = 166\)

4. Assign item 0 to agent 0 as it maximizes their valuation:
   Value for agent 0: \(44 + 79 + 87 = 210\)

Let's check if any agent envies the other:

- Agent 0's allocation: items 0, 1, 2 (Value: \(44 + 79 + 87 = 210\))
- Agent 1's allocation: item 3 (Value: \(96\))

Agent 0 has no envy because their total valuation exceeds agent 1's allocation value. Agent 1 has no envy because they received the item they value the most.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3]
}
```
