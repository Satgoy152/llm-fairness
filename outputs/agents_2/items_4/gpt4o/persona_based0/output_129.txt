Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  10  16  51
1  47  34   3  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 87
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 16
  - Item 3: 51

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 3
  - Item 3: 51

A fair division approach is to try to maximize the minimum satisfaction an agent receives, ensuring each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Assign the highest value item for each agent:**
   - Agent 0's highest value is Item 0 (87).
   - Agent 1's highest value is Item 3 (51).

2. **Check the remaining items and valuations:**
   - Remaining items are Item 1 and Item 2.
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 10 and Item 2 at 16.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 34 and Item 2 at 3.

3. **Assign remaining items to ensure overall fairness:**
   - It is beneficial to assign Item 1 to Agent 1 because they value it significantly more than Agent 0 (34 vs 10).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 since it prevents Agent 0 from feeling significantly undervalued and it aligns with Agent 0's second-highest preference for the remaining items.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives: Item 0 and Item 2
- **Agent 1** receives: Item 1 and Item 3

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's highest value items while distributing the remaining items in a way that minimizes envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
