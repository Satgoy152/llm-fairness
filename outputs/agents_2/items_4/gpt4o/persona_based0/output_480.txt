Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  73  63  39
1  11  99  89  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations in such a way that the allocation is envy-free or at least minimizes envy, given each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [4, 73, 63, 39]
- Agent 1's valuations: [11, 99, 89, 66]

Given these valuations, we aim to allocate the items to minimize the potential envy between the agents.

One possible allocation that attempts to balance the distribution is:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it is the most valued by Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is also highly valued by Agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it is the least valued by both agents, but better suits Agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it is more valuable to Agent 0 than to Agent 1.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 3]
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 2]

This way, each agent receives two items, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent the items they value highly.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
