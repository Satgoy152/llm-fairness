Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  33  56   0  82
1  21  61  76  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to analyze the valuations provided by each agent for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's start by reviewing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 56
  - Item 2: 0
  - Item 3: 82

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 76
  - Item 3: 33

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items by maximizing the satisfaction of each agent while ensuring envy-freeness.

### Proposed Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: 33
   - Item 3: 82

   Total valuation for Agent 0: 33 + 82 = 115

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1: 61
   - Item 2: 76

   Total valuation for Agent 1: 61 + 76 = 137

### Analysis:
- With this allocation, Agent 0 receives items with a total value of 115 according to their valuation, and Agent 1 receives items valued at 137 according to their valuation.
- Agent 0's total valuation (115) is higher than the value they would assign to Agent 1's bundle (61 + 0 = 61).
- Agent 1's total valuation (137) is higher than the value they would assign to Agent 0's bundle (21 + 33 = 54).

Thus, neither agent envies the other's allocation, achieving envy-freeness.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
