Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3
0  93  62  94  45
1  67  72   3  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1) while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy between the agents. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the other agent's allocation according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 62
  - Item 2: 94
  - Item 3: 45

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 3
  - Item 3: 28

A possible envy-free allocation would be:

- Assign Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 and Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation is chosen because:

1. Agent 0 receives items with a combined valuation of 93 (Item 0) + 94 (Item 2) = 187.
2. Agent 1 receives items with a combined valuation of 72 (Item 1) + 28 (Item 3) = 100.

Both agents receive items they highly value, and the allocation attempts to balance the perceived fairness from each agent's perspective.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
