Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3
0  44  54  95   4
1  87  31  25  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division, we should aim for an allocation where no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their valuations. Let's examine the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [44, 54, 95, 4]
Agent 1: [87, 31, 25, 47]
```

We want to allocate the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and ideally, the allocation should minimize envy.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highly (95).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 highly (87).

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Give Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Give Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items left are 1 and 3.

4. **Evaluate Remaining Items:**
   - For item 1:
     - Agent 0 values it at 54, Agent 1 at 31.
   - For item 3:
     - Agent 0 values it at 4, Agent 1 at 47.

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Give Item 1 to Agent 0 (higher valuation for Agent 0).
   - Give Item 3 to Agent 1 (higher valuation for Agent 1).

This allocation minimizes envy based on the highest preferences.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and attempts to minimize potential envy by aligning item allocations with higher individual valuations.
