Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3
0  64  35  77  77
1  90  78  49  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while trying to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of each item. Our goal is to allocate the items so that neither agent envies the other's allocation, as much as possible given the constraints.

The valuations are given as follows:

- Agent 0: [64, 35, 77, 77]
- Agent 1: [90, 78, 49, 16]

To achieve a fair division and minimize envy, we'll start by looking at the highest value each agent places on the items, trying to balance the overall value each agent receives.

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for items 2 and 3 (both 77).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for items 0 (90) and 1 (78).

A simple allocation that can minimize envy based on the given valuations is:

- **Agent 0** receives items 2 and 3, giving them a total valuation of 154.
- **Agent 1** receives items 0 and 1, giving them a total valuation of 168.

This allocation gives each agent two items and attempts to balance their satisfaction based on their highest valuations. While it's difficult to achieve perfect envy-freeness due to different valuation scales, this allocation respects the highest preferences each agent has for specific items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
