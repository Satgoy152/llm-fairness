Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  84  40  68
1  94  98  50  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that considers the agents' valuations and seeks to minimize envy between them. The goal is to allocate items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [60, 84, 40, 68]
- Agent 1's valuations: [94, 98, 50, 54]

We'll use a procedure that tries to balance the total value each agent receives. One straightforward approach is to prioritize items based on total value to both agents and see if we can distribute them fairly.

1. Item 1 is most valued by both agents (84 by Agent 0 and 98 by Agent 1), we should allocate it to the agent who values it more: Agent 1.
2. Item 0 is next valued highest in total, with Agent 1 valuing it at 94 and Agent 0 at 60. Giving it to Agent 1 would disproportionately increase their total value, so we assign it to Agent 0.
3. Item 3 has a higher total value than Item 2 (68+54 vs. 40+50). We allocate it to Agent 0 to balance the total values.
4. Finally, Item 2 is left for Agent 1.

Let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, with a total valuation of 60 + 68 = 128.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, with a total valuation of 98 + 50 = 148.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, given their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
