Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  74  52  87  15
1  94  39  86  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy occurs when one agent values the set of items allocated to another agent more than their own set. One way to ensure fairness is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where neither agent prefers the other's allocation over their own.

Given the valuation matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 74     | 52     | 87     | 15     |
| 1     | 94     | 39     | 86     | 19     |

We will analyze different allocations to ensure fairness:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (87), followed by item 0 (74).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (94), followed by item 2 (86).

2. **Potential Envy-Free Allocation**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 to satisfy their highest valuation.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 to satisfy their highest valuation.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 and item 3 to Agent 1, balancing the remaining value distribution.

3. **Valuation under Proposed Allocation**:
   - **Agent 0**: Items [1, 2] – Total valuation: 52 + 87 = 139
   - **Agent 1**: Items [0, 3] – Total valuation: 94 + 19 = 113

4. **Envy Check**:
   - Agent 0 values Agent 1's allocation (item 0 and 3) as 74 + 15 = 89, which is less than their own valuation of 139.
   - Agent 1 values Agent 0's allocation (item 1 and 2) as 39 + 86 = 125, which is more than their own valuation of 113.

To reduce envy further, we can try switching item 1 and 3:

5. **Revised Allocation**:
   - **Agent 0**: Items [0, 3] – Total valuation: 74 + 15 = 89
   - **Agent 1**: Items [1, 2] – Total valuation: 39 + 86 = 125

6. **Revised Envy Check**:
   - Agent 0 values Agent 1's allocation (item 1 and 2) as 52 + 87 = 139, which is more than their own valuation of 89.
   - Agent 1 values Agent 0's allocation (item 0 and 3) as 94 + 19 = 113, which is less than their own valuation of 125.

The revised allocation reduces envy for Agent 1, but increases it for Agent 0. However, given the constraints and valuations, this is a reasonable allocation to minimize overall envy.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
