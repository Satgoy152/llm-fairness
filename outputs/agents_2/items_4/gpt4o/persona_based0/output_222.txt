Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  55  62  86
1  68  13  43  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [8, 55, 62, 86]
- Agent 1: [68, 13, 43, 60]

One approach to ensure fairness is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while minimizing potential envy. We can start by assigning the items that each agent values the most.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Initial High-Valuation Assignments**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the most (86), and agent 1 values item 0 the most (68).

2. **Remaining Items**:
   - After assigning item 3 to agent 0 and item 0 to agent 1, items 1 and 2 remain.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 second-highest (62), and agent 1 values item 2 more than item 1 (43 vs. 13).

3. **Fairness Adjustment**:
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0, as it provides a higher valuation addition to agent 0 than to agent 1.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1, as agent 0 has already received higher-valued items.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent gets, considering their individual valuations.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, with an attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
