Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  28  11  12  71
1  87  96  88  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 11 12 71]
 [87 96 88 50]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuation of the items.

### Valuations:
- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 71

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 87
  - Item 1: 96
  - Item 2: 88
  - Item 3: 50

### Total Valuations:
- **Agent 0 Total Valuation:** 
  - 28 + 11 + 12 + 71 = 122
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation:** 
  - 87 + 96 + 88 + 50 = 321

### Observations:
Agent 1 values the items significantly higher in total compared to Agent 0. To achieve a fair division, we should aim to distribute the items such that both agents feel they have received an equitable share based on their personal valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Allocate the highest valued item of each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 the most (71), so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (96), so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Allocate remaining items to balance total perceived value:**
   - Remaining items are 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 (88) significantly more than Item 0 (87), so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate the remaining Item 0 to Agent 0.

### Resulting Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 3
- **Agent 1:** Items 1, 2

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent given their individual valuations.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
