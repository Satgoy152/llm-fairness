Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0  25  31  70   5
1  95  85   8  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure both agents receive a fair share based on their preferences. Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 31
  - Item 2: 70
  - Item 3: 5

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 85
  - Item 2: 8
  - Item 3: 19

First, we calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 25 + 31 + 70 + 5 = 131
- Total value for Agent 1: 95 + 85 + 8 + 19 = 207

To achieve a fair division, we need to allocate items in a way that each agent receives a portion of the total value that reflects their preferences and minimizes envy.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0:
   - This is the most valuable item for Agent 0.

2. Assign Items 0 and 1 to Agent 1:
   - These items are highly valued by Agent 1.

3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0:
   - This ensures that both agents receive two items each, and Item 3 is the least valued item for both agents.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3:
  - Total valuation for Agent 0 = 70 (Item 2) + 5 (Item 3) = 75

- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1:
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 = 95 (Item 0) + 85 (Item 1) = 180

This allocation gives Agent 0 a fair share considering their preferences, while Agent 1 receives the items they highly value, minimizing envy. Both agents receive two items, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
