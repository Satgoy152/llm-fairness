Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  65   4  36  23
1  98  92  45  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness among the agents, we must consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. We'll aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives a bundle they value at least as much as the other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [65, 4, 36, 23]
- Agent 1's valuations: [98, 92, 45, 41]

Let's compute the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 65 + 4 + 36 + 23 = 128
- Total value for Agent 1: 98 + 92 + 45 + 41 = 276

We will try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's valuation while minimizing envy.

### Allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: This item gives the highest value to Agent 1 (98) and is also the most valuable item for Agent 0 (65).
2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: This item gives a very high value to Agent 1 (92) and a low value to Agent 0 (4).
3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: This item gives a moderate value to Agent 0 (36) and a lower value to Agent 1 (45).
4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**: This item gives a moderate value to Agent 0 (23) and a lower value to Agent 1 (41).

### Resulting Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3, which they value at 36 + 23 = 59.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1, which they value at 98 + 92 = 190.

This allocation ensures that Agent 1 receives the items they value the most, reducing potential envy, while Agent 0 receives the remaining items, which provides them the best possible value from the available options.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
