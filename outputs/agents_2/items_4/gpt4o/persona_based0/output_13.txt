Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  27  10  67  73
1  56  64  12  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to aim for an envy-free distribution. This means each agent should feel that they received at least as much value as the other agent did, given their own valuations.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0 at 27
  - Item 1 at 10
  - Item 2 at 67
  - Item 3 at 73

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 56
  - Item 1 at 64
  - Item 2 at 12
  - Item 3 at 95

To search for an envy-free allocation, we can consider different distributions and check for envy-freeness:

1. **Allocate items based on maximizing individual agent's valuations:**
   - Agent 0 gets items (2, 3) because they have the highest value for these items.
   - Agent 1 gets items (0, 1) because these maximize their combined value.

2. **Calculate the allocations:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 2 (67) and item 3 (73), with a total value of 140.
   - Agent 1 receives item 0 (56) and item 1 (64), with a total value of 120.

3. **Check for envy-freeness:**
   - Agent 0 values Agent 1's allocation at 27 (item 0) + 10 (item 1) = 37.
   - Agent 1 values Agent 0's allocation at 12 (item 2) + 95 (item 3) = 107.

Both agents prefer their own allocations to the other's allocations, thus making the distribution envy-free.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
