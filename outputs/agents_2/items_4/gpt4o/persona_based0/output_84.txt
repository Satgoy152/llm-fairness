Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3
0  79  11  17  19
1  70  69  28  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items such that each agent feels that they received a fair share based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing each person's minimum satisfaction. One approach to achieve this is by using the "Envy-Free" allocation principle, where no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 = 79, Item 1 = 11, Item 2 = 17, Item 3 = 19
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 = 70, Item 1 = 69, Item 2 = 28, Item 3 = 49

To find an allocation that is fair, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair set of items, considering their own valuations.

Let's attempt to allocate items in a way that balances out their valuations:

1. Agent 0 values Item 0 significantly higher than other items, so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values Item 1 almost as much as Item 0, so we allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. For the remaining items (2 and 3), we need to decide based on remaining preferences:
   - Agent 0 has lower values for Items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 higher than Item 2.

Therefore, a fair allocation could be:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their own valuations, as Agent 0 receives their highest-valued item, and Agent 1 receives their second-highest-valued item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
