Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1  2   3
0  52  69  6  76
1  39  22  5  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy. The goal is to allocate items such that both agents are as satisfied as possible with their share according to their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuation matrix:

```
    0   1  2   3
0  52  69  6  76
1  39  22  5  39
```

Agent 0 values the items as follows:
- Item 0: 52
- Item 1: 69
- Item 2: 6
- Item 3: 76

Agent 1 values the items as follows:
- Item 0: 39
- Item 1: 22
- Item 2: 5
- Item 3: 39

To allocate the items fairly, we aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 3**: This item has the highest value for Agent 0 (76), and it is equally valued by Agent 1 (39). Allocating this to Agent 0 maximizes their total valuation.
2. **Item 1**: The next highest value for Agent 0 is Item 1 (69), which is also the second least valuable for Agent 1 (22). Giving this to Agent 0 aligns with maximizing Agent 0's valuation.
3. **Item 0**: This item is valued at 52 by Agent 0 and 39 by Agent 1. Allocating it to Agent 1 helps balance the total value each agent receives.
4. **Item 2**: This item is least valued by both agents (6 for Agent 0 and 5 for Agent 1). Giving it to Agent 1 complements the allocations to ensure both agents receive two items each.

By following this allocation, we balance the overall value received by each agent and maintain a fair division considering their valuations.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent two items, maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations while maintaining a fair distribution of items.
