Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3
0  65  98  83  42
1  75  59  57  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we first need to calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and then try to distribute these items in a manner that minimizes envy.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 65  
  - Item 1: 98  
  - Item 2: 83  
  - Item 3: 42  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 75  
  - Item 1: 59  
  - Item 2: 57  
  - Item 3: 56  

Let's compute the total value that each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 65 + 98 + 83 + 42 = 288
- Agent 1's total valuation: 75 + 59 + 57 + 56 = 247

Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent perceives they got an equal or fair share relative to their total valuation, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's look at the valuations and try to allocate the items to minimize envy:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (98), and Agent 1 values it at 59.  
   - This item contributes significantly to Agent 0â€™s perceived fairness.

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest (75), and Agent 0 values it at 65.  
   - This allocation helps balance the valuation as Agent 1 gains a high-value item from their perspective.

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 83, whereas Agent 1 values it at 57.  
   - This allocation gives Agent 0 a good value, balancing the perceived fairness.

4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 at 56, whereas Agent 0 values it at 42.  
   - This allocation helps Agent 1 get a fair share relative to their valuation.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 3.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on the highest relative valuations for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
