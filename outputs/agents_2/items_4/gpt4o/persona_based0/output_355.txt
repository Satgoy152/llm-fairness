Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3
0  41  10  11  42
1  37  76   3  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [37 76  3 89]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. We'll start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation**: 41 (Item 0) + 10 (Item 1) + 11 (Item 2) + 42 (Item 3) = 104
- **Agent 1's total valuation**: 37 (Item 0) + 76 (Item 1) + 3 (Item 2) + 89 (Item 3) = 205

Now, let's consider different allocations to ensure fairness:

1. **Item 3** has the highest valuation for both agents, but Agent 1 values it significantly more (89 vs 42). Allocating Item 3 to Agent 1 helps balance the high value disparity.
   
2. **Item 1** has a higher valuation for Agent 1 (76 vs 10). Allocating this to Agent 1 aligns with their preferences.

3. **Item 0** has a slightly higher valuation for Agent 0 (41 vs 37). Allocating this to Agent 0 is reasonable.

4. **Item 2** is valued more by Agent 0 (11 vs 3). Allocating this to Agent 0 seems fair since Agent 1 has already obtained the high-value items.

Given these considerations, a fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 3.

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent receives and minimizes envy. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
