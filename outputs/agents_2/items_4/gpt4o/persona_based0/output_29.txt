Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  72  45  32  34
1  56  45  96  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the integer constraints. This means that each agent should not prefer the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle. 

Let's start by looking at the valuation table:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 72 | 45 | 32 | 34 |
| 1            | 56 | 45 | 96 | 15 |

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations, while ensuring that no agent feels they would prefer the other's allocation.

First, let's calculate the total valuation for each item by both agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 72, Agent 1 values it at 56.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 values it at 45.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 32, Agent 1 values it at 96.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 34, Agent 1 values it at 15.

Let's proceed with the allocation by trying to minimize envy:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it the highest (96 vs. 32).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1 (72 vs. 56).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because both value it equally, and Agent 0 needs more value after item 0.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 since Agent 0 already has two items and this keeps the allocation balanced.

Now, let's list the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.

This allocation is balanced in terms of number of items, and attempts to minimize the envy between agents.

Here are the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
