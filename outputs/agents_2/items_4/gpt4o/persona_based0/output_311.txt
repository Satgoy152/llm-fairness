Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

   0   1   2   3
0  3  53  90  21
1  7  52  40  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that each agent feels they have received their fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 3
  - Item 1: 53
  - Item 2: 90
  - Item 3: 21

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 52
  - Item 2: 40
  - Item 3: 70

A possible allocation that aims for fairness could be:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because it's the highest valued item for Agent 0 (90) and significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation (40).
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 because it's the highest valued item for Agent 1 (70) and relatively low valued by Agent 0 (21).
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 because it's the next highest valued item for Agent 0 (53) and almost equally valued by Agent 1 (52).
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because although it's not highly valued by either agent, it is slightly more valued by Agent 1 (7 vs 3).

This allocation results in:

- For Agent 0: Total valuation = 90 (Item 2) + 53 (Item 1) = 143
- For Agent 1: Total valuation = 70 (Item 3) + 7 (Item 0) = 77

This distribution gives Agent 0 more value, but it reflects the fact that Agent 0 had higher valuations for the items. The allocation is envy-free since each agent receives their most valued available items.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
