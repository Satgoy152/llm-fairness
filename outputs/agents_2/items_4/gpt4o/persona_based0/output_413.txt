Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3
0   0  88  31  88
1  77  58  32  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [77 58 32 14]]
Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should feel that their allocated bundle is at least as valuable as the bundle of the other agent, according to their own valuations.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0 values the items as: [0, 88, 31, 88]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [77, 58, 32, 14]

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (77), and Agent 0 values it the least (0).

2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 as 88, which is their highest valuation for any item.

3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 as 32, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 31.

4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 as 88, which is their highest valuation for any item, and Agent 1 values it the least (14).

The allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.

This allocation ensures both agents are satisfied with their bundles as each receives items they value highly.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
