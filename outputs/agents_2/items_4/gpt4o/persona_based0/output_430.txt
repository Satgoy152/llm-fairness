Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  43  33  40  14
1  45   8  85   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can apply a method such as the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or other fair division algorithms. However, given the simplicity of the scenario with only two agents and four items, we can attempt a direct approach by balancing their total perceived values.

Let's examine the values:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 43 
  - Item 1: 33 
  - Item 2: 40 
  - Item 3: 14

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 45 
  - Item 1: 8 
  - Item 2: 85 
  - Item 3: 3

We aim to distribute the items such that both agents have a similar total valuation of the items they receive. Here’s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item with Highest Value Difference**: 
   - Item 2 has a high valuation difference (85 for Agent 1 and 40 for Agent 0). Allocating this item to Agent 1 would significantly benefit them and reduce potential envy.

2. **Considering Remaining Items**:
   - After allocating Item 2 to Agent 1, we examine other items. 
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 fairly high (43 compared to Agent 1’s 45), making it reasonable to allocate this to Agent 0.

3. **Balancing Remaining Valuations**:
   - With Item 0 allocated to Agent 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1, we need to distribute Items 1 and 3.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (33 vs. 8) and Item 3 to Agent 1 (3 vs. 14). This ensures that both agents receive items where they have relatively higher valuations.

4. **Final Allocation Check**:
   - Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1, with total valuation: 43 + 33 = 76.
   - Agent 1 receives Items 2 and 3, with total valuation: 85 + 3 = 88.
   - This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value without significant envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
