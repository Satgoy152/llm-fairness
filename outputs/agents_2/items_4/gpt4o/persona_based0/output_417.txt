Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3
0  55  44  92  93
1  73   8  53  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent would prefer to have the allocation received by any other agent over their own allocation, given their valuations.

Firstly, let's review the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [55, 44, 92, 93]
- Agent 1's valuations: [73, 8, 53, 72]

Now, we'll try to allocate the items such that the allocation is envy-free, or at least close to it. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that no agent envies the other, if possible.

Let's calculate the total value each agent has for all items:
- Total value for Agent 0: 55 + 44 + 92 + 93 = 284
- Total value for Agent 1: 73 + 8 + 53 + 72 = 206

Now, we will consider allocations that aim to balance these totals as evenly as possible between the agents.

A potential allocation:
- Assign items 0 and 3 to Agent 1:
  - Agent 1's total value: 73 (item 0) + 72 (item 3) = 145
  - Agent 0's total value from remaining items: 44 (item 1) + 92 (item 2) = 136

This allocation slightly favors Agent 1 in terms of total value, but we can adjust:

Let's try:
- Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 0:
  - Agent 0's total value: 92 (item 2) + 93 (item 3) = 185
- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 1:
  - Agent 1's total value: 73 (item 0) + 8 (item 1) = 81

This allocation gives Agent 0 a significantly higher total value, leading to potential envy from Agent 1. We need a better balance.

Let's adjust again:

- Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 1:
  - Agent 1's total value: 73 (item 0) + 53 (item 2) = 126
- Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 0:
  - Agent 0's total value: 44 (item 1) + 93 (item 3) = 137

This allocation is closer in terms of total valuation balance, but Agent 0 has a slight advantage.

After evaluating different allocations and considering envy-freeness, we choose the following allocation, which attempts to be as balanced as possible:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items such that both agents receive a reasonable value relative to their preferences, minimizing potential envy.
