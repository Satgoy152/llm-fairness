Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3
0  36   0  81  40
1  83  52  77  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as the other's bundle.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 3: 40

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 83
  - Item 1: 52
  - Item 2: 77
  - Item 3: 83

Given these valuations, we can follow a process to allocate items fairly:

1. **Agent 1 has a higher valuation for Item 0**, which is 83, compared to Agent 0's 36. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest**, at 81, while Agent 1 values it at 77. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
3. For **Item 3**, both agents have the same valuation of 83, but since Agent 0 has only one item so far, allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
4. Finally, **Item 1 is left**, and its valuation is higher for Agent 1 (52) than Agent 0 (0). Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1

Now, let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that is envy-free based on their individual valuations.
