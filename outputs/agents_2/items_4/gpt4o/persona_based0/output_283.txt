Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  67  81  50  69
1  43  48  74  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy. In simple terms, we want to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share, based on their own valuations.

Let's evaluate the valuations and attempt to distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0's valuations:**  
   - Item 0: 67
   - Item 1: 81
   - Item 2: 50
   - Item 3: 69

2. **Agent 1's valuations:**  
   - Item 0: 43
   - Item 1: 48
   - Item 2: 74
   - Item 3: 90

To achieve fairness, we can aim for an allocation such that neither agent envies the other's allocation. A simple way to start is by considering each agent's highest-valued items and attempting to balance the total valuation each receives.

Let's try the following allocation:

- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0** (highest value for Agent 0)
- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1** (highest value for Agent 1)

After assigning these two items, we need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 2) such that the total value received by each agent is approximately balanced.

- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent:

- **Agent 0's total valuation:** 81 (Item 1) + 67 (Item 0) = 148
- **Agent 1's total valuation:** 90 (Item 3) + 74 (Item 2) = 164

This allocation gives both agents items and attempts to balance their total perceived value as closely as possible given the constraints. Agent 1 has a slightly higher total valuation, but this allocation minimizes the potential for envy given the distributions.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
