Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  78  82  26  75
1  26   3  47   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and attempt envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share. Envy-freeness can be difficult to achieve perfectly with indivisible goods, but we can try to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 0: 78, 1: 82, 2: 26, 3: 75
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 0: 26, 1: 3, 2: 47, 3: 9

A strategy to minimize envy is to allocate items based on the highest relative value to each agent. Let's evaluate:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Prefers items 1 (82), 0 (78), 3 (75), 2 (26) in descending order of value.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prefers items 2 (47), 0 (26), 3 (9), 1 (3) in descending order of value.

Let's try to allocate items to maximize the perceived value for both agents:

- **Allocate item 1** to Agent 0 because it's their highest valued item.
- **Allocate item 2** to Agent 1 as it's their highest valued item.
- **Allocate item 0** to Agent 0 since it's their second-highest valued item and also highly valued by Agent 1, causing potential envy if not allocated to Agent 0.
- **Allocate item 3** to Agent 1 as it balances the allocation and it's the least valued item for Agent 0.

This allocation gives each agent two items, aiming to minimize envy based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
