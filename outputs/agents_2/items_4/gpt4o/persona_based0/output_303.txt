Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  50  44  88  94
1  52  61  96  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 50, and Agent 1 values it at 52.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 44, and Agent 1 values it at 61.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 88, and Agent 1 values it at 96.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 94, and Agent 1 values it at 81.

2. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Total valuation = 50 + 44 + 88 + 94 = 276
   - Agent 1: Total valuation = 52 + 61 + 96 + 81 = 290

3. **Consider Envy-Free Allocation:**
   - We aim to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy, where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Let's allocate items based on maximizing the minimum value each agent receives:
     - Assign Item 3 (highest value for Agent 0) to Agent 0.
     - Assign Item 2 (highest value for Agent 1) to Agent 1.
     - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0).
     - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it less, but it's the only item left).

5. **Check Allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 3], Total value = 44 + 94 = 138
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 2], Total value = 52 + 96 = 148

This allocation minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items with a fair distribution.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
