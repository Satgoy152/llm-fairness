Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  90  35  83
1  11   8  28  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should prefer their own allocation to that of the other agent.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 95
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 35
  - Item 3: 83

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 8
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 76

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we will try to allocate items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their own utility while ensuring they do not envy the other agent.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Assign Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 0, as they value these items the highest.
- Assign Item 2 and Item 3 to Agent 1, as Item 3 has a high value for them and Item 2 adds to their total valuation.

Let's check the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1:
  - Total valuation: 95 (Item 0) + 90 (Item 1) = 185

- Agent 1 receives Items 2 and 3:
  - Total valuation: 28 (Item 2) + 76 (Item 3) = 104

This allocation is envy-free as:

- Agent 0 prefers their allocation (valuation 185) over Agent 1's allocation (valuation of Items 2 and 3, which would be 35 + 83 = 118 for them).
- Agent 1 prefers their allocation (valuation 104) over Agent 0's allocation (valuation of Items 0 and 1, which would be 11 + 8 = 19 for them).

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
