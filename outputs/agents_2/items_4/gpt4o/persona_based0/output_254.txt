Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  17  93   8  53
1  77  49  22  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, if possible, meaning that each agent feels they have received the best possible allocation given their preferences.

First, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0: 17, Item 1: 93, Item 2: 8, Item 3: 53
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0: 77, Item 1: 49, Item 2: 22, Item 3: 57

To find a fair division, we can use the following approach:

1. **Highest Valuation Allocation**: Each agent receives the item for which they have the highest valuation, provided it isn't assigned to another agent with a higher valuation preference for it.

2. **Maximize Total Valuation**: Try to allocate items in such a way that the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) is maximized while ensuring fairness.

Applying these principles:
- Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (93), and Agent 1 values Item 0 the highest (77).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 and Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Next highest for Agent 0 is Item 3 (53), and for Agent 1 is Item 3 (57).
- Since Agent 1 values Item 3 higher, assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
- The remaining item, Item 2, goes to Agent 0.

Allocations:
- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 3.

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Total valuation = 93 (Item 1) + 8 (Item 2) = 101
- Agent 1: Total valuation = 77 (Item 0) + 57 (Item 3) = 134

The allocation is envy-free because each agent receives items such that they wouldn't prefer the allocation of the other agent given their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
