Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3
0  57  62  30  74
1  46  32  23  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value = 57 + 62 + 30 + 74 = 223
- Agent 1's total value = 46 + 32 + 23 + 40 = 141

Given these valuations, we can try to allocate items to minimize envy:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**  
   - For Agent 0, the highest values are on Item 3 (74) and Item 1 (62).
   - For Agent 1, the highest values are on Item 0 (46) and Item 3 (40).

2. **Allocate items based on preference and try to balance perceived fairness:**
   - Give Agent 0 the items they value the highest: Item 3 (74) and Item 1 (62).
   - Give Agent 1 the items they value next highest: Item 0 (46).

3. **Allocate remaining items to ensure all items are distributed:**
   - The remaining item is Item 2. Agent 0 values it at 30, while Agent 1 values it at 23. To balance the total perceived value, give Item 2 to Agent 0.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Item 0.

This allocation tries to balance the total value each agent perceives, considering their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0]
}
```
