Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  20  61  65
1  77  37  21   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that each agent feels that their share is at least as valuable as any other agent's share or, ideally, their most preferred. This is a challenging problem, especially when dealing with integer allocations and a small number of items. 

Given the valuations:
- Agent 0 values: [58, 20, 61, 65]
- Agent 1 values: [77, 37, 21, 8]

We need to allocate the items such that no agent envies the other based on their valuations.

To achieve a fair division:
1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 2, and 3.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 0 and 1.

Let's try to make allocations:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 since it is the highest valued item for Agent 1.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since it is highly valued for Agent 0 and less valued for Agent 1.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since it is the second highest valued item for Agent 1.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 since it is the next highest valued for Agent 0 and least valued for Agent 1.

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

This distribution tries to minimize envy since each agent gets items that are highly valued to them relative to what the other agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
