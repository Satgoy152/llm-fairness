Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  22   0  99  63
1  26  61  19  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, given their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0: 22, Item 1: 0, Item 2: 99, Item 3: 63
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0: 26, Item 1: 61, Item 2: 19, Item 3: 23

Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

One possible approach is to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive while ensuring that each agent is not envious of the other's allocation.

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 2 (99) and Item 3 (63).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for Item 1 (61) and Item 0 (26).

Given these observations, a fair allocation can be:

- Assign Item 2 and Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that:

- Agent 0 receives items with their highest valuations (99 and 63).
- Agent 1 receives items with their highest valuations (61 and 26).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items that maximize their utility based on their own valuations, and thus, it is envy-free.
