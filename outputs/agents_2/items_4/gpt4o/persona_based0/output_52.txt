Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  16  44  60  73
1  63  26  26  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or attempting to achieve envy-freeness. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [16, 44, 60, 73]
- Agent 1 values: [63, 26, 26, 92]

Let's analyze potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0 receives item 3; Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, 2:**
   - Agent 0 gets value: 73
   - Agent 1 gets value: 63 + 26 + 26 = 115

2. **Agent 0 receives items 2, 3; Agent 1 receives items 0, 1:**
   - Agent 0 gets value: 60 + 73 = 133
   - Agent 1 gets value: 63 + 26 = 89

3. **Agent 0 receives items 1, 3; Agent 1 receives items 0, 2:**
   - Agent 0 gets value: 44 + 73 = 117
   - Agent 1 gets value: 63 + 26 = 89

4. **Agent 0 receives items 0, 3; Agent 1 receives items 1, 2:**
   - Agent 0 gets value: 16 + 73 = 89
   - Agent 1 gets value: 26 + 26 = 52

Among these allocations, Option 2 seems to provide the highest utility for both agents while keeping the distribution relatively balanced. This allocation minimizes envy since each agent receives a substantial part of their total valuation.

Therefore, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
