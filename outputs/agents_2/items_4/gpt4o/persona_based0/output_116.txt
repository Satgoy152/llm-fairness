Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  19  20  53
1  77  74  21  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their individual valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 20
  - Item 3: 53

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 53

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance the perceived value for each agent:

1. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 places the highest value (77) on item 0, which is their most valued item.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 places the second highest value (74) on item 1. Allocating this item to Agent 1 maximizes their overall satisfaction.

3. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 places a higher value (20) on item 2 compared to Agent 1 (21), and this allocation helps balance the overall perceived value.

4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 3 (53). Allocating this to Agent 0 ensures they receive significant value.

This allocation gives each agent a total perceived value as follows:

- Agent 0: Value of items 2 and 3 = 20 + 53 = 73
- Agent 1: Value of items 0 and 1 = 77 + 74 = 151

While this allocation might not be perfectly envy-free due to the different total valuations, it attempts to balance the distribution based on each agent's preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
