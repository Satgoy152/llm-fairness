Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3
0  75  62  93  77
1  49   6   0  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness and attempt to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. Here's how we can approach this problem:

First, let's compare the valuations of each item between the two agents:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 75, Agent 1 values it at 49.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 values it at 6.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 93, Agent 1 values it at 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 77, Agent 1 values it at 37.

Agent 0 generally values items much higher than Agent 1. To achieve a fair division, we should strive to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because Agent 1 values it at 0, so it should not cause any envy.
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 as they have the highest valuation for it.
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 because Agent 0 already has two high-value items, and this will help balance the total valuation.
4. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 as Agent 0 has already received two items with high valuations, and this minimizes the envy for Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, both agents receive two items each. Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3. This allocation aims to balance the total satisfaction while maintaining fairness as much as possible given the high disparity in valuations.
