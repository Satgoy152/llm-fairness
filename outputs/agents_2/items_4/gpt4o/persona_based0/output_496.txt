Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  37  41  62   0
1  37  17   5  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0: 37, Item 1: 41, Item 2: 62, Item 3: 0
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0: 37, Item 1: 17, Item 2: 5, Item 3: 59

A potential allocation strategy is to try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that the distribution is fair.

Let's evaluate the items:

- Item 0 is valued equally by both agents (37).
- Item 1 is more valued by Agent 0 (41) compared to Agent 1 (17).
- Item 2 is significantly more valued by Agent 0 (62) than Agent 1 (5).
- Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 1 (59), while Agent 0 values it at 0.

An allocation that balances these valuations could be:

- Allocate Items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Items 2 and 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation considers that Agent 0 gets higher value items where they show a strong preference, while Agent 1 gets the item they value the most (Item 3) along with an additional item (Item 2).

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
