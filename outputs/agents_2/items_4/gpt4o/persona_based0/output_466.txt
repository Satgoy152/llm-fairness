Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  60  55  13
1  64   9  60  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1 60 55 13]
 [64  9 60 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their valuation, while keeping the allocation envy-free if possible.

### Valuations Table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 1      | 60     | 55     | 13     |
| 1     | 64     | 9      | 60     | 32     |

### Approach

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (60)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (55)
   - Third highest: Item 3 (13)
   - Lowest: Item 0 (1)

2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (64)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (60)
   - Third highest: Item 3 (32)
   - Lowest: Item 1 (9)

### Allocation Strategy

We aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and utilizes each agent's highest valuations:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Item 1 (most valued by Agent 0)
  - Item 3 (next best option)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0 (most valued by Agent 1)
  - Item 2 (second most valued by Agent 1)

### Final Allocations:

The allocations ensure that each agent receives items that are highly valued by them:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
``` 

This allocation is designed to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences, given the constraints.
