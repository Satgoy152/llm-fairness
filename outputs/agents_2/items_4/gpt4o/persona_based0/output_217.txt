Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  20  97  11
1  16  92  86  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy. Since there are only two agents, we can utilize the envy-free criterion by ensuring that both agents feel they have received a fair share of the items.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 21 + 20 + 97 + 11 = 149
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 16 + 92 + 86 + 17 = 211

2. **Fair Share Calculation:**
   - Agent 0's fair share: 149 / 2 = 74.5
   - Agent 1's fair share: 211 / 2 = 105.5

3. **Initial Allocation for Envy-Free Criterion:**
   - We aim to allocate items so that each agent's total valuation is as close as possible to their fair share.

4. **Item Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (97 is the highest single valuation for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (92 is the highest single valuation for Agent 1).
   - Remaining items: 0, 3.

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - For item 0: 
     - Agent 0 values it at 21, and Agent 1 values it at 16. It's slightly better for Agent 0.
   - For item 3:
     - Agent 0 values it at 11, and Agent 1 values it at 17. It's better for Agent 1.
  
6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation should be envy-free given the constraints and the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
