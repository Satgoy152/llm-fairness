Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  35  16  14  57
1  96  40  89  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35 16 14 57]
 [96 40 89 85]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim to achieve an envy-free division if possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of the other agent based on their valuations.

Here's the valuation table for clarity:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 35 | 16 | 14 | 57 |
| 1          | 96 | 40 | 89 | 85 |

Calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 35 + 16 + 14 + 57 = 122
- Agent 1: 96 + 40 + 89 + 85 = 310

To achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 57, while Agent 1 values it at 85. Giving this to Agent 0 helps balance their allocation.

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 96, while Agent 0 values it at 35. Assigning this to Agent 1 ensures they receive a high-value item.

3. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values this item at 40 while Agent 0 values it at 16. Giving it to Agent 1 helps balance their allocation.

4. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values this item at 14, while Agent 1 values it at 89. However, since Agent 1 already has two items with significant value, Agent 0 can take this item to maintain fairness.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2 and 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 0 and 1

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences and attempts to balance the total value they receive.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
