Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  66  33  87
1  35  90  95   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer to have the allocation of the other agent, based on their own valuations.

Here are the valuations given:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 66
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 87

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 95
  - Item 3: 5

To find an envy-free allocation, we can start by looking at the highest-valued items for each agent and attempt to distribute them so that each agent's allocation is maximized for their own values.

1. **Assign Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 87 while Agent 1 values it only at 5. It makes sense to allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Assign Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 95, whereas Agent 0 values it at 33. Therefore, allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Assign Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 66 and Agent 1 values it at 90. To balance the allocation, assign item 1 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 already received a high-valued item 2.

4. **Assign Item 0**:
   - Now, the remaining item is item 0, which Agent 0 values at 49 and Agent 1 at 35. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation method strives to ensure that each agent receives items that are most valuable to them, reducing the likelihood of envy.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
