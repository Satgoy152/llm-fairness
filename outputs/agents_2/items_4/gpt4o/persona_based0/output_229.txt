Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  13  13  75
1  64  40  65  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[87 13 13 75]
 [64 40 65 90]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can consider the concept of envy-freeness, which means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation given to the other agent, according to their own valuations.

Given the valuation matrix:
```
    0   1   2   3
0  87  13  13  75
1  64  40  65  90
```

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 0 (87), 1 (13), 2 (13), 3 (75)
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 0 (64), 1 (40), 2 (65), 3 (90)

To achieve envy-freeness, we should ensure that both agents get items that they value highly. 

One possible allocation could be:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because they value it the highest (87), and it's also the second highest value for Agent 1 (64), making it a strategic choice for Agent 0.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 because they value it the highest (90), and Agent 0 values it (75) second highest after item 0.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because they value it (65), which is higher than Agent 0's valuation (13).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 because they value it (13), and it's the next available item.

This allocation ensures that:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, with a total valuation of 87 + 13 = 100.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 2, with a total valuation of 90 + 65 = 155.

Both agents get valuable items according to their own valuations, and the allocation is envy-free because neither agent would prefer to swap their allocation with the other.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 2]
}
```
