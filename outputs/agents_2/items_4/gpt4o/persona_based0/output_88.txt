Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3
0  50  93  47  40
1  90  45  77  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items such that there is no envy between them, if possible. Envy-freeness is often a challenging goal, but we can try to approximate it by maximizing each agent's valuation of their assigned items.

Let's first look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 50
  - Item 1: 93
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 40

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 45
  - Item 2: 77
  - Item 3: 98

A straightforward way to allocate items is to look for an allocation that maximizes each agent's total valuation of their items, while also minimizing envy. Let's start by assigning the items:

1. **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 0 (93) compared to Agent 1 (45).
2. **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 1 (90) compared to Agent 0 (50).
3. **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 1 (98) compared to Agent 0 (40).
4. **Item 2** is most valued by Agent 1 (77) compared to Agent 0 (47).

Given this analysis, a potential allocation is:

- Assign **Item 1** to Agent 0.
- Assign **Items 0, 2, and 3** to Agent 1.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (value 93)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, and 3 (value 90 + 77 + 98 = 265)

This distribution maximizes the sum of valuations for Agent 1 while ensuring Agent 0 receives their highest valued item. 

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
