Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  10  45  28  71
1  55  74  74  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an envy-free allocation where possible. An envy-free allocation means that each agent feels they received at least as much value as the other agent did with their respective allocations.

Here's a breakdown of the total valuation each agent has over all items:

- Agent 0: 10 + 45 + 28 + 71 = 154
- Agent 1: 55 + 74 + 74 + 93 = 296

Now, let's consider the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 3 the highest (71), followed by item 1 (45), item 2 (28), and item 0 (10).
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 3 the highest (93), followed by item 1 and item 2 (both 74), and item 0 (55).

To start, we can allocate the highest valued item for each agent:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, the item they value at 93.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, the item they value at 45.

This initial allocation helps in addressing the highest preference for each agent. Now, we have items 0 and 2 left to allocate:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1. This is because Agent 1 values item 0 more than Agent 0 does (55 vs. 10).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0. This balances the allocation by giving Agent 0 an item they value at 28.

Let's check the total value each agent receives from the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2], with a total value of 45 + 28 = 73.
- Agent 1 receives items [3, 0], with a total value of 93 + 55 = 148.

Though the allocation is not envy-free (Agent 0 might envy Agent 1â€™s allocation), it ensures that each agent receives items they value, while respecting the integer allocation requirement.

Here is the allocation in the requested json format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 0]
}
```
