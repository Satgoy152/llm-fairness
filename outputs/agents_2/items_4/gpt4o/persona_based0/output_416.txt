Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  12  87  59
1  19  76  94   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a manner that ensures envy-freeness, we will use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation based on their preferences while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuation matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 73     | 12     | 87     | 59     |
| 1     | 19     | 76     | 94     | 9      |

1. **Agent 0's preferences in descending order**: Item 2 (87), Item 0 (73), Item 3 (59), Item 1 (12)
2. **Agent 1's preferences in descending order**: Item 2 (94), Item 1 (76), Item 0 (19), Item 3 (9)

#### Allocation Strategy:
- **Item 2**: It has the highest valuation for both agents, but Agent 1 values it more (94 vs. 87). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Item 0**: It is the next highest valued item for Agent 0 (73) and has a lower value for Agent 1 (19). Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: It is highly valued by Agent 1 (76) and less by Agent 0 (12). Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: It has a moderate value for Agent 0 (59) and low for Agent 1 (9). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

#### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

This allocation gives each agent their most preferred items based on what is available and ensures the items are allocated fairly by maximizing each agent's total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
