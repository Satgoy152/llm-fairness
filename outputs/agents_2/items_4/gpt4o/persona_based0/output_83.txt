Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3
0  74  35  58  75
1  45  36  57  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle with a similar total valuation, making the division as envy-free as possible.

Let's sum up the values that each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 58
  - Item 3: 75
  - Total: 74 + 35 + 58 + 75 = 242

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 45
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 57
  - Item 3: 11
  - Total: 45 + 36 + 57 + 11 = 149

The aim is to allocate the items such that both agents get a similar total value. We can use a simple heuristic based on maximizing the minimum value each agent receives to achieve a fair division.

Let's try assigning the items to balance the total valuation:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (highest value for both agents, but significantly higher for Agent 0).
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (Agent 1 values it quite highly).
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 values it significantly more).
4. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (remaining item).

Now, let's check the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Items: 0, 3
  - Total Value: 74 (Item 0) + 75 (Item 3) = 149

- Agent 1:
  - Items: 2, 1
  - Total Value: 57 (Item 2) + 36 (Item 1) = 93

While the absolute values aren't equal, this allocation respects the preference order and attempts to balance based on the highest values each agent places on specific items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy considering the valuations provided.
