Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  70  64  66  43
1  61   1  76  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In this problem, we aim to allocate the four items among the two agents such that the allocation is fair and envy-free. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent.

To achieve this, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Calculate the total valuation for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0 values the items as follows: [70, 64, 66, 43]
   - Agent 1 values the items as follows: [61, 1, 76, 69]

2. **Sum the total value each agent assigns to all items**:
   - Total value for Agent 0 = 70 + 64 + 66 + 43 = 243
   - Total value for Agent 1 = 61 + 1 + 76 + 69 = 207

3. **Allocate the items in a way that attempts to balance the value each agent receives**.

4. **Trial allocation**: 
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 values it the most)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (as Agent 1 values it the most)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it significantly more than Agent 1)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (as it helps balance the total valuation between the agents)

5. **Calculate total valuation for each agent after allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items [0, 1], total value = 70 + 64 = 134
   - Agent 1 receives items [2, 3], total value = 76 + 69 = 145

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value of the items between the two agents and ensures no agent envies the other's allocation based on their own valuations.

Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
