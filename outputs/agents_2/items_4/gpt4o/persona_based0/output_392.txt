Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3
0  45  15  47  26
1  83  74  24  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can utilize the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation of their allocated items. Given the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [45, 15, 47, 26]
Agent 1: [83, 74, 24, 18]
```

We aim to allocate all four items to the two agents such that the allocations are as fair and envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness implies that no agent would prefer the allocation of items given to the other agent over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (47) and item 0 (45).
- **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (83) and item 1 (74).

To minimize envy, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Item 2 (valuation 47)
   - Item 3 (valuation 26)

   This gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 47 + 26 = 73.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Item 0 (valuation 83)
   - Item 1 (valuation 74)

   This gives Agent 1 a total valuation of 83 + 74 = 157.

This allocation ensures that each agent maximizes their preference based on their valuations and helps achieve a fair distribution. Agent 0 receives the item they value most (item 2), and Agent 1 receives the item they value most (item 0).

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a number of items that reflects their valuations, aiming to achieve fairness and minimize envy.
