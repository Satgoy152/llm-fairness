Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3
0  80  21  73  84
1   4  91  33  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 4 items to the 2 agents such that the allocation is fair, ideally aiming for an envy-free solution if possible. Envy-freeness means no agent should prefer the bundle of items that another agent receives over their own bundle, based on their valuation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:  
  - Item 0: 80  
  - Item 1: 21  
  - Item 2: 73  
  - Item 3: 84  

- Agent 1 values:  
  - Item 0: 4  
  - Item 1: 91  
  - Item 2: 33  
  - Item 3: 74  

We will try to allocate the items such that each agent gets a bundle of items they value highly and, ideally, each agent feels they have received a fair share.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: Agent 0 values items 3, 0, and 2 the most highly.
2. **Agent 1's Preferences**: Agent 1 values items 1, 3, and 2 the most highly.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can analyze the valued items and try to split them so that no agent envies the other's allocation. We should aim to give each agent at least one of their top-valued items.

#### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 2
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 80 (item 0) + 73 (item 2) = 153
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 4 (item 0) + 33 (item 2) = 37

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1 and 3
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: 21 (item 1) + 84 (item 3) = 105
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: 91 (item 1) + 74 (item 3) = 165

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived fairness by allowing each agent to receive items that have high value for them compared to the other agent. Agent 1 receives their most valued item, and Agent 0 receives two items they highly value.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
