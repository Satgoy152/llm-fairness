Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  83  16  60
1  68  17  44  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they received their fair share based on their valuations. Given the valuations, we will aim to distribute the items in such a way that both agents feel satisfied with their allocation.

Here is the valuation matrix:
```
Agent 0: [26, 83, 16, 60]
Agent 1: [68, 17, 44, 64]
```

We aim to allocate all 4 items in a way that minimizes envy. To do this, let's consider the following steps:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 significantly higher than Agent 1 does (83 vs. 17). Allocating item 1 to Agent 0 would minimize envy.
2. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 higher than Agent 0 does (68 vs. 26). Allocating item 0 to Agent 1 would minimize envy.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values item 2 higher than Agent 0 (44 vs. 16). Allocating item 2 to Agent 1 would minimize envy.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 slightly less than Agent 1 (60 vs. 64), but since Agent 1 already has two items, giving item 3 to Agent 0 balances the allocation.

With this allocation, each agent receives 2 items, and we aim to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation aims to satisfy both agents based on their perceived values of the items, reducing the likelihood of envy.

The fair allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
