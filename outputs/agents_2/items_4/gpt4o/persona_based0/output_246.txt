Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  93  84  84
1   9  26  95  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to focus on achieving an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 76     | 93     | 84     | 84     |
| 1     | 9      | 26     | 95     | 14     |

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value items: Item 1 (93), Item 2 (84), Item 3 (84)
   - Agent 0's preference order: Item 1, Item 2, Item 3, Item 0

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest value items: Item 2 (95), Item 1 (26), Item 3 (14), Item 0 (9)
   - Agent 1's preference order: Item 2, Item 1, Item 3, Item 0

A potential fair allocation can be designed around the highest valuation items for each agent while avoiding conflicts over the same item, especially the highest valued ones.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:** This item is highly valued by Agent 0 and less by Agent 1.
- **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:** This is the most valued item by Agent 1 and fairly high for Agent 0 but crucial for Agent 1.
- **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:** This fits better with Agent 0, given their higher valuation compared to Agent 1.
- **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1:** The remaining item goes to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to balance the high-value preferences while ensuring each agent gets items they highly value.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives both agents items they highly value, striving to minimize envy and create a balanced distribution based on their preferences.
