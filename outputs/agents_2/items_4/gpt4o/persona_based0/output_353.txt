Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  82  19  23
1  69  50   7  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that attempts to ensure envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to make sure each agent perceives their allocation as fair compared to the others.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (89), Item 1 (82), Item 2 (19), Item 3 (23)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (69), Item 1 (50), Item 2 (7), Item 3 (61)

To achieve a fair allocation, we can start by assigning items that have the highest value to each agent, ensuring that both agents feel they are receiving significant value. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for Agent 0 and is significantly more valuable to Agent 0 than to Agent 1.
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as it has the highest value for Agent 1 compared to the other items.
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as it has a high value for Agent 0 and is more valuable to Agent 0 than to Agent 1.
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as it is the remaining item and gives Agent 1 a complete share of two items.

This allocation attempts to balance the total value that each agent receives, considering their individual valuations.

The allocations in the requested JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 2]
}
```
