Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  91  91  19
1  34  47  19  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1), we want to consider the concept of envy-freeness and try to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their own valuations.

Let's first compute the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 91
  - Item 3: 19
  - Total valuation: 49 + 91 + 91 + 19 = 250

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 47
  - Item 2: 19
  - Item 3: 35
  - Total valuation: 34 + 47 + 19 + 35 = 135

To achieve a fair allocation, we might aim to distribute items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total value according to their own valuation.

Let's try the following allocation strategy:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it has a high valuation (91) for them.
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 as well, as it equally has a high valuation (91) for them.
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it has a higher relative value to Agent 1 compared to the other items.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, given that it holds some value (35) for them.

Let's evaluate this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items [1, 2] with a total valuation of 91 + 91 = 182.
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 3] with a total valuation of 34 + 35 = 69.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive a share that reflects their strong preferences for certain items, minimizing envy because both agents are receiving their highest valued items within the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
