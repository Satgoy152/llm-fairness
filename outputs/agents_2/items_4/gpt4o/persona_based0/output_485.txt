Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  50  13  48
1  16  44  43  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [16 44 43 91]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and aim to minimize envy. Envy-freeness in this context means ensuring that each agent feels they received at least as much value as the other agent, given their own valuations.

Let's look at the valuation matrix first:

- Agent 0 valuations: [8, 50, 13, 48]
- Agent 1 valuations: [16, 44, 43, 91]

We aim to distribute the items to maximize the perceived value for each agent while ensuring fairness.

A reasonable approach is to consider the highest valued items for each agent first and try to balance the overall value each agent receives.

### Allocation Plan:

1. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values it highest at 91.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it highest at 50.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 43 and has the next highest value after item 3.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 0**:
   - This is the remaining item. Agent 0 values it at 8, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 16.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with a balanced distribution of high-value items as perceived by each agent.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the total value as they perceive it, aiming to minimize envy between the agents.
