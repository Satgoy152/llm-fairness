Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0   9  64  51  94
1  82  34  51  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that envy-freeness is as close as possible, we need to consider each agentâ€™s valuation for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share, minimizing any potential envy. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: 9, 64, 51, 94
- Agent 1: 82, 34, 51, 56

First, let's assess which items each agent values most:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (94), followed by item 1 (64).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (82), followed by item 2 (51).

A strategy for fair allocation is to give each agent their highest-valued item, then allocate the remaining items in a way that maintains balance. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it is their most valued item.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it is their most valued item.

Now, the remaining items are 1 and 2. We need to allocate them to maintain fairness:

- For item 1, Agent 0 values it at 64, and Agent 1 values it at 34. Agent 0 values it more, so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- For item 2, both agents value it equally at 51. To maintain balance, assign item 2 to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives their most valued available items while trying to minimize envy. Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
