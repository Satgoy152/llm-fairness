Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  26   7  93
1  31  77  38  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents while attempting to ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and aim for an allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 76
  - Item 1: 26
  - Item 2: 7
  - Item 3: 93

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 38
  - Item 3: 12

We can approach this problem using a method known as the "maximum envy-free" allocation. However, given the limited number of agents and items, we may focus on ensuring that the allocations maximize each agent's perceived value.

A reasonable approach to start with is to allocate the most valued item for each agent and then attempt to balance the remaining items.

1. **Allocate the highest valued items to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for Item 3 (93).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 1 (77).

2. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - The next highest valuation for Agent 0 is Item 0 (76), which is also the second-highest overall valuation.
   - Agent 1's next highest valuation is Item 2 (38).

Let's finalize the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 0
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 2

These allocations ensure that each agent receives items they highly value, potentially minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
