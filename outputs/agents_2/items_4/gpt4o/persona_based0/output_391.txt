Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3
0  16  92  73  28
1  44  99  11  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an envy-free allocation, if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle, according to their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 16  
  - Item 1: 92  
  - Item 2: 73  
  - Item 3: 28  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 44  
  - Item 1: 99  
  - Item 2: 11  
  - Item 3: 60  

A common approach is to start by allocating the item each agent values the most, and then adjust to ensure all items are allocated while considering envy-freeness.

1. **Agent 0's highest valued item**: Item 1 (92)
2. **Agent 1's highest valued item**: Item 1 (99)

Since both agents highly value Item 1, we need to balance this allocation to achieve fairness:

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it more (99 vs. 92).

Now proceed with the remaining items:

- **Agent 0's next highest valued item**: Item 2 (73)
- **Agent 1's next highest valued item**: Item 3 (60)

Allocate based on these:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

Now, only Item 0 is left:

- **Agent 0** values Item 0 at 16.
- **Agent 1** values Item 0 at 44.

Allocate the remaining item:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it more.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, and 0

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences as much as possible while allocating all items. The allocation is not perfectly envy-free because Agent 0 might prefer the bundle of Agent 1 due to the high value of Item 1, but it is balanced given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3, 0]
}
```
