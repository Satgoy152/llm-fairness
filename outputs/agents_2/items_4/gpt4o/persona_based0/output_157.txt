Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3
0  50  93  47  93
1  43  56  77  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents in a way that respects their valuations and attempts to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider the value each agent places on each item. We aim to distribute the items so that each agent feels they received a fair share, minimizing envy. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: \(50 + 93 + 47 + 93 = 283\)
   - Agent 1's total valuation: \(43 + 56 + 77 + 65 = 241\)

2. **Fair Share Calculation:**
   - For Agent 0, a fair division would be around half of their total valuation, which is \(283 / 2 = 141.5\).
   - For Agent 1, a fair division would be around half of their total valuation, which is \(241 / 2 = 120.5\).

3. **Initial Allocation Based on High Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 values items 1 and 3 very highly, both at 93.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 highly at 77.

4. **Allocate Items:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

5. **Remaining Item Allocation:**
   - The remaining item is 0. 
   - Agent 0's total valuation with items 1 and 3 is \(93 + 93 = 186\).
   - Agent 1's current total valuation with item 2 is 77. 
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

The allocation results in Agent 0 having a total valuation of \(93 + 93 = 186\) and Agent 1 having a total valuation of \(43 + 77 = 120\). This distribution is close to the fair share for each agent and minimizes potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
