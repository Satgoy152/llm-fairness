Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  52  49  73
1  53  11   2  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can utilize the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation per Agent**: Assess the total value each agent places on all items.
   - Agent 0 Total Value: \(32 + 52 + 49 + 73 = 206\)
   - Agent 1 Total Value: \(53 + 11 + 2 + 97 = 163\)

2. **Identify Highest Value Items per Agent**: Each agent will have a preference order for the items based on their valuations. We can assign items to maximize their perceived value.

3. **Initial Allocation**: Begin by checking the highest valued item for each agent and make allocations ensuring that each agent receives items that maximize their utility without causing envy.

4. **Check and Adjust for Envy-freeness**: After initial allocation, ensure that no agent would prefer to swap their allocation with another agent. If such a situation exists, adjust the allocations accordingly.

### Allocation Strategy

Given the valuations:
- **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the most.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the most as well.

Since both agents highly value item 3, we need to ensure fairness in distribution:

- **Assign item 3 to Agent 1**: This is because Agent 1 values item 3 the most (97) compared to any other item.

- **Assign items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 0**: This distributes the remaining items to Agent 0, maximizing their total value from the remaining items.

### Verification of Envy-freeness

- **Agent 0** has items 0, 1, and 2 with a total valuation of \(32 + 52 + 49 = 133\).
- **Agent 1** has item 3 with a valuation of 97.

This allocation is fair because:
- Agent 0 would not prefer Agent 1's allocation since their total from their allocated items is higher.
- Agent 1 receives the item which they value the most.

Thus, the final allocation ensures each agent receives the best possible outcome based on their preferences without causing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3]
}
```
