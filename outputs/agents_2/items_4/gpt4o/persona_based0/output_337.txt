Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  63  38  36  61
1  83  95  12  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents (0 and 1), we aim to achieve envy-freeness, which means each agent should feel that they received a bundle of items that is at least as good as what the other agent received, based on their own valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as: 
  - Item 0: 63
  - Item 1: 38
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 61

- Agent 1 values the items as:
  - Item 0: 83
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 90

Given these valuations, let's determine a fair allocation:

One potential allocation is:
- Allocate Item 1 and Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 0.

Verification:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, which they value at 63 + 36 = 99.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3, which they value at 95 + 90 = 185.

Agent 0 values their allocation at 99 and Agent 1 values theirs at 185, which is fair from their own perspectives given the valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
