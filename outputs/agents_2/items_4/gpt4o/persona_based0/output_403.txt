Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  28  60  82
1  10  97  18  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

```
Agent \ Item | 0   1   2   3
----------------------------
Agent 0     | 1  28  60  82
Agent 1     | 10  97  18  21
```

We need to allocate items such that each agent feels they received a fair share in terms of their own valuation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1 (High Valuation on Item 1):**
   - Agent 1 values item 1 significantly higher than Agent 0 (97 vs. 28). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 0 (High Valuation on Items 2 and 3):**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (82), followed by item 2 (60). Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 2 is still available. Agent 0 values it more (60) than Agent 1 (18), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Item 0 is left. Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0 (10 vs. 1), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

### Resulting Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing envy between agents.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
