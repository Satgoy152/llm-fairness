Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  17  81  31  89
1   9  12  76  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and striving for envy-freeness, let's analyze the situation:

### Agent Valuations:
- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 17
  - Item 1: 81
  - Item 2: 31
  - Item 3: 89

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 12
  - Item 2: 76
  - Item 3: 91

### Analysis:
1. **Agent Preferences**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest (89), followed by Item 1 (81).
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 the highest (91), followed by Item 2 (76).

2. **Potential Allocations**:
   - Since both agents value Item 3 the highest, it is crucial to allocate it to ensure envy-freeness.
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 highly, while Agent 1 values Item 2 highly.

3. **Envy-Free Consideration**:
   - We will try to allocate items in a way that minimizes the envy between agents.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 3]
  - Agent 0 gets Item 1 (value 81) and Item 3 (value 89).
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 2]
  - Agent 1 gets Item 0 (value 9) and Item 2 (value 76).

### Allocation Justification:
- Agent 0 receives their two highest valued items.
- Agent 1 receives their second highest valued item (Item 2) and the remaining item.
- Both agents have at least one item they highly value, reducing potential envy.

Given these considerations, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
