Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  62  91  70
1  68  40  77  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution that is envy-free to the best extent possible given the integer constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent more than their own. However, with integer constraints and a small number of items, perfect envy-freeness might not always be achievable.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0 at 97
  - Item 1 at 62
  - Item 2 at 91
  - Item 3 at 70

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0 at 68
  - Item 1 at 40
  - Item 2 at 77
  - Item 3 at 53

We will try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 0 (97) and Item 2 (91).
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for Item 2 (77) but not higher than Agent 0's. However, Agent 1 has the highest valuation for Item 3 (53 compared to 70 of Agent 0 but better than their own other preferences).

Given this, a reasonable allocation can be:

- Assign **Item 0** and **Item 2** to **Agent 0**. This maximizes Agent 0's total value from their perspective (97 + 91).
- Assign **Item 1** and **Item 3** to **Agent 1**. This provides Agent 1 with the items where they have relatively higher valuations (40 + 53).

This allocation results in relatively balanced satisfaction based on the initial valuations and ensures each agent gets two items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
