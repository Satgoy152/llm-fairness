Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3
0  26  66  21  59
1  16  82  37  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we want to allocate the items to the agents in a way that maximizes fairness and, ideally, minimizes envy. In this context, we will consider an allocation where each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as they value the bundle assigned to the other agent.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [26, 66, 21, 59]
- Agent 1's valuations: [16, 82, 37, 30]

We have 2 agents and 4 items, which means each agent should ideally receive 2 items. We will look for an allocation where each agent's total valuation is maximized for their own assigned items.

### Possible Allocations:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.
   - Valuations:
     - Agent 0: 26 + 59 = 85
     - Agent 1: 82 + 37 = 119

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.
   - Valuations:
     - Agent 0: 66 + 21 = 87
     - Agent 1: 16 + 30 = 46

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
   - Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3.
   - Valuations:
     - Agent 0: 26 + 21 = 47
     - Agent 1: 82 + 30 = 112

4. **Allocation 4:**
   - Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.
   - Valuations:
     - Agent 0: 66 + 59 = 125
     - Agent 1: 16 + 37 = 53

### Envy-Free Consideration:

- Allocation 1: Agent 0 might envy Agent 1 because 119 > 85.
- Allocation 2: Agent 1 might envy Agent 0 because 87 > 46.
- Allocation 3: Agent 0 might envy Agent 1 because 112 > 47.
- Allocation 4: Agent 1 might envy Agent 0 because 125 > 53.

### Selection:

From these options, Allocation 1 appears to be the best choice in terms of minimizing envy, as both agents get a high valuation of their own allocated items compared to some other allocations.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
