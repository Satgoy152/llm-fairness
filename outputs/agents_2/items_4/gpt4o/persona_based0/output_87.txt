Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  16  62  14  83
1  72  53  88  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72 53 88 61]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy between the two agents, we should consider how each agent values the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 16 | 62 | 14 | 83 |
| 1            | 72 | 53 | 88 | 61 |

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0 prefers** Item 3 the most (value of 83), followed by Item 1 (62), Item 0 (16), and finally Item 2 (14).

2. **Agent 1 prefers** Item 2 the most (value of 88), followed by Item 0 (72), Item 1 (53), and finally Item 3 (61).

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 3**: This is highly valued by Agent 0 (83) and less so by Agent 1 (61). Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

- **Item 2**: This is highly valued by Agent 1 (88) and less so by Agent 0 (14). Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item (72) more than Agent 0 (16). Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item (62) more than Agent 1 (53). Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

### Resulting Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.

This allocation aims to satisfy each agent's preferences based on their valuations as much as possible, considering the constraints.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
