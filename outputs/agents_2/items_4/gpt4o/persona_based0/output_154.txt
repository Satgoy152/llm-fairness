Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3
0  13  70  24  58
1  30  29  66  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we should consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, which means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation given to the other agent.

### Valuations Table

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 13     | 70     | 24     | 58     |
| 1     | 30     | 29     | 66     | 84     |

### Steps to Allocate

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 1 (70) and Item 3 (58).
   - Agent 1 highly values Item 3 (84) and Item 2 (66).

2. **Attempt to Assign Items to Minimize Envy:**
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as it is their highest-valued item.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
   - Now, consider the remaining items (Item 0 and Item 2).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0 has received Item 1 (value 70).
   - Agent 1 has received Item 3 (value 84).
   - For the remaining items, we need to consider how to split Item 0 and Item 2.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1; even though Agent 1 values Item 0 less than Item 2, this allocation balances total value, as Agent 1 already has a high-value item (Item 3).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, giving them another item they value moderately.

### Final Allocation

This allocation aims to balance the values so that neither agent feels significantly envious of the other's allocation.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 0]
}
```

In this distribution:
- Agent 0 receives Item 1 and Item 2, which they value at 70 and 24, respectively.
- Agent 1 receives Item 3 and Item 0, which they value at 84 and 30, respectively.

This allocation aims to be as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. Each agent receives items they value significantly, and the overall distribution attempts to balance perceived fairness.
