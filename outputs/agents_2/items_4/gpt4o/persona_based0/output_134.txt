Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  20  72  40  92
1  31  74  56   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we want to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent more than their own bundle.

Let's examine the valuations given:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 20
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 40
  - Item 3: 92

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 31
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 56
  - Item 3: 9

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize the total valuation each agent has for their bundle, ensuring that no agent envies the other. This can be done by evaluating possible allocations and choosing the one which is most balanced in terms of value.

Let's consider a potential allocation:

1. Assign items to maximize each agent's total valuation while keeping the allocation envy-free:

   - Give Agent 0 the items they value more than Agent 1. Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 0 compared to Agent 1.
   - Give Agent 1 the items they value more than Agent 0. Items 1 and 2 are valued more by Agent 1 compared to Agent 0.

Let's start with an allocation that attempts to balance the values:

- Allocate items to Agent 0: [0, 3]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 20 (Item 0) + 92 (Item 3) = 112
- Allocate items to Agent 1: [1, 2]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 74 (Item 1) + 56 (Item 2) = 130

This allocation provides a reasonably balanced total valuation for both agents and attempts to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 receives items with a total value of 112.
- Agent 1 receives items with a total value of 130.

Agent 0 might slightly envy Agent 1 due to the higher total value, but given the constraints of integer items, this allocation is a reasonable compromise.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
