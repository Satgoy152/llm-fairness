Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  74  31  11  72
1   9  73  85  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can use the approach of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Let's analyze the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 31
  - Item 2: 11
  - Item 3: 72

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 9
  - Item 1: 73
  - Item 2: 85
  - Item 3: 99

One approach to achieve a fair division is to use a method that considers both the sum of valuations and tries to distribute high-valued items in a way that minimizes potential envy. Here is a possible allocation:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1: This is their highest-valued item, and it has a very high value of 99 for them.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0: This is their highest-valued item, with a value of 74.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1: This item has a higher valuation for Agent 1 (73) compared to Agent 0 (31).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0: This item has a higher valuation for Agent 1 (85), but Agent 0 already gets their highest-valued item, and this balances the distribution.

This allocation results in the following total valuations:
- Agent 0: 74 (Item 0) + 11 (Item 2) = 85
- Agent 1: 99 (Item 3) + 73 (Item 1) = 172

While this allocation does not result in equal total valuations, it tries to minimize potential envy by ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 1]
}
```
