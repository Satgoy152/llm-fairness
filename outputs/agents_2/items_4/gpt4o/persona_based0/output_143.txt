Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  86  78  13  62
1  50  19  74  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and try to distribute them in a way that minimizes envy. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **List the valuations:**

   - Agent 0:
     - Item 0: 86
     - Item 1: 78
     - Item 2: 13
     - Item 3: 62

   - Agent 1:
     - Item 0: 50
     - Item 1: 19
     - Item 2: 74
     - Item 3: 21

2. **Determine the total valuation for each item across both agents:**

   - Item 0: 86 (Agent 0) + 50 (Agent 1) = 136
   - Item 1: 78 (Agent 0) + 19 (Agent 1) = 97
   - Item 2: 13 (Agent 0) + 74 (Agent 1) = 87
   - Item 3: 62 (Agent 0) + 21 (Agent 1) = 83

3. **Propose an initial allocation strategy:**

   - Assign each agent the items for which they have the highest valuations compared to the other agent.

4. **Allocate items:**

   - Agent 0 values Item 0 the most (86), and Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (74).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1.

5. **Allocate the remaining items:**

   - Now consider the remaining items: Item 1 and Item 3.
   - Agent 0's next highest valuation is Item 1 (78), and Agent 1's next highest valuation is Item 3 (21).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 and Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, reducing potential envy.

6. **Final allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items 0 and 1, and Agent 1 items 2 and 3. Each agent receives two items, and all four items are allocated.
