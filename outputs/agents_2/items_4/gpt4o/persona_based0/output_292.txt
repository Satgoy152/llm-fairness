Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  33  73  95  81
1  19  18  50  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received an equal or fair share based on their own valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [33, 73, 95, 81]
- Agent 1: [19, 18, 50, 61]

A fair division in this context would aim to maximize each agent's total perceived value from the items they receive while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 33 + 73 + 95 + 81 = 282
- Total value for Agent 1: 19 + 18 + 50 + 61 = 148

To ensure envy-freeness, we need to allocate items such that each agent perceives that they are getting at least half of the total value they believe is available (since there are two agents).

### Allocation Strategy

One approach is to allocate items to maximize each agent's perceived total value, iteratively checking to ensure no one envies the other.

1. **Agent 0's highest valued items**: 
   - Items 2 (95) and 3 (81) are highest valued.
   
2. **Agent 1's highest valued items**:
   - Item 3 (61) and 2 (50) are highest valued.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 because it's the highest valued item for Agent 0 and second-highest for Agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 because it's the highest valued item for Agent 1 and second-highest for Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 as it is the next highest valued item for Agent 0.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 as it balances the remaining values and is more favorable to Agent 1 compared to other options.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and the perceived value is fairly distributed.

### Verification of Envy-Freeness

- **Agent 0's allocation**: Items 1 (73) and 2 (95) with a total perceived value of 168.
- **Agent 1's allocation**: Items 0 (19) and 3 (61) with a total perceived value of 80.

Both agents receive items that maximize their perceived values without envying the other's allocation.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and both agents receive a share they perceive as fair based on their individual valuations.
