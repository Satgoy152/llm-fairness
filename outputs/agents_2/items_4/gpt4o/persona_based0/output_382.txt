Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  77   4  25  76
1  24  35  74  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where neither agent envies the other's bundle of items. This is known as an envy-free allocation. Given the valuations, we need to balance the total perceived value each agent receives.

The valuations for the agents are as follows:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 25
  - Item 3: 76

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 74
  - Item 3: 57

To find an envy-free allocation, we consider the perceived value of each item to each agent and aim to allocate items to balance these values across the agents.

Let's evaluate some possible allocations:

1. Allocate items based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent.
2. Ensure that the allocation gives each agent approximately equal perceived value.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Allocate Item 0 and Item 3 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 1 and Item 2 to Agent 1.

Agent 0's bundle: 
- Item 0: 77
- Item 3: 76
- Total perceived value: 153

Agent 1's bundle: 
- Item 1: 35
- Item 2: 74
- Total perceived value: 109

This allocation gives Agent 0 a bundle with a higher total value based on their valuations, but if we look at the perceived values from the opposite agent's perspective:

- Agent 1 perceives the value of their bundle as: 109
- Agent 1 perceives the value of Agent 0's bundle as: 81 (24 for Item 0 and 57 for Item 3)

Similarly:

- Agent 0 perceives the value of their own bundle as: 153
- Agent 0 perceives the value of Agent 1's bundle as: 99 (4 for Item 1 and 25 for Item 2)

With this allocation, neither agent envies the other since each perceives their own allocation as better or equal to what they could have received by swapping.

Thus, the allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
