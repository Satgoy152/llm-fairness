Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  74  67  25
1  55  35  50   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that minimizes envy between the agents.

The valuation matrix is as follows:

| Item   | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Item 0 | 95      | 55      |
| Item 1 | 74      | 35      |
| Item 2 | 67      | 50      |
| Item 3 | 25      | 4       |

Let's assess the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive certain items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Total valuation if they get items 0, 1, 2: 95 + 74 + 67 = 236
   - Total valuation if they get items 0, 1, 3: 95 + 74 + 25 = 194
   - Total valuation if they get items 0, 2, 3: 95 + 67 + 25 = 187
   - Total valuation if they get items 1, 2, 3: 74 + 67 + 25 = 166

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Total valuation if they get items 0, 1, 2: 55 + 35 + 50 = 140
   - Total valuation if they get items 0, 1, 3: 55 + 35 + 4 = 94
   - Total valuation if they get items 0, 2, 3: 55 + 50 + 4 = 109
   - Total valuation if they get items 1, 2, 3: 35 + 50 + 4 = 89

To ensure a fair distribution, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives. 

To achieve this, we can try the following allocation:
- **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 3.
- **Agent 1** gets items 1 and 2.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent under this allocation:
- **Agent 0**: 95 (Item 0) + 25 (Item 3) = 120
- **Agent 1**: 35 (Item 1) + 50 (Item 2) = 85

While this allocation does not make the total values identical, it does minimize the envy given the higher preferences of Agent 0 for item 0, which they value significantly more than Agent 1. Agent 1 receives two items that they value reasonably well.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
