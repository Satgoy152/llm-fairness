Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3
0  81  79  25  32
1  53  15  20  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as: [81, 79, 25, 32]
- Agent 1 values items as: [53, 15, 20, 56]

Let's analyze potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0's preferences:**
   - Highest value for item 0 (81) and item 1 (79).

2. **Agent 1's preferences:**
   - Highest value for item 3 (56) and item 0 (53).

Considering these preferences:

- Agent 0 should receive items 0 and 1, as these have the highest values for them.
- Agent 1 should receive items 2 and 3, with item 3 being highly valued and item 2 being the next available item.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items and attempts to respect each agent's highest valuations. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the satisfaction of both agents according to their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.
