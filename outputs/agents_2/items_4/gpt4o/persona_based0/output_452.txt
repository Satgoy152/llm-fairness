Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3
0  64  90  69  57
1  23  57  58  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Identify the Maximum Valuation for Each Agent:**  
   - Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1 (90).
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2 (58).

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Valuation While Minimizing Envy:**
   - Start by allocating the items that each agent values the highest.
   - Agent 0 should receive item 1.
   - Agent 1 should receive item 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items to Balance the Total Valuation:**
   - Allocate items to make the total valuation for each agent as close as possible.
   - Agent 0 can get item 0, which they value at 64, leading to a total valuation of 154 (64 + 90).
   - Agent 1 can get item 3, which they value at 36, leading to a total valuation of 94 (58 + 36).

This allocation strategy ensures each agent receives two items, and the allocations are based on maximizing individual valuations while distributing items fairly.

Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
