Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3
0  33  75  68  21
1  30  57   6  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations of the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let us examine the given valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [33, 75, 68, 21]
Agent 1: [30, 57,  6, 89]
```

A good approach to achieving envy-freeness and fairness is to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value of their allocation. We will try to distribute the items such that the difference in total valuations between the agents is minimized.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 1**: This item has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (75) and also has a relatively high valuation for Agent 1 (57). Assigning it to Agent 0 maximizes their benefit.

2. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this at 68, while Agent 1 values it at only 6. Assigning this to Agent 0 makes sense as it significantly increases their perceived value without giving much value to Agent 1 if allocated otherwise.

3. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this item very highly at 89, while Agent 0 values it at only 21. Therefore, it should be allocated to Agent 1.

4. **Item 0**: This item is valued at 33 by Agent 0 and 30 by Agent 1. To balance the total perceived values and avoid envy, assign this item to Agent 1.

The allocations can be summarized as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 2
- Agent 1 receives items: 0, 3

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent feels they have a fair share based on their valuations of the items, reducing the potential for envy between the two.
