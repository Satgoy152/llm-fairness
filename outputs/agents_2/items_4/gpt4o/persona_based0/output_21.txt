Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3
0   9   4  84  31
1  18  16  77  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to assign the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's assess the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 9 (item 0) + 4 (item 1) + 84 (item 2) + 31 (item 3) = 128
- Agent 1's total valuation: 18 (item 0) + 16 (item 1) + 77 (item 2) + 51 (item 3) = 162

Now, let's try to allocate the items to maximize fairness and minimize envy:

1. **Item 2**: This is the highest-valued item for both agents. Allocating this item to Agent 0 may reduce envy since Agent 1's overall valuation is higher, and Agent 0 values this item highly.
2. **Item 3**: The second-highest valued item for both agents. Allocating this item to Agent 1 balances the high value of item 2 given to Agent 0.
3. **Item 0**: This item is more valuable to Agent 1 than Agent 0, so we allocate it to Agent 1.
4. **Item 1**: Since Agent 0 values item 1 less than Agent 1, and to balance the overall allocation, we assign item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, let's evaluate the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 1, with a total valuation of 84 (item 2) + 4 (item 1) = 88.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 0, with a total valuation of 51 (item 3) + 18 (item 0) = 69.

While this allocation isn't perfectly envy-free (since perfect envy-freeness can be challenging with indivisible items and different total valuations), it attempts to balance the high-valued items between the agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 0]
}
```
