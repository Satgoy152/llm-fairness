Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3
0   6  82  59  61
1  38  70  58  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents in a way that minimizes envy, we need to consider their valuations and try to balance the perceived value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 6
   - Item 1: 82
   - Item 2: 59
   - Item 3: 61

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 38
   - Item 1: 70
   - Item 2: 58
   - Item 3: 26

3. **Total Valuations for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: 6 (Agent 0) + 38 (Agent 1) = 44
   - Item 1: 82 (Agent 0) + 70 (Agent 1) = 152
   - Item 2: 59 (Agent 0) + 58 (Agent 1) = 117
   - Item 3: 61 (Agent 0) + 26 (Agent 1) = 87

4. **Strategy:**
   - To minimize envy and ensure a fair division, we should aim to allocate items such that the sum of the valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

5. **Allocation:**
   - Assign Item 1 and Item 3 to Agent 0. This gives Agent 0 a total value of 82 + 61 = 143.
   - Assign Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 1 a total value of 38 + 58 = 96.

This allocation provides Agent 0 with a higher total value according to their own valuation, while Agent 1 receives a lower total value. However, this allocation minimizes the difference in perceived value between the two agents, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
