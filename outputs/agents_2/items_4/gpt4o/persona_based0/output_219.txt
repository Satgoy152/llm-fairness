Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  40  90  12   0
1  79   2  89  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we first look at the valuations provided for each item by the two agents. The goal is to allocate the items such that neither agent feels that the other has received a more desirable set of items.

The valuations for each item by each agent are as follows:

- Agent 0:  
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 0

- Agent 1:  
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 2
  - Item 2: 89
  - Item 3: 86

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation from the items they receive. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Assign Item 1 (valued at 90 by Agent 0)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Assign Item 0 (valued at 79 by Agent 1)
   - Assign Item 2 (valued at 89 by Agent 1)
   - Assign Item 3 (valued at 86 by Agent 1)

Let's check the total valuation for each agent based on this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1, with a total valuation of 90.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0, 2, and 3, with a total valuation of 79 + 89 + 86 = 254.

This allocation is envy-free because:

- Agent 0 receives the item with the highest valuation according to their preferences.
- Agent 1 receives items that maximize their total valuation.

Now, let's present the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```
