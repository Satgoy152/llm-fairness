Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  63  81  70  90
1  52   5  89  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while trying to maintain envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

First, let's calculate the total valuations for each possible allocation. We have two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) and four items (Item 0, Item 1, Item 2, Item 3). The table of valuations is:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  63  81  70  90
1  52   5  89  47
```

### Possible Allocations:
1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
   - Agent 1: Items 1 and 2

   **Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: 63 + 90 = 153
   - Agent 1: 5 + 89 = 94

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
   - Agent 1: Items 0 and 2

   **Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: 81 + 90 = 171
   - Agent 1: 52 + 89 = 141

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
   - Agent 1: Items 0 and 1

   **Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: 70 + 90 = 160
   - Agent 1: 52 + 5 = 57

4. **Allocation 4:**
   - Agent 0: Items 0 and 1
   - Agent 1: Items 2 and 3

   **Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: 63 + 81 = 144
   - Agent 1: 89 + 47 = 136

After evaluating these allocations, Allocation 2 provides a balanced and fair distribution between the two agents, where both agents have relatively high valuations and the envy is minimized.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 3, while Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2, maximizing both agents' valuations while minimizing envy.
