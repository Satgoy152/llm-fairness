Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  88  51  66  47
1   8  19  88  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution as much as possible. An envy-free allocation means each agent should feel that their allocated items are at least as valuable as the items allocated to the other agent based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0's valuations:**
  - Item 0: 88
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 66
  - Item 3: 47

- **Agent 1's valuations:**
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 88
  - Item 3: 72

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to consider the following:

1. **Agent 0** highly values Item 0 and Item 2, with valuations of 88 and 66, respectively.
2. **Agent 1** highly values Item 2 and Item 3, with valuations of 88 and 72, respectively.

Based on these valuations, we can propose the following allocation strategy:

- Allocate Item 0 and Item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 2 and Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation provides each agent with items that they value highly and minimizes the potential for envy.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
