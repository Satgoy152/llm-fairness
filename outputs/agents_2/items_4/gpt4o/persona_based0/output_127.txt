Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3
0  97  51  99  93
1  21  21  92  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to address the preferences of both agents. The goal is to allocate items in such a way that neither agent has any reason to envy the other based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations for the agents:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 97
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 93

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 92
  - Item 3: 85

A potential allocation strategy that minimizes envy is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's perceived value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (99) and Item 0 (97)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (92) and Item 3 (85)

A simple allocation would be:

- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their most valued item.
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1, as it is their second-most valued item.
- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0, as it ensures Agent 0 gets another high-value item and Agent 1 has significantly lower value for it.
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1, as it balances the allocation and Agent 1 has equal valuation for Items 0 and 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items and that the perceived value from each agent's perspective is maximized given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
