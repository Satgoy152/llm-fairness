Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  19  58  55
1  36  66  56  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly between the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or at least minimizes envy to the extent possible given the discrete nature of the problem. Each agent should feel that they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

The agents' valuations of the items are as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 0 = 58, Item 1 = 19, Item 2 = 58, Item 3 = 55
- Agent 1: Item 0 = 36, Item 1 = 66, Item 2 = 56, Item 3 = 58

To find a fair allocation, we can consider the following approach:

1. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 1 (66) compared to Agent 0 (19). It makes sense to allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 2** has equal value for Agent 0 and is slightly less valued by Agent 1. Since it has the highest value for Agent 0 (58), we allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 0** is valued highly by both agents, but since Agent 0 already has Item 2, which is also highly valued by them, we allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 to balance the allocation.

4. Finally, **Item 3** is valued closely by both agents, but to maintain balance and fairness, we allocate Item 3 to Agent 0. This ensures that each agent receives two items and minimizes potential envy.

This allocation is done such that the items are distributed fairly based on the valuation, and each agent receives items they value highly.

    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 0]
}
