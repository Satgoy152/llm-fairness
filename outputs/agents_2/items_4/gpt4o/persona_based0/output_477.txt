Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3
0  28  38  68  36
1  71  34  75  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that considers their valuations, we aim to minimize envy. This means trying to allocate the items so each agent feels they have received at least as much value as the other agent, given the circumstances.

First, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 38
  - Item 2: 68
  - Item 3: 36

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 34
  - Item 2: 75
  - Item 3: 27

To minimize envy and fairly allocate the items, we look for a distribution where the perceived total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's examine potential allocations:

1. Allocate Items 0 and 3 to Agent 0:
   - Total value for Agent 0: 28 (Item 0) + 36 (Item 3) = 64
   - Total value for Agent 1: 71 (Item 0) + 27 (Item 3) = 98

2. Allocate Items 1 and 2 to Agent 1:
   - Total value for Agent 0: 38 (Item 1) + 68 (Item 2) = 106
   - Total value for Agent 1: 34 (Item 1) + 75 (Item 2) = 109

Now let's check for envy-freeness:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, which they value at 64.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, which they value at 109.

Given the constraints, this is a reasonable allocation. Agent 0 values their allocation at 64, while Agent 1 values their allocation at 109. Although there is some disparity, this distribution attempts to balance the perceived value given the agents' preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
