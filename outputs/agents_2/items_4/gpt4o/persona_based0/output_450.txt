Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  45  32   9   9
1  96  47  91  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, while considering the overall fairness of the allocation.

Given the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [45, 32, 9, 9]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [96, 47, 91, 30]

A common approach is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, known as the maximin strategy. Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. **Allocating Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 45.
   - Agent 1 values it at 96.
   - Higher value for Agent 1.

2. **Allocating Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 32.
   - Agent 1 values it at 47.
   - Higher value for Agent 1.

3. **Allocating Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 9.
   - Agent 1 values it at 91.
   - Higher value for Agent 1.

4. **Allocating Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 9.
   - Agent 1 values it at 30.
   - Higher value for Agent 1.

Considering the fair division and envy-freeness, a balanced allocation could be:
- Assign the first item (highest value for Agent 0) to Agent 0.
- Assign the remaining items to Agent 1 as they value them significantly more.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0.
- Agent 1 gets Items 1, 2, and 3.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 gets the item they value most, while Agent 1 receives the remaining items that they value more than Agent 0 does.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
