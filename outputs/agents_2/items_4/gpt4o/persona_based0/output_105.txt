Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3
0  41  21  44  99
1  79  52  92  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can utilize the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or ensuring that the allocation is envy-free to the extent possible. An envy-free allocation would mean that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 41
  - Item 1: 21
  - Item 2: 44
  - Item 3: 99

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 52
  - Item 2: 92
  - Item 3: 50

We can try to allocate the items such that both agents are satisfied with what they receive.

One approach is to assign items based on maximizing their individual preferences while ensuring envy-freeness:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued item for each agent if possible.
2. Ensure that the allocation minimizes envy by checking if any agent would prefer the other agent's allocation.

Let's start with item 3, which has the highest valuation for agent 0. Assign it to agent 0. Then, assign item 2 to agent 1, as it has the highest valuation for agent 1. 

Now, we are left with items 0 and 1.

Assign item 0 to agent 1, as it is the second-highest valued item for agent 1. Assign item 1 to agent 0.

This allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 2.

Let's check the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 21 (item 1) + 99 (item 3) = 120
- Agent 1's total valuation: 79 (item 0) + 92 (item 2) = 171

In this allocation, Agent 0 values their items at 120, and Agent 1 values their items at 171. This allocation is envy-free because Agent 0 does not prefer Agent 1's bundle over theirs, and Agent 1 does not prefer Agent 0's bundle over theirs.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
