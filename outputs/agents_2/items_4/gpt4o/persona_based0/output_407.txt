Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  28   5  50
1  51  19  19  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [51 19 19 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. Since we only have two agents and four items, we can manually calculate the possible allocations.

Given the valuation matrix:

|      | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Agent 0 | 36     | 28     | 5      | 50     |
| Agent 1 | 51     | 19     | 19     | 91     |

Let's calculate the total value each agent receives for different allocations and aim to minimize envy:

1. **Allocation 1**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1] => Value = 36 + 28 = 64
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3] => Value = 19 + 91 = 110

   Envy:
   - Agent 0's envy for Agent 1 = 110 - 64 = 46
   - Agent 1's envy for Agent 0 = 64 - 110 = -46 (No envy)

2. **Allocation 2**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 3] => Value = 36 + 50 = 86
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 2] => Value = 19 + 19 = 38

   Envy:
   - Agent 0's envy for Agent 1 = 38 - 86 = -48 (No envy)
   - Agent 1's envy for Agent 0 = 86 - 38 = 48

3. **Allocation 3**:
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2] => Value = 28 + 5 = 33
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 3] => Value = 51 + 91 = 142

   Envy:
   - Agent 0's envy for Agent 1 = 142 - 33 = 109
   - Agent 1's envy for Agent 0 = 33 - 142 = -109 (No envy)

4. **Allocation 4**:
   - Agent 0: Items [2, 3] => Value = 5 + 50 = 55
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 1] => Value = 51 + 19 = 70

   Envy:
   - Agent 0's envy for Agent 1 = 70 - 55 = 15
   - Agent 1's envy for Agent 0 = 55 - 70 = -15 (No envy)

From these allocations, Allocation 4 minimizes the maximum envy between the agents. Thus, the fair allocation with minimized envy is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
