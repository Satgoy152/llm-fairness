Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0   4  89  16  59
1  27   8  54  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation based on their valuations. We can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or minimizing the maximum envy to find a suitable allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [4, 89, 16, 59]
- Agent 1: [27, 8, 54, 35]

Let's consider the possible allocations:

1. **Assign item 1 to Agent 0**: This is because Agent 0 values item 1 the most (at 89), while Agent 1 values it the least (at 8).
2. **Assign item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most (at 54), while Agent 0 values it less (at 16).
3. **Assign item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 highly (at 59), and Agent 1 values it at 35.
4. **Assign item 0 to Agent 1**: This leaves item 0, which Agent 1 values higher (at 27) compared to Agent 0 (at 4).

By distributing items this way, we ensure that each agent receives items they value more relative to the other agent, thus minimizing potential envy.

Here is the fair allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 0]
}
```
