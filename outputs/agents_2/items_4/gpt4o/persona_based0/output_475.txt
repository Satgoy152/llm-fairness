Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3
0  34  28  40  96
1  12   8  33  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we should aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- **Agent 0's total valuation:** 34 + 28 + 40 + 96 = 198
- **Agent 1's total valuation:** 12 + 8 + 33 + 78 = 131

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they are getting a fair share of the total value in their perspective.

To achieve this:

1. **Agent 0** places the highest value on item 3 (96). Allocating item 3 to Agent 0 will give them a high-value item which will make them inclined to perceive the division as fair.
   
2. **Agent 1** places a relatively high value on item 2 (33), especially compared to their valuation of the other items. Allocating item 2 to Agent 1 will maximize their perceived value.

3. Now, let's consider the remaining items 0 and 1. We can allocate item 0 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1. This gives Agent 0 the items they value most highly (0 and 3), and Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2, which they value reasonably given their overall valuations.

Thus, the allocation could be as follows:

- **Agent 0** receives items 0 and 3.
- **Agent 1** receives items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value, and we maintain an integer allocation of the items.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
