Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  89  40   4
1  23  55  73  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation where neither agent envies the other. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation given to the other agent.

Let's first consider the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 61 + 89 + 40 + 4 = 194
- Agent 1's total valuation: 23 + 55 + 73 + 63 = 214

Now, let's examine the individual item valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 61
- Item 1: 89
- Item 2: 40
- Item 3: 4

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 23
- Item 1: 55
- Item 2: 73
- Item 3: 63

To ensure a fair division, we will try to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it the most (89).
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it the most (73).
3. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it significantly higher (61) compared to Agent 1 (23).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it more (63) compared to Agent 0 (4).

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent with this allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1] = 61 + 89 = 150
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3] = 73 + 63 = 136

Although Agent 0's total valuation is higher, this allocation minimizes envy, as each agent receives items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
