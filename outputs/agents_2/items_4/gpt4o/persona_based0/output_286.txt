Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  40  10  40  48
1  16  49  12  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free or as close as possible, we should aim to allocate the items such that each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they would value any other agent's bundle. 

Let's examine the valuations of both agents for each item:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 40
  - Item 3: 48

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 16
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 86

A fair allocation can be considered by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations while ensuring each agent receives exactly two items since there are two agents and four items in total.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. Assigning items 0 and 2 to Agent 0 and items 1 and 3 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0's total value: 40 (Item 0) + 40 (Item 2) = 80
   - Agent 1's total value: 49 (Item 1) + 86 (Item 3) = 135

2. Assigning items 0 and 3 to Agent 0 and items 1 and 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0's total value: 40 (Item 0) + 48 (Item 3) = 88
   - Agent 1's total value: 49 (Item 1) + 12 (Item 2) = 61

3. Assigning items 1 and 3 to Agent 0 and items 0 and 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 0's total value: 10 (Item 1) + 48 (Item 3) = 58
   - Agent 1's total value: 16 (Item 0) + 12 (Item 2) = 28

Among these allocations, the first one (items 0 and 2 to Agent 0, and items 1 and 3 to Agent 1) seems to be the most balanced in terms of each agent receiving high value based on their own preferences. 

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
