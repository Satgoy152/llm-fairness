Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  54  88  51  50
1  22  58  76  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering their valuations, we often aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or at least minimize envy. Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  54  88  51  50
1  22  58  76  20
```

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 54
  - Item 1: 88
  - Item 2: 51
  - Item 3: 50

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 22
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 76
  - Item 3: 20

A simple way to approach this is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items in order: Item 1 (88), Item 0 (54), Item 2 (51), Item 3 (50)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items in order: Item 2 (76), Item 1 (58), Item 0 (22), Item 3 (20)

Following this, we can attempt to allocate items to minimize envy:

- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest valuation by Agent 0).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation by Agent 1).
  
Now, Agent 0 has Item 1, and Agent 1 has Item 2. We still need to allocate Items 0 and 3:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest remaining valuation for Agent 0).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest remaining valuation for Agent 1).

This results in each agent receiving two items, with a focus on maximizing their individual valuations. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance between maximizing each agent's total valuation and distributing items fairly.
