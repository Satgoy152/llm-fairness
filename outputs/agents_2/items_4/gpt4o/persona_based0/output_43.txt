Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  91  17  86
1  98  75   3  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we aim to create an envy-free distribution. Given the valuations table:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 87  
- Item 1: 91  
- Item 2: 17  
- Item 3: 86  

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 98  
- Item 1: 75  
- Item 2: 3  
- Item 3: 85  

A common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that no agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's consider the following approach:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Valued higher by Agent 1 (98 vs. 87)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Valued higher by Agent 0 (91 vs. 75)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Valued higher by Agent 0 (17 vs. 3)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Valued higher by Agent 0 (86 vs. 85)

Based on these valuations, here's an allocation strategy that ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and minimizes envy:

- Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 1**. This is the item with the highest valuation difference favoring Agent 1.
- Assign **Items 1, 2, and 3** to **Agent 0**. These items collectively have higher valuation for Agent 0.

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total valuation of 91 + 17 + 86 = 194, and Agent 1 a valuation of 98.

This distribution is fair and minimizes envy, as Agent 0 receives more total valuation, but Agent 1 gets their highest valued item, creating a balance.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0]
}
```
