Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3
0  39  49  71  91
1  43   5  37  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items between agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their individual valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 39
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 71
  - Item 3: 91

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 43
  - Item 1: 5
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 3: 28

A strategy for achieving an envy-free allocation is to try and balance the total valuation each agent receives. One simple method is to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's utility given their preferences while ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly.

Let's consider possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 3 (91) and item 2 (71).
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 0 (43) compared to other items.

We can try the following allocation:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by them.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, since it is also highly valued by them.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it more than other items.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it is the remaining item.

Checking valuations for the proposed allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items [2, 3] with a total valuation of 71 + 91 = 162.
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1] with a total valuation of 43 + 5 = 48.

This allocation seems to give each agent items they value without significant envy, given the constraints. Agent 0 receives the items they value the most, and Agent 1 receives the item they value the most relative to others.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
