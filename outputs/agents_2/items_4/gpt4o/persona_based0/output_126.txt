Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  44   5  77
1  64  68  22  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy. One approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 32
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 5
  - Item 3: 77

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 68
  - Item 2: 22
  - Item 3: 66

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we consider the following steps:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 3 (77) and item 1 (44).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (68) and item 0 (64).

2. **Allocating Items**:
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0, as it is their highest-valued item.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1, as it is one of their highly valued items.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0, as it is also highly valued by agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1, as it is the only remaining item.

3. **Resulting Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
