Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0  11  50  28  79
1  91  42  71  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0: 11, Item 1: 50, Item 2: 28, Item 3: 79
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0: 91, Item 1: 42, Item 2: 71, Item 3: 39

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share, considering the constraints that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total allocation equals the number of items.

Given the valuations, a reasonable approach is to allocate items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent, while considering envy-freeness.

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for Item 0 (91), which is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation for the same item (11). Therefore, it makes sense to allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

2. Next, **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 3 (79), which is higher than Agent 1's valuation for the same item (39). Allocating Item 3 to Agent 0 seems fair.

3. **Agent 1** has a higher valuation for Item 2 (71) than Agent 0 (28), so allocating Item 2 to Agent 1 maximizes their valuation.

4. Finally, **Agent 0** has a higher valuation for Item 1 (50) compared to Agent 1 (42). Therefore, allocating Item 1 to Agent 0 is a fair choice.

The allocations can be summarized as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation respects the valuations and aims to minimize potential envy between agents.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
