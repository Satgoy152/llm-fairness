Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  44  28  53
1  51  49  26  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

First, let's evaluate each agent's total valuation for all items:

- **Agent 0's valuations:**
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 53
  - **Total valuation:** 36 + 44 + 28 + 53 = 161

- **Agent 1's valuations:**
  - Item 0: 51
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 97
  - **Total valuation:** 51 + 49 + 26 + 97 = 223

Now, let's allocate the items to balance the perceived value for each agent:

1. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 1 (97) and is also the highest-valued item overall. It should be allocated to Agent 1 to maximize their perceived value.

2. **Item 1** is highly valued by both agents, but comparatively, Agent 0 values it more (44) than Agent 1 (49). We can allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 0** is valued at 51 by Agent 1 and 36 by Agent 0. To provide a balance, we can allocate this item to Agent 1, as they have a higher overall valuation for all items.

4. **Item 2** is valued at 28 by Agent 0 and 26 by Agent 1. Allocating this item to Agent 0 provides a better balance since Agent 1 has already received two highly valued items.

Given these considerations, the allocations are as follows:

- **Agent 0** receives Items 1 and 2.
- **Agent 1** receives Items 0 and 3.

This allocation aims to be envy-free and fair given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
