Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0  1   2   3
0  12  6  47  64
1  69  3  60  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we will aim for an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should prefer their own allocation over the other agent's allocation based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 6
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 64

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 69
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 60
  - Item 3: 21

One approach to achieve a fair division is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring fairness. We can do this by trying different allocations and assessing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 2 and 3
  - Total valuation: 47 (item 2) + 64 (item 3) = 111

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 0 and 1
  - Total valuation: 69 (item 0) + 3 (item 1) = 72

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a total valuation that is highest for them given the constraint that each agent should get an integer number of items. Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3, which have higher valuations for them, and agent 1 receives items 0 and 1, which provide the highest combined value for them.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation is envy-free as:

- Agent 0 values their allocation at 111, which is higher than their valuation of agent 1's allocation (12 + 6 = 18).
- Agent 1 values their allocation at 72, which is higher than their valuation of agent 0's allocation (47 + 21 = 68).
