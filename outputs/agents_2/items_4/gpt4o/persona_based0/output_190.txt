Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3
0  55  86  63  52
1  86  87  25  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we aim for a distribution that minimizes envy between the agents. Each agent values items differently, and we will use these valuations to guide our allocation decision. 

Here's a summary of the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 86
  - Item 2: 63
  - Item 3: 52

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 87
  - Item 2: 25
  - Item 3: 36

To ensure envy-freeness, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring each agent does not prefer the items allocated to the other agent over their own.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 86.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 87.
   - Both have high valuations, but Agent 1 has a slightly higher valuation. Thus, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 55.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 at 86.
   - Agent 1 has a higher valuation, but since item 1 was already allocated to Agent 1, we allocate item 0 to Agent 0 to balance the allocations.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 at 63.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 at 25.
   - Agent 0 has a significantly higher valuation for item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 52.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 36.
   - Since Agent 0 has already received two items with high valuations, and Agent 1 has received fewer items, allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items according to their preferences, minimizing envy and maintaining a fair distribution.
