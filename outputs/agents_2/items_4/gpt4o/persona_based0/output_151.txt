Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3
0  14  48  78  66
1   0  98  10  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between two agents, we aim to satisfy the criterion of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of the other agent over their own. Given the valuations for each item by the agents, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

### Agent Valuations

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 14
  - Item 1: 48
  - Item 2: 78
  - Item 3: 66

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 0
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 10
  - Item 3: 10

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 1 highly values Item 1 (98) compared to Agent 0 (48),** so it is reasonable to assign Item 1 to Agent 1 to reduce the potential for envy.
   
2. **Agent 0 highly values Items 2 (78) and 3 (66),** compared to Agent 1's valuations (10 each), so we can allocate Items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 0,** while not valued by Agent 1 (0), is valued at 14 by Agent 0. Given the current allocations, it would be fair to allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.

### Allocations

After considering the valuations and aiming for an envy-free distribution, we arrive at the following allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0, 2, 3
- **Agent 1:** Item 1

This allocation ensures that both agents receive the items that they value most, while minimizing potential envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1]
}
```
