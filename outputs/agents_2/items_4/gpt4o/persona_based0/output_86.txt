Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  47  91  67
1  47  97  69  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items between the two agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. A common approach is to use the "Envy-Free" division, where each agent prefers their own allocation over that of the other agent.

Let's evaluate the value each agent places on each item:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 47
  - Item 2: 91
  - Item 3: 67

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 69
  - Item 3: 13

The goal is to allocate these items so that each agent values their bundle at least as much (or more) as they value the other agent's bundle.

To achieve this:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values it at 91, which is the highest among all items for them.
   - Agent 1 values it at 69, which is less than Agent 0's valuation.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 97, which is the highest among all items.
   - Agent 0 values it at 47.

3. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 67.
   - Agent 1 values it at 13, which is significantly lower than Agent 0's valuation.

4. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 47.
   - Agent 0 values it at 1.

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 91 (Item 2) + 67 (Item 3) = 158
- Agent 1's total valuation: 97 (Item 1) + 47 (Item 0) = 144

This allocation is envy-free because each agent prefers their allocation to the other. Let's present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 0]
}
```
