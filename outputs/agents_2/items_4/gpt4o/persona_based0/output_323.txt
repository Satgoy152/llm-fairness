Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3
0  67  10  19  90
1  74  64  39  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations:
- Agent 0 values the items as: [67, 10, 19, 90]
- Agent 1 values the items as: [74, 64, 39, 73]

A simple approach to ensure each agent gets some items is to use the "maximum gain" strategy, where each agent receives the item that provides them with the most utility.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how we might allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**'s highest valuation is for item 3 (value of 90).
2. **Agent 1**'s highest valuation is for item 0 (value of 74).

Assign these items first:
- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.

Now, consider the remaining items (1 and 2):
- For item 1, Agent 0 values it at 10, and Agent 1 values it at 64. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- For item 2, Agent 0 values it at 19, and Agent 1 values it at 39. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

This results in the allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 2.

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and ensures all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
