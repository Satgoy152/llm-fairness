Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3
0   9  14  85  90
1  75  18  25  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

Agent 0:
- Item 0: 9
- Item 1: 14
- Item 2: 85
- Item 3: 90

Agent 1:
- Item 0: 75
- Item 1: 18
- Item 2: 25
- Item 3: 37

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we will attempt to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

**Step 1: Initial Consideration**
- Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 3, and these have high valuations compared to other items.
- Agent 1 highly values item 0, and has moderate valuations for other items.

**Step 2: Allocation Strategy**
- Assign items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:
  - Agent 0 should receive the items they value the most, which are items 2 and 3.
  - Agent 1 should receive the items they value more than Agent 0, especially item 0.

**Step 3: Final Allocation**
- Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 1.

**Valuation Check**
- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3: Total valuation: 85 + 90 = 175
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1: Total valuation: 75 + 18 = 93

This allocation is envy-free since each agent receives the items they value the most according to their own preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
