Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3
0  50  90  37  14
1  25  44  86  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1) while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items. We will try to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy between the agents.

Here are the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 50
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 3: 14

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 44
  - Item 2: 86
  - Item 3: 93

We need to allocate the 4 items to the 2 agents. A common approach is to start by looking at the highest valuations and attempt to allocate them in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

1. **Assign the highest valued items:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for Item 1 (value 90).
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for Item 3 (value 93).

2. **Distribute remaining items:**
   - After allocating Item 1 to Agent 0 and Item 3 to Agent 1, we have Items 0 and 2 left.
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 50 and Item 2 at 37.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 25 and Item 2 at 86.

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance total value:**
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (value 50 for Agent 0, higher than Agent 1's value of 25).
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value 86 for Agent 1, higher than Agent 0's value of 37).

Now let's check the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1: 
  - Total value = 50 (Item 0) + 90 (Item 1) = 140

- Agent 1 receives Items 2 and 3:
  - Total value = 86 (Item 2) + 93 (Item 3) = 179

While this allocation may not be perfectly envy-free, it fairly distributes the items based on individual valuations and total values received.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
