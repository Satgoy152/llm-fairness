Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3
0  19  37  29  94
1  21  51  95  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while minimizing envy, we need to consider their valuations and aim for an envy-free or envy-minimized distribution. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent.

Given the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
|   0   |   19   |   37   |   29   |   94   |
|   1   |   21   |   51   |   95   |   43   |

Let's consider the following steps:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (95), so it makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 1.

2. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 3 the highest (94), so it makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 0.

3. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 1 more than Agent 0 (51 vs. 37).

4. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 0 more than Agent 1 (19 vs. 21).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some items they value relatively highly, and it is reasonably fair given their valuations.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
