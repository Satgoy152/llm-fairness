Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  16  91  18
1  93  75  51  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other allocation. Given the agents' valuations, we can approach this problem by trying to ensure that each agent gets items they highly value.

Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [8, 16, 91, 18]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [93, 75, 51, 83]

A potential envy-free allocation can be achieved by the following steps:

1. **Identify the most valued items by each agent:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (91).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (93).

2. **Assign these items to each agent:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Agent 0's next highest valuations are for items 3 and 1.
   - Agent 1's next highest valuations are for items 1 and 3.

   To balance the allocation:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (valued at 75 by Agent 1, higher than 16 by Agent 0).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (valued at 18 by Agent 0, lower than 83 by Agent 1 but ensures Agent 0 receives more than just one item).

This allocation ensures:
- Agent 0 receives items they value highly (2 and 3).
- Agent 1 receives items they value highly (0 and 1).
- Each agent ends up with two items, minimizing potential envy.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
