Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0  96  17  30  18
1  55   4  72  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent is satisfied with their allocation given their valuations. Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0's valuations:
Item 0: 96
Item 1: 17
Item 2: 30
Item 3: 18

Agent 1's valuations:
Item 0: 55
Item 1: 4
Item 2: 72
Item 3: 78
```

One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while trying to ensure that no agent envies the other's allocation. Let's consider the following allocation:

- **Agent 0** strongly values Item 0 (96) and moderately values Item 2 (30).
- **Agent 1** strongly values Item 3 (78) and Item 2 (72).

Given these observations, we can allocate the items as follows to maximize individual happiness and minimize envy:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (high value to Agent 0, relatively lower to Agent 1).
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 (lowest value to both, but Agent 0 gets it since Agent 1 has better valued items).
- Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (high value to Agent 1).
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (high value to Agent 1).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1].
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 3].

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items and the total allocation of 4 items is maintained.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
