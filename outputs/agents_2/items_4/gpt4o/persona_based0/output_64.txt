Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  65  37  62
1  50  48   4  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and, ideally, no agent envies the other's allocation.

We have the following valuations:

- Agent 0: [32, 65, 37, 62]
- Agent 1: [50, 48, 4, 66]

We can try to allocate the items by maximizing each agent's utility, while also trying to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation. Here's one possible approach:

1. Start by identifying the item that each agent values the most:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most (65).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (66).

2. Allocate each agent their highest valued item:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. Consider the remaining items (0 and 2) and their values:
   - Agent 0 values: Item 0 (32), Item 2 (37)
   - Agent 1 values: Item 0 (50), Item 2 (4)

4. Allocate the remaining items by considering each agent's second highest valuation:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value 50 for Agent 1 vs. 32 for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 37 for Agent 0 vs. 4 for Agent 1).

By following this method, we end up with the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.

This allocation is likely to be envy-free, as each agent receives the items they value most highly among those available after each allocation step.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
