Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0  32  33  90  78
1  39  42  51  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should consider the valuations that each agent has for each item. Our goal is to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: Item 0 = 32, Item 1 = 33, Item 2 = 90, Item 3 = 78
- Agent 1's valuations: Item 0 = 39, Item 1 = 42, Item 2 = 51, Item 3 = 39

A straightforward approach is to calculate the total valuation for each possible allocation and choose the one that results in the most balanced distribution in terms of total value perceived by each agent.

Let's consider the following allocation:
- Allocate Item 2 (value 90 to Agent 0, 51 to Agent 1) to Agent 0 as it provides the highest value to them.
- Allocate Item 3 (value 78 to Agent 0, 39 to Agent 1) to Agent 0.
- Allocate Item 1 (value 33 to Agent 0, 42 to Agent 1) to Agent 1.
- Allocate Item 0 (value 32 to Agent 0, 39 to Agent 1) to Agent 1.

This allocation is considered fair because:
- Agent 0 receives a total value of 168 (90 from Item 2 and 78 from Item 3).
- Agent 1 receives a total value of 81 (42 from Item 1 and 39 from Item 0).

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 4.
