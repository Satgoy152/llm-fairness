Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  72  65  55  34
1   3  32  26  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that the distribution is as balanced as possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving this problem:

1. **Summing Valuations:** Calculate the total value each agent places on all items to understand their overall preferences:
   - Agent 0: \( 72 + 65 + 55 + 34 = 226 \)
   - Agent 1: \( 3 + 32 + 26 + 30 = 91 \)

2. **Item Preferences:** Review how each agent values each item:
   - For Item 0: Agent 0 values it highly (72), while Agent 1 values it very low (3).
   - For Item 1: Agent 0 has a high valuation (65), whereas Agent 1's valuation is moderate (32).
   - For Item 2: Agent 0 values it moderately (55), and Agent 1 values it slightly lower (26).
   - For Item 3: Agent 0 values it the lowest (34), and Agent 1 values it moderately (30).

3. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (72 vs. 3).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 (30 vs. 34).

4. **Remaining Items for Allocation:** Items 1 and 2 need to be allocated.

5. **Balancing Remaining Items:**
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 because their valuation is significantly higher (65 vs. 32).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 to balance the overall value since Agent 1 values it moderately, and Agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation (55 vs. 26).

6. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 1 receives Items 2 and 3.

By following this procedure, both agents receive items that they value, with a focus on reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
