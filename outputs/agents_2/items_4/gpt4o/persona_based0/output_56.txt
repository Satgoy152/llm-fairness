Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  76  36  94  33
1  61  64   5  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels another agent received a more valuable set of items than they did. Here's a breakdown of the approach:

1. **Total Valuation Calculation**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   - Agent 0 values the items at: 76 + 36 + 94 + 33 = 239.
   - Agent 1 values the items at: 61 + 64 + 5 + 80 = 210.

2. **Initial Allocation by Highest Valuation**: Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it more (76 vs. 61).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it more (64 vs. 36).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it more (94 vs. 5).
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (80 vs. 33).

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: After the initial allocation, check to ensure that the allocation is envy-free.
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 76 + 94 = 170.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3, with a total valuation of 64 + 80 = 144.

4. **Adjust for Fairness**: Ensure both agents feel they have received a fair share. Since the valuation is subjective, the initial allocation appears fair given the higher total valuation for Agent 0.

Given the above considerations, the allocations can be presented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation is fair in the sense that neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their own valuation of the items.
