Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  40  72  67  47
1  45  57  88  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should not envy the other's allocation based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 valuations: [40, 72, 67, 47]
- Agent 1 valuations: [45, 57, 88, 58]

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation. One potential method is to maximize the total value for each agent while keeping allocations fair.

### Calculation for Fair Allocation:

1. **Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 total value: 40 + 72 + 67 + 47 = 226
   - Agent 1 total value: 45 + 57 + 88 + 58 = 248

2. **Maximize the Value for Each Agent:**
   - Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent in descending order of their valuations.

3. **Potential Allocation:**
   - **Agent 0:**
     - Item 1 (value 72)
     - Item 2 (value 67)

   - **Agent 1:**
     - Item 0 (value 45)
     - Item 3 (value 58)

4. **Verification of Fairness:**
   - Agent 0 receives items with a total valuation of 72 + 67 = 139.
   - Agent 1 receives items with a total valuation of 45 + 58 = 103.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value relatively highly, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 4 items between the two agents, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and is based on their respective valuations.
