Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3
0  53  21  35  15
1  94  76  18  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints.

Here's the process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **List the valuations** for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Items have values [53, 21, 35, 15]
   - Agent 1: Items have values [94, 76, 18, 97]

2. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (53).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most (97).

3. **Assign the most valued items initially**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate the remaining items**:
   - Remaining items are 1 and 2.
   - Agent 0 values item 2 more than item 1 (35 vs. 21).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 more than item 2 (76 vs. 18).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to maximize the preferences of both agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives their most preferred available item.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent two items, and the total number of allocated items is 4, satisfying the problem's requirements.
