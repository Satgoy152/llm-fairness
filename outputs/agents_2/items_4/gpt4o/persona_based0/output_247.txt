Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  11  72  79  81
1  39   7  91  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free solution if possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent prefers their own bundle of items over any other agent's bundle or is indifferent.

Given the agents' valuations for the items, let's examine the total value each agent derives from all items:

- Agent 0: Total value = 11 + 72 + 79 + 81 = 243
- Agent 1: Total value = 39 + 7 + 91 + 69 = 206

The goal is to allocate the 4 items such that each agent is satisfied with their share, and if possible, no agent envies the other's allocation. 

Let's examine some possible allocations:

1. **Allocation Plan:**
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0: Value = 72
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0: Value = 81
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1: Value = 39
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1: Value = 91

**Agent 0:**
- Total Value from Items: 72 (Item 1) + 81 (Item 3) = 153

**Agent 1:**
- Total Value from Items: 39 (Item 0) + 91 (Item 2) = 130

In this allocation, both agents have a decent share of the value, and the distribution is somewhat balanced based on their preferences. This allocation doesn't strictly meet envy-freeness but attempts to balance the satisfaction among agents based on their preferences.

Now, representing the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
