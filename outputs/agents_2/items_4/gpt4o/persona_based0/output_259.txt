Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3
0  62   4  49   3
1  56  47  67  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value Per Agent:** Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items.

2. **Allocate Items:** Allocate items to ensure that each agent gets the items they value the most, while also ensuring that the allocation is envy-free.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0 Valuations:**
  - Item 0: 62
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 49
  - Item 3: 3
  - **Total Value for Agent 0** = 62 + 4 + 49 + 3 = 118

- **Agent 1 Valuations:**
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 47
  - Item 2: 67
  - Item 3: 61
  - **Total Value for Agent 1** = 56 + 47 + 67 + 61 = 231

Given these valuations, we want to allocate items to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation. One approach to achieve this is by considering a maximin strategy, where we attempt to maximize the minimum satisfaction of each agent.

**Allocation Strategy:**

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Highest valued items: Item 0 (62), Item 2 (49)
- **Agent 1:**
  - Highest valued items: Item 2 (67), Item 3 (61)

Considering Agent 0 values Item 0 the most and Agent 1 values Item 2 the most, we can start by allocating these items to their respective agents. 

Since Agent 0 values Item 0 and Item 2 highly, and Agent 1 values Item 2 highly, we can allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 to avoid envy, and allocate Item 0 to Agent 0. 

This leaves Items 1 and 3, which can be allocated based on the next highest values. Agent 1 values Item 3 at 61, which is a high value compared to Agent 0's value for Item 3, so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 1. Finally, Item 1 can go to Agent 0, as Agent 1's value for Item 1 is higher than Agent 0's, but not significantly enough to cause envy given the other allocations.

**Final Allocations:**

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3

This allocation is designed to be envy-free given the valuations provided.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
