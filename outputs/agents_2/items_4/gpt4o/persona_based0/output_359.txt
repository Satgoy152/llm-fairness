Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3
0  31  77  28  78
1  84  18  63  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by the other agent.

Each agent's valuation for the items is as follows:

- Agent 0: [31, 77, 28, 78]
- Agent 1: [84, 18, 63, 44]

A fair allocation strategy could involve maximizing the total value each agent gets from their assigned items, while ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it more (84 vs 31).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it more (77 vs 18).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they value it more (63 vs 28).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it more (78 vs 44).

Now, let's check the values each agent gets:

- Agent 0 receives items [1, 3] with a total valuation of 77 + 78 = 155.
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 2] with a total valuation of 84 + 63 = 147.

Neither agent should envy the other, as each agent receives items that maximize their valuation based on their preferences.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
