Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  23  76   1  81
1  99  74  60  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring envy-freeness. The objective is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent for each item:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (23), Item 1 (76), Item 2 (1), Item 3 (81)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (99), Item 1 (74), Item 2 (60), Item 3 (74)

Let's consider the potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: Agent 0 highly values Item 3 (81) and Item 1 (76).
2. **Agent 1's Preferences**: Agent 1 highly values Item 0 (99) and Item 2 (60).

Given these preferences, the allocation can be done as follows to ensure a fair division:

- Assign Agent 0 the items they value the most: Item 1 (76) and Item 3 (81).
- Assign Agent 1 the items they value the most: Item 0 (99) and Item 2 (60).

This allocation gives each agent access to items they highly value, and it ensures that both agents receive two items each.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
