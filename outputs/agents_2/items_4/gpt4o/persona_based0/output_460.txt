Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  58   4  13
1  19  23  31  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents with the goal of minimizing envy, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. Here's a breakdown of the valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 4
  - Item 3: 13

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 23
  - Item 2: 31
  - Item 3: 97

Given these valuations, we want to ensure that each agent gets items such that they value their own set at least as much as they value the set given to the other agent. We can aim for an allocation where each agent gets the items they value most.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest-valued items: Item 0 and Item 1 (each valued at 58)
  
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest-valued item: Item 3 (valued at 97)
   - Next highest, considering what's left: Item 2 (valued at 31)

### Proposed Allocation

- **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 1. These are the items they value the highest, minimizing their potential envy.

- **Agent 1** gets items 2 and 3. Item 3 is their highest-valued item, and item 2 is the next best from the remaining items.

This allocation ensures both agents are happy with their own allocations and minimizes possible envy between them.

### JSON Output

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
