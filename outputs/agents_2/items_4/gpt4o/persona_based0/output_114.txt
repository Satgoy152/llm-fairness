Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3
0  88  17  39   9
1  40  19  44  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to make the allocation as balanced as possible. 

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [88, 17, 39, 9]
- Agent 1: [40, 19, 44, 55]

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 88 + 17 + 39 + 9 = 153
- Total value for Agent 1: 40 + 19 + 44 + 55 = 158

Now we should aim for an allocation where each agent perceives they are receiving a fair share of the total value according to their own valuations. Given there are 4 items, each agent should ideally feel they are receiving half the value of all items, though with integer allocations and differing valuations, perfect envy-freeness may not be possible. We'll strive for a balanced allocation.

### Possible Allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0. This is the most valued item for Agent 0.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1. This is the most valued item for Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1. This is the second most valued item for Agent 1.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 0. This balances the total number of items assigned.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0's allocation: Items 0 and 1 with values [88, 17]. Total value = 88 + 17 = 105
- Agent 1's allocation: Items 2 and 3 with values [44, 55]. Total value = 44 + 55 = 99

Though Agent 0 receives a higher perceived value from their allocation, the items are distributed in such a way that each agent receives two items, and attempts to balance according to preferences.

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
