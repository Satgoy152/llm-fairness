Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3
0  38  62  81  65
1  48  89  22  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to distribute the items among the agents such that neither agent prefers the allocation of the other agent to their own allocation. This can be approached by ensuring each agent values their received items at least as much as they would value the other agent's allocation.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 38 + 62 + 81 + 65 = 246
- Agent 1: 48 + 89 + 22 + 61 = 220

A simple approach to ensure envy-freeness is to assign the items greedily based on each agent's valuation. We will start by assigning the highest-valued item to each agent in rounds, ensuring all items are allocated.

1. For Agent 0, the highest-valued item is item 2 (value 81).
2. For Agent 1, the highest-valued item is item 1 (value 89).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

3. Agent 0 will get item 3 (value 65).
4. Agent 1 will get item 0 (value 48).

This gives us the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1

Each agent receives two items, and the allocation attempts to maximize the sum value of items for each agent based on their preferences.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
