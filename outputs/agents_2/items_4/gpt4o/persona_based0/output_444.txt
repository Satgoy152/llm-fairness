Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0  16  27  28  56
1  60  47  51  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the differing valuations of the items by the agents. 

**Agent Valuations:**

- Agent 0: Values items as [16, 27, 28, 56]
- Agent 1: Values items as [60, 47, 51, 97]

Based on these valuations, we can calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 16 + 27 + 28 + 56 = 127
- Total value for Agent 1: 60 + 47 + 51 + 97 = 255

The goal is to allocate the items such that the perceived value distribution is as equal as possible.

**Fair Allocation Strategy:**

1. Start by considering the highest valued items for each agent to ensure they receive items that they value highly.
2. Attempt to equalize the sum of values for each agent's allocation.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- Allocate items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 1.
  - Agent 1 values these items at 60 + 47 + 51 = 158.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
  - Agent 0 values this item at 56.

**Check for Envy-Freeness:**

- Agent 0 receives item 3 with a valuation of 56.
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 1, and 2 with a valuation of 158.

Agent 1 clearly has a higher total valuation, but given that Agent 0 receives one of their highly-valued items, this allocation attempts to respect their preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

**Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with an attempt to consider each agent's preferences.
