Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3
0  34  47   9  98
1  36  61  43  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value for each agent. In this context, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as high as possible, relative to the other agent's allocations.

Let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 47
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 98

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 36
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 43
  - Item 3: 68

Now, let's consider possible allocations:

1. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 3 the most (98), which is significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation (68). This allocation maximizes Agent 0’s satisfaction.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (61), which is also higher compared to Agent 0's valuation (47). This allocation maximizes Agent 1’s satisfaction.

3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 0 slightly more (36) than Agent 0 (34).

4. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 2 (9), which is lower than Agent 1’s valuation (43), but since other items have been distributed to maximize overall satisfaction, Item 2 goes to Agent 0.

With these allocations, both agents receive two items each, and both perceive their respective allocations as fair and envy-free since they maximize their perceived value given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
