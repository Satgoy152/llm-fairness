Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0  1   2   3
0  96  7   3  11
1  20  8  47  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for an envy-free division, we can proceed with the following:

1. **Agent Valuation Summary:**
   - Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
     - Item 0: 96
     - Item 1: 7
     - Item 2: 3
     - Item 3: 11
   - Agent 1 values the items as follows:
     - Item 0: 20
     - Item 1: 8
     - Item 2: 47
     - Item 3: 23

2. **Total Valuation:**
   - Total valuation of all items by Agent 0 is 96 + 7 + 3 + 11 = 117.
   - Total valuation of all items by Agent 1 is 20 + 8 + 47 + 23 = 98.

3. **Fair Division Strategy:**
   - We aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they are getting a fair share according to their own valuations.
   - One method is to allocate items to maximize the minimum satisfaction (envy-freeness).

4. **Proposed Allocation:**
   - To Agent 0, allocate items that they value significantly more than Agent 1: Item 0.
   - To Agent 1, allocate items they value highly: Items 2 and 3.
   - Balance by giving Agent 0 another item to ensure all items are allocated: Item 1.

5. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they highly value, reducing envy and maximizing satisfaction based on their own valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
