Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0  27   5   7  36
1   5  35  13  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we will aim for an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should prefer their own bundle of items over the other's bundle based on their respective valuations.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  Item 0: 27,  
  Item 1: 5,  
  Item 2: 7,  
  Item 3: 36

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  Item 0: 5,  
  Item 1: 35,  
  Item 2: 13,  
  Item 3: 52

To achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. **Highest Valuation Priority:** Start by assigning items based on the highest valuation by an agent. 
2. **Balanced Allocation:** Ensure each agent receives 2 items, as there are 4 items in total.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 the highest at 52.

2. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 the highest at 27.

3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1:**  
   - After assigning the highest priority item to each agent, assign the next highest item to balance the allocation. Agent 1 values Item 1 at 35, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 5.

4. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0:**  
   - Finally, assign the remaining item to Agent 0. Agent 0 values Item 2 at 7, while Agent 1 values it at 13. However, this ensures both agents receive two items each.

### Final Allocation:

The final allocation that attempts to maintain fairness while considering envy-freeness is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, and Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3. This allocation considers the highest valuation preferences and ensures a balanced distribution of items.
