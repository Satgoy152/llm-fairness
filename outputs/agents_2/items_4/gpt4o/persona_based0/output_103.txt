Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  31  88   2
1  10  26  12  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we should aim to ensure that each agent receives items such that they perceive their bundle as valuable as possible, minimizing envy between the agents. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent would prefer the bundle allocated to another agent over their own bundle, according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 31
  - Item 2: 88
  - Item 3: 2

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 26
  - Item 2: 12
  - Item 3: 74

A potential fair division strategy is to allocate items in a way that balances the perceived value for each agent. We need to ensure that the sum of the valuations for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's consider the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.

Checking the total valuation for each agent:
- Agent 0: 49 (Item 0) + 88 (Item 2) = 137
- Agent 1: 26 (Item 1) + 74 (Item 3) = 100

This allocation provides Agent 0 with a higher total valuation than Agent 1, but considering the disparity in individual item valuations, this allocation minimizes potential envy, as Agent 1 places a high value on item 3, which compensates for the overall lower total value.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
