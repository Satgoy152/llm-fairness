Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  34  22  59  40
1  82  97  59  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer (or at least not envy) their own allocation over the allocation of any other agent.

Let's first summarize the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations: [34, 22, 59, 40]
- Agent 1's valuations: [82, 97, 59, 97]

The total value each agent assigns to all items is:
- Agent 0: 34 + 22 + 59 + 40 = 155
- Agent 1: 82 + 97 + 59 + 97 = 335

To find an allocation that minimizes envy, we can consider the following steps:

1. **Assign high-value items to the agent who values them most:**
   - Item 1 (value 97 for Agent 1) should be assigned to Agent 1.
   - Item 3 (value 97 for Agent 1) should also be assigned to Agent 1.

2. **Assign remaining items considering remaining preferences:**
   - Item 2 has equal value for both agents (59), so we can assign it to either without causing significant envy. Let's give it to Agent 0, who has received fewer high-value items so far.
   - Finally, assign Item 0 (value 34 for Agent 0) to Agent 0.

This leaves us with the following allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.

This allocation aims to be envy-free or close to envy-free by giving each agent some of the items they value highly. The allocations can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
