Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3
0  49  82  70  75
1  62  38  11  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to ensure that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their share of items, ideally achieving an envy-free allocation. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:  
  Item 0: 49  
  Item 1: 82  
  Item 2: 70  
  Item 3: 75  

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:  
  Item 0: 62  
  Item 1: 38  
  Item 2: 11  
  Item 3: 74  

To achieve a fair allocation, we will consider both agents' preferences and attempt to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for Item 1 (82) and Item 3 (75). Assign these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values Item 0 (62) and Item 3 (74) highly, but since Item 3 was allocated to Agent 0, we assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 1** now has Item 0, and since Item 2 has the least value to Agent 1 (11), but it is the only item left, we assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

**Final allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2.

This allocation strives to balance the total value of items each agent receives, considering their differing valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
