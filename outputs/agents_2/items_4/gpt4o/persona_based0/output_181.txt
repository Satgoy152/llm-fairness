Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3
0  17  55  47  66
1  84  98  28  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim for a division that minimizes envy and ideally achieves envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer their own allocation or be indifferent to the allocation of the other agent.

Let's analyze the valuations of each agent for all items:

- Agent 0's valuations:  
  - Item 0: 17  
  - Item 1: 55  
  - Item 2: 47  
  - Item 3: 66  

- Agent 1's valuations:  
  - Item 0: 84  
  - Item 1: 98  
  - Item 2: 28  
  - Item 3: 81  

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the following approach:

1. Identify the items that each agent values most and aim to allocate them accordingly, ensuring that each agent's total valuation is roughly balanced.
2. Given that there are 4 items and 2 agents, each agent should ideally receive 2 items.

Let's try to allocate the items based on the preferences:

- Agent 1 has higher valuations overall, especially for Items 0, 1, and 3, compared to Agent 0.
- To balance the allocation, we can give Agent 1 the items they value most, while minimizing the envy for Agent 0.

A reasonable allocation strategy is:

- Assign Item 1 (value 55) and Item 2 (value 47) to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 0 (value 84) and Item 3 (value 81) to Agent 1.

This results in:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 55 + 47 = 102
- Agent 1's total valuation: 84 + 81 = 165

This allocation minimizes envy by giving each agent a set of items that they value reasonably well, with Agent 1 receiving items that they value more overall.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
