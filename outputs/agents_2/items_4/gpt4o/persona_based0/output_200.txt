Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3
0  92  18  59  85
1  35  22  15  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. We aim to find an allocation that maximizes the satisfaction for both agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 92
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 85

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 22
  - Item 2: 15
  - Item 3: 35

To achieve a fair allocation, we typically aim for an envy-free division if possible, where no agent would prefer the other's allocation over their own given their valuations.

Let's consider a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (92) and item 3 (85). Therefore, it makes sense to allocate these two items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has lower valuations for these items compared to Agent 0. Thus, Agent 1 can take items 1 and 2, which still provide some value and are less valued by Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, fulfilling the requirement that all items are allocated, and assigns items based on higher individual valuations to attempt an envy-free division.

The final allocation is:

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.  
Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
