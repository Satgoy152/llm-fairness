Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3
0  70  34  99   8
1  24  97  35  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [70, 34, 99, 8]
Agent 1: [24, 97, 35, 92]
```

We can proceed by checking possible allocations and ensuring envy-freeness.

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 99, which is the highest valuation for any single item across both agents.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 97, which is their highest valuation for a single item.

3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**:
   - After allocating Item 2 to Agent 0, their next highest preference is Item 0, valued at 70.

4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**:
   - For Agent 1, after Item 1, their next highest preference is Item 3, valued at 92.

Checking envy-freeness:
- Agent 0 receives items [0, 2] with total value: 70 + 99 = 169.
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 3] with total value: 97 + 92 = 189.

Agent 0 does not envy Agent 1 as they value their allocation highest based on their preferences. Similarly, Agent 1 does not envy Agent 0. Thus, this allocation is envy-free.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
