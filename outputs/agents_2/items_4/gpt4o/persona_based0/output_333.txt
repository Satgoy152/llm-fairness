Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  22  56  38
1  19   0  97  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations and aiming for an envy-free distribution, we need to analyze the given valuations:

```
Valuations:
Agent 0: [21, 22, 56, 38]
Agent 1: [19, 0, 97, 36]
```

To achieve a fair division, we want to minimize envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent should not prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Let's examine possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values item 2 the highest (56).
   - Values item 3 second highest (38).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values item 2 the highest (97).
   - Values item 3 second highest (36).

Given the above, item 2 is most valuable to both agents, but significantly more to Agent 1. To minimize envy, we can allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

For the remaining items, let's try to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Give item 2 to Agent 1.
- Give items 0 and 1 to Agent 0 (as they value them slightly more than Agent 1).
- Give item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation gives:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, and 3, total value = 21 + 22 + 38 = 81.
- **Agent 1**: Item 2, total value = 97.

This allocation minimizes envy because:
- Agent 0 receives three items with a reasonable total value.
- Agent 1 receives their most valuable item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [2]
}
```
