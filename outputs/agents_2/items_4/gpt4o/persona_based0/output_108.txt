Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3
0  56  53  57  78
1  69  75  34  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we want to consider concepts such as maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent's allocations or ensuring envy-freeness if possible. Given that there are only two agents and four items, we can explore a few possible allocations:

First, let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 56
  - Item 1: 53
  - Item 2: 57
  - Item 3: 78

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 69
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 34
  - Item 3: 77

To achieve an allocation that is as fair as possible, we can examine the total valuations each agent would receive based on different allocations and try to balance them. 

### Possible Fair Allocation

1. **Allocation Attempt**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
     - Total value = 56 + 78 = 134
   - Agent 1: Items 1 and 2
     - Total value = 75 + 34 = 109

2. **Allocation Attempt**:
   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
     - Total value = 53 + 57 = 110
   - Agent 1: Items 0 and 3
     - Total value = 69 + 77 = 146

3. **Allocation Attempt (Chosen Allocation)**:
   - Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
     - Total value = 57 + 78 = 135
   - Agent 1: Items 0 and 1
     - Total value = 69 + 75 = 144

This allocation attempt provides relatively close valuations for both agents, balancing their total perceived values. Although it may not be perfectly envy-free, it tries to minimize the difference in total valuations.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total values each agent receives from their allocated items.
