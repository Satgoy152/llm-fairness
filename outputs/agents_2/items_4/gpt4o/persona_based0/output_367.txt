Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  50  97  73
1  76  98  37  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items so that each agent is satisfied with their allocation and no agent envies the allocation of another, we should aim to maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive. We'll use the concept of maximizing total value and consider envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the items given to another agent over their own allocation.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 89     | 50     | 97     | 73     |
| 1     | 76     | 98     | 37     | 21     |

To achieve a fair division, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item**: This helps in understanding which items are more valued overall.
   - Total valuation for Item 0: 89 + 76 = 165
   - Total valuation for Item 1: 50 + 98 = 148
   - Total valuation for Item 2: 97 + 37 = 134
   - Total valuation for Item 3: 73 + 21 = 94

2. **Prioritize Assigning High-Value Items**: Assign items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that no agent envies another. 

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it at 97, which is the highest individual valuation.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it at 98, which is the highest individual valuation.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it at 89, which is higher than Agent 1â€™s valuation of 76.
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as this balances the allocation and Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.

Let's now verify the allocation:
- Agent 0 receives Items [0, 2] with a total value of 89 + 97 = 186.
- Agent 1 receives Items [1, 3] with a total value of 98 + 21 = 119.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value most highly and no agent envies the allocation of another agent.

Finally, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
