Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3
0  99  98  81  59
1  64  83  76   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to allocate items such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation.

The valuations are as follows:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 99
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 3: 59

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 83
  - Item 2: 76
  - Item 3: 7

A fair distribution should ensure that the total value of items for each agent is as balanced as possible, given the valuations. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 should receive the items that maximize their total valuation without making Agent 1 envious.
2. Agent 1 should receive the items that maximize their total valuation without making Agent 0 envious.

One possible allocation is:

- Agent 0 receives Item 0 and Item 3.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1 and Item 2.

Let's verify:

- Total valuation for Agent 0 = 99 (Item 0) + 59 (Item 3) = 158
- Total valuation for Agent 1 = 83 (Item 1) + 76 (Item 2) = 159

This allocation is fairly balanced in terms of the valuations, with each agent receiving items of similar total value. Neither agent should feel envious of the other's allocation given their respective valuations.

The final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
