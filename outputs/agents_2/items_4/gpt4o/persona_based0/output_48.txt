Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  92  16  84  53
1  14  61   5  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items between the two agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to each item. We aim to allocate the items such that the agents' allocations are as envy-free as possible, given the integer constraints.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 92
  - Item 1: 16
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 53
  
- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 14
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 5
  - Item 3: 36

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Highest Valuations**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 the most (92), followed by Item 2 (84).
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (61), followed by Item 3 (36).

2. **Potential Allocation**:
   - **Agent 0**: Assign Item 0 and Item 2. These are the items Agent 0 values the most.
   - **Agent 1**: Assign Item 1 and Item 3. These are the items Agent 1 values the most.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, reducing potential envy:

- **Agent 0**: Total valuation = 92 (Item 0) + 84 (Item 2) = 176
- **Agent 1**: Total valuation = 61 (Item 1) + 36 (Item 3) = 97

While not perfectly envy-free, this allocation respects the highest preferences of each agent given the integer constraint of item allocations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
