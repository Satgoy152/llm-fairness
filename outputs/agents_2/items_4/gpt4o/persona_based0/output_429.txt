Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3
0  10  18   0  60
1  84   0  78   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84  0 78  8]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents while considering their valuations, the goal is to ensure that no agent envies the other, meaning each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations in the table:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 10
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 0
  - Item 3: 60

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 84
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 78
  - Item 3: 8

A possible envy-free allocation can be achieved by considering the highest combined valuations and ensuring neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Here is one fair allocation:

- Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Assign items 0, 1, and 2 to agent 1.

Now let's verify the allocation:

For Agent 0:
- Allocated item: [3]
- Total value: 60

For Agent 1:
- Allocated items: [0, 1, 2]
- Total value: 162

Neither agent would prefer the other's allocation given their own valuation of the items.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
