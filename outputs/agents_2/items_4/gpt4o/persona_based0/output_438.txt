Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3
0  59  51  80  67
1  73  82   1   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value without feeling envious of the other agent's allocation.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 51
  - Item 2: 80
  - Item 3: 67

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 82
  - Item 2: 1
  - Item 3: 5

A strategy to achieve a fair division is to allocate items by maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify the Most Valuable Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (80).
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (82).

2. **Allocate Each Agent Their Most Valued Item:**
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate the Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 0 and 3.
   - Agent 0's second preference is Item 3 (67), and Agent 1's second preference is Item 0 (73).

4. **Complete the Allocation:**
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

### Resulting Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 1.

Both agents receive two items, and each has a higher or comparable value for their allocated items compared to what the other agent has. This helps ensure that the allocation is envy-free.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
