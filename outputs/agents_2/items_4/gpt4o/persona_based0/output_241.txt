Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3
0  66  30  51  12
1  19  18  64  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we strive to achieve envy-freeness where possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as the allocation received by any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Here are the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 30
  - Item 2: 51
  - Item 3: 12

- Agent 1's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 64
  - Item 3: 42

First, let's identify which items are most valued by each agent:

- Agent 0 values Item 0 the most (66).
- Agent 1 values Item 2 the most (64).

To start, we will allocate these most valued items to each agent:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

Now consider the remaining items:

- Remaining items: Item 1 and Item 3.

Next, let's allocate the remaining items while ensuring a fair distribution of value as perceived by each agent:

- Agent 0's next highest value is Item 2, which is already given to Agent 1. The next best available is Item 1 (30).
- Agent 1's next highest available value is Item 3 (42).

Allocate:

3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

Now each agent has two items, and we have allocated all items. Let's confirm the allocation is envy-free:

- Agent 0 has Items 0 and 1 with combined value = 66 + 30 = 96.
- Agent 1 has Items 2 and 3 with combined value = 64 + 42 = 106.

Agent 0 values their set (0, 1) more than Agent 1's set (2, 3) based on their own valuations, and vice versa for Agent 1. This suggests an envy-free allocation.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
