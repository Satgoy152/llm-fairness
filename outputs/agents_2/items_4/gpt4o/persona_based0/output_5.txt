Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0  50  32  22  61
1  94  61  73  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free, we need to ensure that each agent prefers their own allocation over the other's. The valuations are given as follows:

- Agent 0: Values items [50, 32, 22, 61]
- Agent 1: Values items [94, 61, 73, 93]

First, we calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 50 + 32 + 22 + 61 = 165
- Total value for Agent 1 = 94 + 61 + 73 + 93 = 321

We aim to distribute the items to minimize envy, which means each agent should feel they are getting as much value as possible from their perspective.

Let's consider the most valuable items for each agent:

- Agent 0's top two items: Item 3 (61), Item 0 (50)
- Agent 1's top two items: Item 0 (94), Item 3 (93)

To achieve envy-freeness, we should focus on giving each agent the items they value highly while ensuring fair distribution of total items.

**Proposed Allocation:**

1. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (since it is highly valued by Agent 1, but not as much by Agent 0 compared to other items).
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (as it is one of the highest valued items for both, but more critical for Agent 0's satisfaction).
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it significantly higher than Agent 0).
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (as it is the least valued, making it a fair compromise).

This allocation ensures:

- Agent 0 gets items they value as much as possible given the constraints.
- Agent 1 gets the items they value the most.
  
The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
