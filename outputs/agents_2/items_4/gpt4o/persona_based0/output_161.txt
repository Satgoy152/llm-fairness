Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3
0  25  33  19  96
1  11  34  41  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Given the valuations, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while distributing the four items.

Let's analyze the situation:

**Agent 0's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 25
- Item 1: 33
- Item 2: 19
- Item 3: 96

**Agent 1's Valuations:**
- Item 0: 11
- Item 1: 34
- Item 2: 41
- Item 3: 41

**Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
- Agent 0: 25 + 33 + 19 + 96 = 173
- Agent 1: 11 + 34 + 41 + 41 = 127

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should consider giving each agent the items they value most, while ensuring the total number of items allocated equals four. One feasible way is to consider the highest valued items for each agent and balance based on their preferences. 

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 3 (96).
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 at 41, which is not their highest valuation.

2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 (41) the same as Item 3, but since Item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, Item 2 is a good alternative.
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 at 19, which is the lowest for them.

3. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 at 34, which is their second-highest after Item 2.
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 33, but since Agent 1 has a slightly higher value and needs more items, it goes to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 at 25.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 at 11, which is their lowest valuation.

With this allocation, each agent receives two items, and the allocation is envy-free based on their valuations.

### Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
