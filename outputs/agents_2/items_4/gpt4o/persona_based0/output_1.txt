Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3
0  28  93  37   6
1  61   4  99  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation. One way to achieve this is by using the "Envy-Free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, which means that any envy can be eliminated by removing at most one item from the envied agent's allocation.

Here's a breakdown of each agent's total valuation for all items:

- **Agent 0's Valuations:**
  - Item 0: 28
  - Item 1: 93
  - Item 2: 37
  - Item 3: 6
  - Total valuation: 28 + 93 + 37 + 6 = 164

- **Agent 1's Valuations:**
  - Item 0: 61
  - Item 1: 4
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 55
  - Total valuation: 61 + 4 + 99 + 55 = 219

Now, let's allocate the items to achieve a fair division:

1. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:** 
   - Agent 0 values this item highly (93), while Agent 1 values it much less (4).

2. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values this item the highest (99), while Agent 0 values it at 37.

3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values this item at 61, while Agent 0 values it at 28.

4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0:**
   - This item has a lower valuation for both agents, but giving it to Agent 0 balances the total perceived value.

Let's check the allocations:

- **Agent 0's Allocation:** Items 1 and 3
  - Total valuation: 93 + 6 = 99

- **Agent 1's Allocation:** Items 0 and 2
  - Total valuation: 61 + 99 = 160

This allocation should be close to envy-free as Agent 0 has a higher value on their top allocated item compared to Agent 1's top item. The total perceived value difference is minimized, and this allocation could be adjusted slightly if we'd like to completely balance the perceived values, but given the constraints of integer item allocations, this is a reasonable and fair division.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
