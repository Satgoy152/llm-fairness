Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  55  50   7
1  69  58  68  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that aims to minimize envy, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on each item. Our goal is to find an allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 61
  - Item 1: 55
  - Item 2: 50
  - Item 3: 7

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 69
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 68
  - Item 3: 81

A possible strategy is to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while also considering the overall sum of their received valuations.

By analyzing the valuations, we can make the following allocations:

1. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, as they place the highest value (81) on it, which is significantly higher than Agent 0's value (7).
2. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it more (69) compared to Agent 0 (61), and Agent 1 already has a highly valued item.
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it relatively high (55) compared to Agent 1 (58) and helps balance the allocation.
4. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it (50) and Agent 1 has already received two highly valued items.

This allocation gives each agent two items and balances the total valuation received by each agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
