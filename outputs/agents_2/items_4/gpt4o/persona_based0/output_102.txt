Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0  90  58  84  48
1  48  77  51  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free division. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation received by the other agent based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations from the table:

- Agent 0's valuations:  
  - Item 0: 90
  - Item 1: 58
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 48

- Agent 1's valuations:  
  - Item 0: 48
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 51
  - Item 3: 85

To achieve a fair division, we look for an allocation where each agent receives the items that maximize their total valuation, given their preferences. A simple method is to maximize the sum of the agents' valuations for the items they receive.

Let's evaluate possible allocations:

1. Allocate items to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring they are satisfied with their allocation compared to the other's.

After evaluating the preferences:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest, so it is reasonable to allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, so it is reasonable to allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- Next, agent 0 has a high valuation for item 2, so it makes sense to allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- Finally, item 1 can be allocated to agent 1.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.

This allocation ensures that both agents receive high-value items according to their preferences, and it is approximately envy-free given the constraints.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
