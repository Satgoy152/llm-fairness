Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  86  84  81
1  55  74  27  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations for the items, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should prefer their allocation or at least value it equally to the allocation of any other agent.

Let's analyze the valuations provided:

- Agent 0's valuations:  
  - Item 0: 89  
  - Item 1: 86  
  - Item 2: 84  
  - Item 3: 81  

- Agent 1's valuations:  
  - Item 0: 55  
  - Item 1: 74  
  - Item 2: 27  
  - Item 3: 59  

We will try to allocate items to maximize the total perceived value for each agent while minimizing envy.

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations are for items 0, 1, 2, and 3 in descending order.**
2. **Agent 1's highest valuations are for items 1, 3, 0, and 2 in descending order.**

To minimize envy and maximize value, consider the following allocation strategy:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it significantly higher than Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as this is Agent 1's top preference and also aligns with their higher valuation.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, since Agent 0 values it much higher than Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it more than Agent 0.

This allocation attempts to balance the values while minimizing potential envy between the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
