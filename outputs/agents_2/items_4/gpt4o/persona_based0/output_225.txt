Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3
0  35  98  21  45
1  38  14  98  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to aim for an allocation that attempts to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a breakdown of the agents' total valuations for all items:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 35
  - Item 1: 98
  - Item 2: 21
  - Item 3: 45
  - **Total Valuation:** 35 + 98 + 21 + 45 = 199

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 38
  - Item 1: 14
  - Item 2: 98
  - Item 3: 84
  - **Total Valuation:** 38 + 14 + 98 + 84 = 234

To achieve a fair allocation, we can consider giving each agent items that maximize their valuation while ensuring that the other agent does not feel envious. A common method to achieve this is to allocate items such that each agent's total value is as close as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations per item:

- **Item 0:**
  - Agent 0: 35
  - Agent 1: 38

- **Item 1:**
  - Agent 0: 98
  - Agent 1: 14

- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 0: 21
  - Agent 1: 98

- **Item 3:**
  - Agent 0: 45
  - Agent 1: 84

Based on these valuations, we can allocate as follows:

1. **Item 1** goes to Agent 0, as they value it significantly higher (98 vs. 14).
2. **Item 2** goes to Agent 1, as they value it significantly higher (98 vs. 21).
3. **Item 3** goes to Agent 1, as they value it higher (84 vs. 45).
4. **Item 0** goes to Agent 0, as it balances the total valuation.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
