Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3
0  23  91  95  51
1  97  79  55  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [97 79 55 56]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, if possible, or at least as fair as possible given the constraints.

### Steps to Fair Allocation:

1. **Valuation Matrix:**
   - Agent 0 values the items as: [23, 91, 95, 51]
   - Agent 1 values the items as: [97, 79, 55, 56]

2. **Total Value Calculation:**
   - Total value for Agent 0: 23 + 91 + 95 + 51 = 260
   - Total value for Agent 1: 97 + 79 + 55 + 56 = 287

3. **Identify Most Preferred Items:**
   - For Agent 0: The order of preference is item 2, 1, 3, 0.
   - For Agent 1: The order of preference is item 0, 1, 3, 2.

4. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by allocating each agent their most preferred item if possible without creating envy.

5. **Allocate Items:**
   - **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 0 (Agent 0's highest value item).
   - **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 1 (Agent 1's highest value item).
   - **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 0. This item is highly valued by both agents, but it is Agent 0's second-highest and Agent 1's second-highest.
   - **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 1. This item is Agent 1's third-highest and Agent 0's fourth-highest.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the allocation is as envy-free as possible while respecting each agent's valuations.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2, with valuations 91 and 95, respectively.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3, with valuations 97 and 56, respectively.

Both agents receive a fair share based on their preferences, and the allocation minimizes potential envy.
