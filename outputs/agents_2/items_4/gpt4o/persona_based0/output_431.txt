Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3
0  65  24  21  50
1   1  27  19  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, meaning that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to the other agent over their own bundle based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

1. Agent 0's total valuation for all items: \(65 + 24 + 21 + 50 = 160\)
2. Agent 1's total valuation for all items: \(1 + 27 + 19 + 22 = 69\)

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent values their own allocation at least equally to the allocation of the other agent.

Let's evaluate potential allocations:

### Possible Allocation Strategy

1. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0's valuation for item 0 is highest at 65.
   - Remaining items: [1, 2, 3]

2. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 1 at 27.
   - Remaining items: [2, 3]

3. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 also values item 2 at 19, which is next highest for them.
   - Remaining item: [3]

4. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 50, which is their second highest after item 0.

### Valuation of Allocations

- **Agent 0's allocation**: Items [0, 3]
  - Total valuation for Agent 0: \(65 + 50 = 115\)

- **Agent 1's allocation**: Items [1, 2]
  - Total valuation for Agent 1: \(27 + 19 = 46\)

### Envy Check

- Agent 0 values their own allocation (115) higher than Agent 1's allocation (valued at 24 by Agent 0).
- Agent 1 values their own allocation (46) higher than Agent 0's allocation (valued at 23 by Agent 1).

Thus, both agents prefer their own allocations over the other's, achieving an envy-free distribution.

### Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
