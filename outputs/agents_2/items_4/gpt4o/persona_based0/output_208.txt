Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  64  54  55
1  35   3  78  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring fairness and minimizing envy. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation received by the other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations for each item:

- Agent 0 values: [8, 64, 54, 55]
- Agent 1 values: [35, 3, 78, 41]

Let's try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values this item the highest (78), compared to Agent 0 (54). Assigning item 2 to Agent 1 reduces the potential for envy from Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item the highest (64), compared to Agent 1 (3). Assigning item 1 to Agent 0 reduces the potential for envy from Agent 0.

3. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item at 55, while Agent 1 values it at 41. Assigning item 3 to Agent 0 gives Agent 0 a higher value and balances the total value received by each agent.

4. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item at 35, compared to Agent 0 who values it at 8. Assigning item 0 to Agent 1 is a reasonable choice considering the previous allocations.

Thus, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 0]

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences and minimizes envy. The total valuations for each agent with these allocations are:

- Agent 0: 64 (Item 1) + 55 (Item 3) = 119
- Agent 1: 78 (Item 2) + 35 (Item 0) = 113

The allocation is fairly balanced given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 0]
}
```
