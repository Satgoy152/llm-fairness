Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3
0  27  26  21  29
1  96  57  87  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we must distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. The key here is to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 27, Item 1 = 26, Item 2 = 21, Item 3 = 29.
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: Item 0 = 96, Item 1 = 57, Item 2 = 87, Item 3 = 53.

A common approach to finding an envy-free allocation is to start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's analyze each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 96, which is higher than Agent 0's 27.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it at 57, which is higher than Agent 0's 26.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 87, which is higher than Agent 0's 21.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 29, which is higher than Agent 1's 53.

Thus, a straightforward allocation would be:

- Assign Items 0, 1, and 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in the following division:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (valued at 29 by Agent 0).
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, and 2 (valued at 96, 57, and 87 by Agent 1, respectively).

Agent 0 receives their highest valued item (Item 3), and Agent 1 receives their highest valued items overall. Since Agent 1 receives the items they value most, and Agent 0 receives the highest valued item for them, both agents are less likely to envy the other.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
