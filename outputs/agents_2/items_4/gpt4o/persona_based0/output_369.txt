Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  30  80  94
1  78  78  47  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as fair as possible based on their valuations. We will use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [87, 30, 80, 94]
- Agent 1: [78, 78, 47, 45]

One approach is to start by assigning the item with the highest value to the agent who values it the most. Let's examine the highest valuations each agent has:

1. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 1 at 45.
2. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 87, Agent 1 at 78.
3. Item 1: Both agents value it equally at 78.
4. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 80, Agent 1 at 47.

Based on this, we can assign:

- Item 3 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest.
- Item 0 to Agent 0, as they also value it more than Agent 1.

Now, assign the remaining items while considering fairness:

- Item 1 can go to Agent 1 since both agents value it equally, and Agent 1 hasn't received any items yet.
- Item 2 will then go to Agent 1, which maximizes their remaining valuation.

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and we have utilized all 4 items.

Here is the fair allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
