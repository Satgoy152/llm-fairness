Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3
0  12  91  63  63
1  18  72  41  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the four items between the two agents such that the allocation is fair and, if possible, envy-free. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

Firstly, let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 12
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 63
  - Item 3: 63

- Agent 1's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 41
  - Item 3: 73

To find a fair allocation, we can start by determining which items each agent values the most and try to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction.

1. Agent 0 highly values Item 1 (91) and Items 2 and 3 equally (63 each).
2. Agent 1 highly values Item 3 (73), and then Item 1 (72).

To create an allocation that is fair and envy-free, we could consider the following allocation:

- Give Agent 0 Item 1 and Item 2.
- Give Agent 1 Item 0 and Item 3.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would get from this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives:
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 63
  - Total: 91 + 63 = 154

- Agent 1 receives:
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 3: 73
  - Total: 18 + 73 = 91

This allocation provides each agent with items they value highly. Agent 0 receives the highest-valued item (Item 1), and Agent 1 receives their most valued item (Item 3).

Now, let's express this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
