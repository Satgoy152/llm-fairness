Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0  66  13  71  54
1  10  74  13  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items between the two agents fairly, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation. This means each agent should feel they have received a fair share of the total value of items, based on their individual valuations.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values:  
  - Item 0: 66  
  - Item 1: 13  
  - Item 2: 71  
  - Item 3: 54
  
- Agent 1 values:  
  - Item 0: 10  
  - Item 1: 74  
  - Item 2: 13  
  - Item 3: 19

To determine a fair allocation, we can use the method of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations:

1. **Identify the most valued item for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (71).
   - Agent 1 values Item 1 the most (74).

2. **Allocate these most valued items to each agent:**
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items to maximize total valuation for each agent:**
   - For Agent 0, the next most valued item is Item 0 (66).
   - For Agent 1, the next most valued item is Item 3 (19).

4. **Ensure all items are allocated:**
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2, with a total valuation of 66 + 71 = 137.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 3, with a total valuation of 74 + 19 = 93.

Both agents receive their most valued item, and the allocation is envy-free since each agent has at least their top-valued item. 

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
