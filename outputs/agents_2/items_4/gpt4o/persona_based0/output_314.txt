Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3
0   1  61  67  39
1  60  22  33   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a manner that is envy-free, I will consider the valuations provided for each item by each agent. The goal is to assign the items such that no agent feels that they would be better off with the allocation of the other agent.

Here are the valuations given:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 61
  - Item 2: 67
  - Item 3: 39

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 22
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 8

To solve this problem, I will analyze the relative preferences of each agent for the items and attempt to minimize any potential envy by considering the sum of the values each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive under a potential allocation and aim to equalize or balance these values as much as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values items 1 and 2 the most.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most.

Given these preferences, consider the following allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2, with total value: 61 + 67 = 128
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3, with total value: 60 + 8 = 68

While this does not completely balance the total values, it respects Agent 1's strong preference for item 0 and gives Agent 0 the items they value the most, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the resulting allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
