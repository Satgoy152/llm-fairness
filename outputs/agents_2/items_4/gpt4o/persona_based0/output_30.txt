Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  64  47  37  16
1  44  81  96  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (Agent 0 and Agent 1), we aim to ensure that neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their valuations. The goal is to find an allocation where each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [64, 47, 37, 16]
- Agent 1's valuations: [44, 81, 96, 90]

One common approach to finding a fair allocation is to try to maximize the minimum satisfaction (or minimize the maximum envy). We can calculate the total value each agent perceives from different allocations and attempt to balance these values.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 2 (Value 96 for Agent 1, 37 for Agent 0):** Assign to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it significantly higher than Agent 0.

2. **Item 3 (Value 90 for Agent 1, 16 for Agent 0):** Assign to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it much higher than Agent 0.

3. **Item 0 (Value 64 for Agent 0, 44 for Agent 1):** Assign to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1.

4. **Item 1 (Value 47 for Agent 0, 81 for Agent 1):** This is a critical item as Agent 1 values it higher, but Agent 0 needs another item. This allocation is more balanced if assigned to Agent 0, as Agent 1 already has high-value items.

### Allocation Result:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value for each agent according to their preferences.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive two items, and the distribution reflects a fair approach to minimizing envy given the valuations.
