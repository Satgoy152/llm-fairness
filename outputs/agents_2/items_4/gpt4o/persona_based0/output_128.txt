Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  71  25  46
1  86  10  85  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we need to take into account the valuations each agent assigns to each item. The goal is to maximize the perceived value each agent receives from their allocated items, ideally ensuring no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuations.

Here are the given valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 71
  - Item 2: 25
  - Item 3: 46

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 86
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 85
  - Item 3: 97

One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, provided this does not result in one agent receiving all the items.

1. Compare valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it more (86 vs. 73).
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it more (71 vs. 10).
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it more (85 vs. 25).
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it more (97 vs. 46).

2. Allocate items based on highest value while ensuring both agents receive items:
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Items 0, 2, and 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation distributes the items such that both agents receive an integer number of items, and Agent 1 receives more items due to higher valuations.

The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated while considering the agents' preferences.
