Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3
0  25  69  86  43
1  73  26  33   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness with integer allocations, we must consider the agents' valuations for each item. The goal is to allocate all four items such that each agent feels they have received their fair share, given their valuations.

First, let's review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 25
  - Item 1: 69
  - Item 2: 86
  - Item 3: 43

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 26
  - Item 2: 33
  - Item 3: 6

To aim for envy-freeness, we should try to maximize each agent's valuation of their allocated items while keeping the allocations balanced. Let's analyze and allocate:

1. **Item 2** has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (86) and a lower valuation for Agent 1 (33). Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 0** has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (73) and a lower valuation for Agent 0 (25). Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Between **Item 1** and **Item 3**, Agent 0 values Item 1 (69) higher than Item 3 (43), and Agent 1 values Item 1 (26) higher than Item 3 (6). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.
4. Since Agent 1 has received one item, we allocate the remaining **Item 3** to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items and maximizes their respective valuations, minimizing envy.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
