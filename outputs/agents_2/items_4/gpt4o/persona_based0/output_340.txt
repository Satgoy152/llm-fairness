Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3
0  13  91  75  83
1  54  48  75  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 48 75 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we look for an allocation where neither agent would prefer the items allocated to the other agent over their own allocation. 

Given the valuation matrix:

```
        Items
        0   1   2   3
Agent 0 13  91  75  83
Agent 1 54  48  75  26
```

We can proceed with the following steps:

1. **Identify the total value each agent assigns to all items:**
   - Agent 0's total valuation: 13 + 91 + 75 + 83 = 262
   - Agent 1's total valuation: 54 + 48 + 75 + 26 = 203

2. **Determine preliminary allocations based on highest individual item valuations:**
   - For Item 0, Agent 1 values it more (54 vs. 13).
   - For Item 1, Agent 0 values it more (91 vs. 48).
   - For Item 2, both agents value it equally (75 vs. 75).
   - For Item 3, Agent 0 values it more (83 vs. 26).

3. **Allocate the items based on the valuations:**
   - Item 0 should go to Agent 1 due to higher valuation.
   - Item 1 should go to Agent 0 due to higher valuation.
   - Item 2 could go to either agent since they value it equally. We'll allocate it to Agent 0 to balance the total valuation.
   - Item 3 should go to Agent 0 due to higher valuation.

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 receives items [1, 2, 3] and Agent 1 receives item [0]. 

Now, let's check for envy-freeness:
- Agent 0's total valuation for their items (1, 2, 3) is 91 + 75 + 83 = 249.
- Agent 1's total valuation for their item (0) is 54.
- Agent 0 values their allocation (249) more than Agent 1's allocation (54).
- Agent 1 values their allocation (54) and doesn't envy Agent 0's allocation (13).

Thus, the allocation is envy-free, and both agents have received items based on their highest valuations without any envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [0]
}
```
