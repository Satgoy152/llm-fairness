Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  10  60  34  36
1  56  96  88  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that envy-freeness is achieved, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that neither feels they would be better off with the other's allocation.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for both agents:

- Agent 0's valuations: 10, 60, 34, 36
- Agent 1's valuations: 56, 96, 88, 66

Now, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: \(10 + 60 + 34 + 36 = 140\)
- Agent 1's total valuation: \(56 + 96 + 88 + 66 = 306\)

The problem asks for an allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, totaling 4 items across both agents. 

We will aim to make the allocation as envy-free as possible by ensuring each agent values their bundle at least as much as the other's.

### Possible Allocation

1. **Allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0's valuation for items 0 and 3 is \(10 + 36 = 46\).
   - Agent 1's valuation for items 0 and 3 is \(56 + 66 = 122\).

2. **Allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 0's valuation for items 1 and 2 is \(60 + 34 = 94\).
   - Agent 1's valuation for items 1 and 2 is \(96 + 88 = 184\).

### Check for Envy-Freeness

- Agent 0 values their allocation (items 0 and 3) at 46.
- Agent 1 values their allocation (items 1 and 2) at 184.

- Agent 0's valuation of Agent 1's allocation is 94.
- Agent 1's valuation of Agent 0's allocation is 122.

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 values their allocation less than Agent 1's allocation, so they might feel envy.
- Agent 1 values their allocation more, hence they are not envious.

Given the constraint to allocate exactly 4 items and the challenge of achieving perfect envy-freeness, this allocation seeks to minimize envy while respecting integer allocation.

    "0": [0, 3],
