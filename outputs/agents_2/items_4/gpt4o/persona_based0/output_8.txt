Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3
0  81  89  89  54
1  79   0  96  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the two agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation that is both envy-free and efficient, to the extent possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Considering the valuations given:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 81
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 89
  - Item 3: 54

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 0
  - Item 2: 96
  - Item 3: 56

Let’s attempt to allocate the items such that both agents are satisfied with their respective allocations.

One possible allocation can be:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is highly valued by them (96) and the highest value item for Agent 1.
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by them (89) and Agent 1 values it at 0.
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by them (81) and Agent 1 values it slightly less (79).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it (56) which is slightly higher than Agent 0’s valuation (54).

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3.

This allocation should minimize envy between the agents given their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
