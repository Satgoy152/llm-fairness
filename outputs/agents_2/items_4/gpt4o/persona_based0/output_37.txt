Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3
0  53  82  78  42
1  77  49  80  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we will aim for an allocation that tries to balance the total value each agent receives, leading to envy-freeness if possible. 

The valuations matrix is as follows:

```
Agent 0: [53, 82, 78, 42]
Agent 1: [77, 49, 80, 12]
```

Firstly, calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 53 + 82 + 78 + 42 = 255
- Agent 1: 77 + 49 + 80 + 12 = 218

Next, consider the items based on highest to lowest valuations for each agent and aim to allocate items such that the total perceived value is balanced between the agents.

Starting with the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (82)
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (80)

Let's allocate these high-value items first:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1

Now, we have:

- Agent 0: [1] with total value 82
- Agent 1: [2] with total value 80

Next, consider remaining items:

- Agent 0 values item 2 next highest (78), but it is already taken.
- Agent 0's next highest is item 0 (53).
- Agent 1 values item 0 next highest (77).

Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 1:

- Agent 0: [1] with total value 82
- Agent 1: [2, 0] with total value 157 (80 + 77)

Finally, allocate the remaining items to balance the total value:

- Agent 0 takes item 3 (42).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 3] with total value 124 (82 + 42)
- Agent 1: [2, 0] with total value 157

This allocation minimizes envy and balances the total value.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 0]
}
```
