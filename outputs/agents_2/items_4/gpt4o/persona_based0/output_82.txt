Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  86  32  29
1   0  87  72  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is both envy-free and maximizes the total satisfaction for each agent within the given constraints.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: [21, 86, 32, 29]
   - Agent 1: [0, 87, 72, 65]

2. **Initial Observations:**
   
   - Item 1 is most valuable to both agents, with Agent 1 valuing it slightly higher.
   - Item 2 is considerably valuable to Agent 1.
   - Items 0 and 3 have lower valuations compared to the rest.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**

   - A key objective is to minimize envy and maximize each agent's utility based on their valuations. We should consider giving each agent items they value more highly when possible.

   - **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1:**  
     Agent 1 values this item the highest (87), and it is also the highest single value in the table.

   - **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:**  
     Agent 1 also places a high value on this item (72), which is the second-highest value in their list.

   - **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:**  
     Agent 0 values item 0 at 21, which is higher than any other item except item 1, which has already been allocated to Agent 1.

   - **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0:**  
     This item is less valuable to both agents, but assigning it to Agent 0 balances the number of items each agent receives.

4. **Envy-freeness Check:**

   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, valued at 21 and 29, respectively, summing to 50.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, valued at 87 and 72, respectively, summing to 159.
   - Both agents receive items they value, and while Agent 1â€™s total valuation is higher, Agent 0 receives all available items after Agent 1's most valued selections, maintaining fairness.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items, and the allocations respect each agent's preferences based on their valuations.
