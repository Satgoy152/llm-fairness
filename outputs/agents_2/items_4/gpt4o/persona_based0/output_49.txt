Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  96  97  28
1  59  35  80   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we need to aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent believes that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation given to the other agent, based on their own valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 8
  - Item 1: 96
  - Item 2: 97
  - Item 3: 28

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 80
  - Item 3: 2

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's utility while minimizing potential envy. One common approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the sum of the minimum utility each agent can receive from their allocation.

Let's consider some potential allocations and check their fairness:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
   - Agent 1: Items 0 and 2
   
   Valuation:
   - For Agent 0: \(96 + 28 = 124\)
   - For Agent 1: \(59 + 80 = 139\)

   This allocation is not envy-free because Agent 0 might feel envious of Agent 1's total valuation.

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
   - Agent 1: Items 0 and 1
   
   Valuation:
   - For Agent 0: \(97 + 28 = 125\)
   - For Agent 1: \(59 + 35 = 94\)

   This allocation might be considered fair from Agent 1's perspective, as they receive less utility than Agent 0.

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0: Items 1 and 2
   - Agent 1: Items 0 and 3
   
   Valuation:
   - For Agent 0: \(96 + 97 = 193\)
   - For Agent 1: \(59 + 2 = 61\)

   This allocation is highly imbalanced and not fair for Agent 1.

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle that they value as much as possible without envying the other's allocation. Based on the calculations, Allocation 2 seems to be the most balanced option:

- Agent 0 receives items with valuations \(97 + 28 = 125\).
- Agent 1 receives items with valuations \(59 + 35 = 94\).

Although not perfectly equal, this allocation respects the agents' preferences more closely than the other options and minimizes potential envy given their strong preference differences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
