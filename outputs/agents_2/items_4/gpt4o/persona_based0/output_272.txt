Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  18  30  36  47
1  93  59  60   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that minimizes envy, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to find an allocation where each agent feels they have received items worth at least as much as what they perceive in the other agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 18
  - Item 1: 30
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 47

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 59
  - Item 2: 60
  - Item 3: 4

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's perceived value while minimizing potential envy. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** should receive items that they value more compared to Agent 1's valuations. Based on the valuations, Agent 0 gets:
   - Item 2 (value for Agent 0: 36, value for Agent 1: 60)
   - Item 3 (value for Agent 0: 47, value for Agent 1: 4)

2. **Agent 1** should receive the remaining items:
   - Item 0 (value for Agent 1: 93, value for Agent 0: 18)
   - Item 1 (value for Agent 1: 59, value for Agent 0: 30)

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value for each agent, giving Agent 0 the items they value most highly, and giving Agent 1 the items they value most highly. This setup minimizes envy because each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly based on their own preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
