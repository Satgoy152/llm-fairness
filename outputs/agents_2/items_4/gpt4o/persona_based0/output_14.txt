Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3
0  67  79   0  16
1  77  53  32   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness as well as the valuations each agent has for the items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

The table given is:

```
       0   1   2   3
Agent 0: 67  79   0  16
Agent 1: 77  53  32   9
```

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total value: 67 + 79 + 0 + 16 = 162
- Agent 1's total value: 77 + 53 + 32 + 9 = 171

Now, let's try to allocate the items such that each agent gets items they value highly, aiming for an envy-free allocation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 67
   - Agent 1 values it at 77
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 79
   - Agent 1 values it at 53
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 0
   - Agent 1 values it at 32
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (higher value)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 16
   - Agent 1 values it at 9
   - Allocate to Agent 0 (higher value)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value most, providing a fair division:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3. The total value for Agent 0 is 79 + 16 = 95.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2. The total value for Agent 1 is 77 + 32 = 109.

This allocation minimizes envy since each agent receives items they value more than the other agent does. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
