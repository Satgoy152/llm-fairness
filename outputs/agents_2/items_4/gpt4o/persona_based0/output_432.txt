Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3
0  59  84  57  70
1  46  11  84  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents with the goal of minimizing envy and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. We aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close as possible given the constraints.

Let's evaluate the total valuations for each item by each agent:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 84
  - Item 2: 57
  - Item 3: 70

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 46
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 84
  - Item 3: 62

To achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify each agent's highest valued items:**
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 the highest (84).
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (84).

2. **Assign each agent their most valued item whenever possible:**
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate the remaining items based on remaining preferences:**
   - Remaining items: Item 0 and Item 3.
   - Agent 0's next highest preference is Item 3 (70).
   - Agent 1's next highest preference is Item 3 (62).

   Since Agent 0 values Item 3 more than Agent 1, assign Item 3 to Agent 0.

4. **Allocate the last remaining item:**
   - Item 0 is left, and it should go to Agent 1.

This allocation strategy maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences and ensures a fair division of items. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and at least 4 items are allocated in total.
