Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  38  83   9
1  85  29  71  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution as much as possible. We have two agents and four items, and we need to allocate all items such that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the valuation matrix again for reference:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 21 | 38 | 83 | 9  |
| 1          | 85 | 29 | 71 | 40 |

To approach this problem, we will follow a strategic approach:

1. **Highest Valuation Method**: Allocate items based on the highest valuation by each agent, ensuring we consider the best possible distribution to minimize envy.

2. **Check Envy-freeness**: Verify that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent.

### Allocation Process

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 2** has the highest valuation for Agent 0 at 83 and Agent 1 at 71. To maximize fairness, we assign Item 2 to Agent 0, who values it higher.

- **Item 0** is highly valued by Agent 1 at 85, which is the highest single valuation across all items. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

- **Item 1** is valued at 38 by Agent 0 and 29 by Agent 1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0, who values it higher.

- **Item 3** is valued at 40 by Agent 1 and 9 by Agent 0. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, who values it higher.

### Final Allocation

After allocating all items considering the above steps, the distribution is as follows:

- **Agent 0** receives items 2 and 1
- **Agent 1** receives items 0 and 3

### Allocations in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the initial valuations.
