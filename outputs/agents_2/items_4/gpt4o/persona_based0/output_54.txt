Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  13  81  37  14
1  33  38  50  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to minimize envy. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

We have the following valuations:

- Agent 0: [13, 81, 37, 14]
- Agent 1: [33, 38, 50, 79]

A fair allocation involves distributing the items such that each agent receives items they highly value and the distribution minimizes envy.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 0 (81) and moderately by Agent 1 (38). It makes sense to give Item 1 to Agent 0 since it maximizes their utility significantly.

2. Item 3 is highly valued by Agent 1 (79) compared to Agent 0 (14). Giving Item 3 to Agent 1 maximizes their utility.

3. Item 2 has a higher valuation by Agent 1 (50) than Agent 0 (37). It makes sense to give Item 2 to Agent 1 to respect their higher valuation.

4. Item 0 has a higher valuation by Agent 1 (33) than Agent 0 (13). However, since Agent 0 has only one item so far, and to balance the allocation, we should give Item 0 to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets Items 2 and 3.

This distribution aims to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
