Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3
0  46  93  40  21
1  58  55  37   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and ensure envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility given their preferences, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations**: 
   - Item 0: 46
   - Item 1: 93
   - Item 2: 40
   - Item 3: 21

2. **Agent 1's Valuations**:
   - Item 0: 58
   - Item 1: 55
   - Item 2: 37
   - Item 3: 2

### Allocation Strategy

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to distribute the items such that the total value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible. In this case, we can proceed as follows:

1. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 highly values item 1 (93), which greatly increases their perceived utility.

2. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (58), so giving it to them maximizes their utility.

3. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0**: 
   - After assigning item 1 to Agent 0, giving item 2 to Agent 0 (40) maintains balance, as Agent 1 has already received a high-value item.

4. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1**:
   - This is the least valued item for both agents, and Agent 1 has a lower total value after the first item allocation. Assigning this item to Agent 1 helps balance the total perceived utility.

### Final Allocations

The allocation ensures each agent has at least one item and the total valuation is balanced as much as possible given the constraints. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 items 1 and 2, while Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.
