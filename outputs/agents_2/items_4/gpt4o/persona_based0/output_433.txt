Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  74  67   0
1  66  10  42  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the two agents, we should aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives a set of items that is as valuable as possible based on their individual valuations. 

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 61
  - Item 1: 74
  - Item 2: 67
  - Item 3: 0

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 66
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 42
  - Item 3: 32

A simple approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the total value each agent receives while trying to balance the allocations.

Here are a few possible allocations with their respective total values for each agent:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
     - Total Value: 61 + 74 = 135
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 3]
     - Total Value: 42 + 32 = 74

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
     - Total Value: 74 + 67 = 141
   - Agent 1: Items [0, 3]
     - Total Value: 66 + 32 = 98

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
     - Total Value: 61 + 0 = 61
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 2]
     - Total Value: 10 + 42 = 52

Among these, Allocation 2 seems to provide a more balanced value distribution while keeping each agent's total value as high as possible. Thus, we will choose Allocation 2.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
