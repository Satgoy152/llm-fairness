Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3
0  75   4  77  56
1  56  96  30  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75  4 77 56]
 [56 96 30 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close as possible to being envy-free, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items while ensuring that the allocation appears fair.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3
0  75   4  77  56
1  56  96  30  83
```

We can compute possible allocations, taking into account the following:

1. **Agent 0** values items 0 and 2 significantly more than the others.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest, followed by item 3.

A reasonable approach would be to allocate items to maximize the sum of each agent's valuations for their own items while attempting to balance perceived fairness.

**Allocation Strategy**:
1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their most valued item.
2. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it is highly valued by them.
3. Now, consider item 2, which is highly valued by Agent 0 but not as much by Agent 1, so allocate it to Agent 0.
4. Finally, allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it is the next highest valued item for them after item 1.

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, reducing the potential for envy.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, which they value at 75 and 77, respectively. Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3, which they value at 96 and 83, respectively. This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while respecting their preferences.
