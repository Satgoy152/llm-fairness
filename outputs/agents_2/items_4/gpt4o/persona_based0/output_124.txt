Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3
0  99  32  57  96
1  24  85  55   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that they received as much value as the other agent considering their own valuation.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [99, 32, 57, 96]
- Agent 1's valuations: [24, 85, 55, 6]

Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent has a fair share in terms of their perceived value. To achieve this, we can try to balance the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Assign Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 99.
   - Agent 1 values it at 24.
   - Agent 0 has a much higher valuation for Item 0, so we assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Assign Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 32.
   - Agent 1 values it at 85.
   - Agent 1 has a higher valuation for Item 1, so we assign Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Assign Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 57.
   - Agent 1 values it at 55.
   - The valuations are close, but to balance the allocation so far, we assign Item 2 to Agent 0. This keeps the value proportions closer to fairness given Agent 0â€™s larger value from Item 0.

4. **Assign Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 96.
   - Agent 1 values it at 6.
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 significantly higher, but since Agent 1 has a low total value so far, we assign Item 3 to Agent 1 to balance the overall allocation.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 3.

This allocation tries to ensure that both agents receive a fair share based on their own valuations, aiming for a balance in perceived total value.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
