Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  91  21  47  76
1  13  87  45   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 4 items between the 2 agents such that the distribution is fair and envy-free. Envy-freeness in this context means that each agent should have no incentive to swap their allocation with the other agent, given their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [91, 21, 47, 76]
- Agent 1's valuations: [13, 87, 45, 1]

One approach to achieve a fair and envy-free allocation is to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 highly (91) and item 3 (76).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highly (87) and item 2 (45).

2. **Initial allocation based on high valuations**:
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it provides significant value for them.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it provides significant value for them.

3. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - After the initial allocation, we have items 2 and 3 left.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 because they value it significantly more than Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 because they value it significantly more than Agent 1.

This allocation provides each agent with items that maximize their individual valuations and should prevent envy since each agent is receiving items they value highly.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations.
