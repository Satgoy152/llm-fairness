Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3
0  60  51   4  17
1  83  76  21  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the two agents, we will aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible. In this scenario, we can use the strategy of maximizing each agent's total value from the items they receive while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive for different allocations and find a fair distribution:

### Agent 0 Valuations:
- Item 0: 60
- Item 1: 51
- Item 2: 4
- Item 3: 17

### Agent 1 Valuations:
- Item 0: 83
- Item 1: 76
- Item 2: 21
- Item 3: 48

### Possible Allocations:

1. **Allocation 1**:
   - Agent 0 receives items [0, 3]
   - Agent 1 receives items [1, 2]

   **Valuations**:
   - Agent 0: 60 + 17 = 77
   - Agent 1: 76 + 21 = 97

2. **Allocation 2**:
   - Agent 0 receives items [1, 2]
   - Agent 1 receives items [0, 3]

   **Valuations**:
   - Agent 0: 51 + 4 = 55
   - Agent 1: 83 + 48 = 131

3. **Allocation 3**:
   - Agent 0 receives items [0, 1]
   - Agent 1 receives items [2, 3]

   **Valuations**:
   - Agent 0: 60 + 51 = 111
   - Agent 1: 21 + 48 = 69

4. **Allocation 4**:
   - Agent 0 receives items [1, 3]
   - Agent 1 receives items [0, 2]

   **Valuations**:
   - Agent 0: 51 + 17 = 68
   - Agent 1: 83 + 21 = 104

We'll aim to minimize the difference in total valuations between the two agents. Allocation 3 appears to be the best option, as it offers a balance where both agents' valuations are closest.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 111 and Agent 1 a total value of 69, which minimizes the difference and provides a reasonable distribution of items based on their valuations.
