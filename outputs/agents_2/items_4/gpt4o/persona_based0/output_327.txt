Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  71  57  54   5
1  57  19  85  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and aim for an envy-free distribution, if possible. This means each agent should be at least as happy with their allocation as with any other agent's allocation.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows:  
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 57
  - Item 2: 54
  - Item 3: 5

- Agent 1 values items as follows:
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 85
  - Item 3: 26

To find a fair allocation, we can try maximizing each agent's total satisfaction while ensuring no agent envies the other.

### Possible Allocation Strategy

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1:**  
   - Agent 1 values this item the most (85), and it is the highest valued item for them.

2. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values this item the most (71), and it is their highest valued item.

3. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 values this item more (57) compared to agent 1 (19).

4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 values this item more (26) compared to agent 0 (5).

### Total Valuations After Allocation
- **Agent 0:**
  - Items 0 and 1: 71 + 57 = 128
- **Agent 1:**
  - Items 2 and 3: 85 + 26 = 111

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items they value highly, minimizing the potential for envy.

### Final Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation is fair given the constraint that each agent must receive at least one item, and it balances the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations.
