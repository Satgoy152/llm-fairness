Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  48  34  23   0
1   4  37  36  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items such that their perceived value from their allocation is as balanced as possible. One approach to achieve fairness, particularly envy-freeness, is to look for allocations where each agent values their own bundle at least as much as the bundle of any other agent. Given the valuations:

Agent 0 values:  
- Item 0: 48  
- Item 1: 34  
- Item 2: 23  
- Item 3: 0  

Agent 1 values:  
- Item 0: 4  
- Item 1: 37  
- Item 2: 36  
- Item 3: 87  

We can analyze the values to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: They have higher valuation for items 0 and 1 compared to Agent 1, and Agent 0 values item 3 the least (0), which Agent 1 values the most (87).
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 3 and somewhat values items 1 and 2 more than Agent 0 does.

**Proposed Allocation**:

- Assign **Agent 0** items 0 and 1.
- Assign **Agent 1** items 2 and 3.

**Justification**:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1, which they value at 48 and 34 respectively, totaling 82.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 3, which they value at 36 and 87 respectively, totaling 123.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and the distribution is fair because each agent values their own bundle at least as much (if not more) than they would value the bundle of the other agent. 

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
