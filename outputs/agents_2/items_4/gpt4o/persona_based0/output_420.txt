Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3
0  82  64  17  75
1  37  68  56  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82 64 17 75]
 [37 68 56 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they receive their fair share based on their valuations.

### Valuations Table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 82     | 64     | 17     | 75     |
| 1     | 37     | 68     | 56     | 39     |

### Total Valuations:

- **Agent 0 Total Valuation:** 82 + 64 + 17 + 75 = 238
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation:** 37 + 68 + 56 + 39 = 200

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Item 0:** Assign to Agent 0 for 82 (Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1).
2. **Item 1:** Assign to Agent 1 for 68 (Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0).
3. **Item 2:** Assign to Agent 1 for 56 (Agent 1 values it higher than Agent 0).
4. **Item 3:** Assign to Agent 0 for 75 (Agent 0 values it higher than Agent 1).

### Final Allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0 and 3
- **Agent 1:** Items 1 and 2

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly compared to the other agent, aiming to minimize envy.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
