Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0   9  39  82  90
1  48  97   8  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we will aim to find an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [9, 39, 82, 90]
- Agent 1: [48, 97, 8, 16]

To find a fair allocation, we can calculate the total value each agent derives from possible allocations and adjust to minimize envy. Let's explore a potential allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

Let's evaluate the proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [3, 2] with a total value of 90 + 82 = 172.
- Agent 1 receives items [0, 1] with a total value of 48 + 97 = 145.

Both agents receive an allocation that respects their valuations, and the allocation minimizes the difference in the total value between agents. Importantly, neither agent envies the other because each values their own allocation more highly than the other's.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
