Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3
0  63  52  71  82
1  66  53  17   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free division. An allocation is envy-free if each agent feels that they received items at least as valuable as the items received by the other agent according to their own valuations.

Let's first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- **Agent 0**: 63 (item 0) + 52 (item 1) + 71 (item 2) + 82 (item 3) = 268
- **Agent 1**: 66 (item 0) + 53 (item 1) + 17 (item 2) + 1 (item 3) = 137

To achieve a fair division, we'll look for an allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share of the total value. One simple method to achieve this is to satisfy the condition that each agent should get a total value of at least half of their maximum possible total value. 

We'll attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's valuation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (82) and item 2 (71).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (66) and item 1 (53).

Let's allocate based on the highest value each agent assigns to the items:

- Assign item 3 and item 2 to **Agent 0**, as they highly value these items.
- Assign item 0 and item 1 to **Agent 1**, as they highly value these items.

Let's check the total valuation for each agent after allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 82 (item 3) + 71 (item 2) = 153
- **Agent 1**: 66 (item 0) + 53 (item 1) = 119

Both agents have received items that they value highly, and the allocation is envy-free because neither agent values the other's allocation more than their own.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
