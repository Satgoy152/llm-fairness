Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3
0  53  92  19  53
1  77  64   8  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Here are the valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0 values: [53, 92, 19, 53]
- Agent 1 values: [77, 64, 8, 88]

One effective approach is to use the "maximin" strategy, where we try to maximize the minimum value each agent receives.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive under different allocations and choose the one that minimizes envy:

1. **Allocation 1:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: [0, 2]
     - Value: 53 + 19 = 72
   - Agent 1 receives items: [1, 3]
     - Value: 64 + 88 = 152

2. **Allocation 2:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: [1, 2]
     - Value: 92 + 19 = 111
   - Agent 1 receives items: [0, 3]
     - Value: 77 + 88 = 165

3. **Allocation 3:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: [0, 3]
     - Value: 53 + 53 = 106
   - Agent 1 receives items: [1, 2]
     - Value: 64 + 8 = 72

4. **Allocation 4:**
   - Agent 0 receives items: [1, 3]
     - Value: 92 + 53 = 145
   - Agent 1 receives items: [0, 2]
     - Value: 77 + 8 = 85

After reviewing these allocations, Allocation 4 seems to provide a fair balance, as both agents receive a relatively high value. In this allocation, no agent has a strong preference for the other agent's allocation over their own.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
