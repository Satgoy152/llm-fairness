Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  37  20  78
1  34  52  88  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent perceives their allocated set of items as being at least as valuable as the other agent's allocation.

Let's start by examining the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [36, 37, 20, 78]
- Agent 1's valuations: [34, 52, 88, 86]

A potential allocation is to maximize each agent's perceived value while maintaining envy-freeness. Let's consider possible allocations:

1. **Allocate item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item at 78, which is their highest valuation.
2. **Allocate item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item at 88, which is their highest valuation.
3. **Allocate item 1 to Agent 1**: This item is valued at 52 by Agent 1, and at 37 by Agent 0. Giving this to Agent 1 maintains a high total value for them.
4. **Allocate item 0 to Agent 0**: This item is valued at 36 by Agent 0, which is better than Agent 1's valuation of 34, and it balances the allocation.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- **Agent 0's allocation**: Items 3 and 0, total valuation = 78 + 36 = 114.
- **Agent 1's allocation**: Items 2 and 1, total valuation = 88 + 52 = 140.

This allocation is envy-free because each agent receives a bundle that they value as high as possible given the other's allocation. Agent 0 cannot claim to prefer Agent 1's bundle over their own, and vice versa.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 1]
}
```
