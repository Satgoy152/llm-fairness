Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1  2   3
0  60  89  7  80
1  14  35  3  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their own valuations.

The given valuations are:

- Agent 0's valuations:
  - Item 0: 60
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 7
  - Item 3: 80

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 14
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 3
  - Item 3: 38

Our goal is to allocate these items in a way that balances the total perceived value for each agent. Let's consider the total value each agent places on all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 60 + 89 + 7 + 80 = 236
- Total value for Agent 1: 14 + 35 + 3 + 38 = 90

To ensure a fair allocation, we should distribute the items such that each agent gets as close as possible to half of their total value. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0. This item has the highest value for Agent 0.
2. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1. This item has the highest value for Agent 1.
3. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0. This item has the second highest value for Agent 0.
4. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1. This item completes the allocation for Agent 1.

Now, let's check the perceived total value for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1: 60 + 89 = 149
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3: 3 + 38 = 41

This allocation ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their own valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
