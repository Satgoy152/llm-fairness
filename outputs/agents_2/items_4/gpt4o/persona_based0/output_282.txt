Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1  2   3
0  49  16  5  69
1  81  32  0   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly distribute the items between the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. Here's a breakdown of their valuations:

- **Agent 0**:  
  - Item 0: 49  
  - Item 1: 16  
  - Item 2: 5  
  - Item 3: 69  

- **Agent 1**:  
  - Item 0: 81  
  - Item 1: 32  
  - Item 2: 0  
  - Item 3: 0  

Given these valuations, we can attempt to allocate items by considering each agent's preferences, so that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has a high preference for Item 0 with a valuation of 81, whereas **Agent 0** values it at 49. So, it makes sense to allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 0** highly values Item 3 with 69, while **Agent 1** values it at 0. Thus, Item 3 should be allocated to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 1** values Item 1 at 32, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 16. Therefore, Item 1 should be allocated to Agent 1.

4. Finally, **Agent 0** values Item 2 at 5, while Agent 1 values it at 0. Hence, Item 2 should be allocated to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively higher than the other agent, aiming to minimize envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
