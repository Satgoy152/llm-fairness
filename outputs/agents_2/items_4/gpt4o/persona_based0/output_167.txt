Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3
0  77  99  91  50
1  80  79   2  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as that of the other agent.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 77
  - Item 1: 99
  - Item 2: 91
  - Item 3: 50

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 80
  - Item 1: 79
  - Item 2: 2
  - Item 3: 76

A reasonable strategy is to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Let's explore a fair distribution:

1. **Greedy Allocation:**
   - First, rank the items based on the differences in valuations between the two agents to prioritize items that have the highest disparity in valuation between the agents.
   - Allocate the highest valued item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Calculate the Total Valuation:**
   - For Agent 0:
     - Sum of valuations for all items: 77 + 99 + 91 + 50 = 317
   - For Agent 1:
     - Sum of valuations for all items: 80 + 79 + 2 + 76 = 237

3. **Allocation:**
   - Start by allocating items greedily to maximize each agent's perceived value:

   - Item 1 is most valued by Agent 0 (99 vs. 79); allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 2 is less valued by Agent 0 (91 vs. 2); allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 0 is highly valued by both, but slightly more by Agent 1 (80 vs. 77); allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3 is a higher value for Agent 1 (76 vs. 50); allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.

This allocation ensures each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their valuations. Both agents receive two items, fulfilling the integer allocation requirement.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
