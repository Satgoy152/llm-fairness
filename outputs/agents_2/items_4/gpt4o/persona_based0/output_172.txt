Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3
0  74  90  20  12
1  79   0  83  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [79  0 83 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: [74, 90, 20, 12]
- Agent 1 values items as follows: [79, 0, 83, 30]

Let's start by assigning the items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it at 90, and Agent 1 values it at 0. Therefore, assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it at 83, and Agent 0 values it at 20. Therefore, assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it at 79, and Agent 0 values it at 74. Therefore, assign Item 0 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it at 12, and Agent 1 values it at 30. Therefore, assign Item 3 to Agent 1.

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Item 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0, 2, and 3.

Finally, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest valuations, thus moving towards a fair distribution.
