Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3
0  98  97  70  38
1   3  55  21  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we must allocate the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. This is a challenging problem, especially with integer allocations, but we can aim for a fair distribution based on maximizing each agent's total value.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 (98), Item 1 (97), Item 2 (70), Item 3 (38)
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 (3), Item 1 (55), Item 2 (21), Item 3 (93)

We need to allocate the 4 items between the two agents.

Let's consider the possible allocations:

1. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 and Item 3 to Agent 1. These are the items they value the most.
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it significantly more than Agent 1 does.
3. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1, as it brings a better balance in the distribution of value for both agents.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 1]
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 3]

Valuations would be:

- Agent 0: 98 (from Item 0) + 97 (from Item 1) = 195
- Agent 1: 21 (from Item 2) + 93 (from Item 3) = 114

This allocation does not leave any agent feeling envious of the other, as each received items they highly valued over the other items they could have received. It also ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their individual preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
