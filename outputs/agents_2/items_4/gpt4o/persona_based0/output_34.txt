Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3
0  70   5  96   9
1  99  24  90  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to minimize envy while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: Item 0 at 70, Item 1 at 5, Item 2 at 96, Item 3 at 9
- Agent 1 values: Item 0 at 99, Item 1 at 24, Item 2 at 90, Item 3 at 14

A reasonable approach is to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations, ensuring that the allocations are envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (96)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 0 (70)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (99)
   - Second highest valuation: Item 2 (90)

Given that both agents highly value Item 0 and Item 2, we should allocate these items strategically to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring fairness:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it the most.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 values it the most.

Now, for the remaining items (Item 1 and Item 3):

- Agent 0 has a low valuation for Item 1 (5) and Item 3 (9).
- Agent 1 values Item 1 at 24 and Item 3 at 14.

To distribute the remaining items:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (valuation of 24 compared to Agent 0’s 5).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (valuation of 9 compared to Agent 1’s 14).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the overall satisfaction and reduce envy, given the constraints of integer allocations.
