Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3
0  30   3  66  76
1  34  31  64  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences, while also ensuring envy-freeness if possible. An envy-free allocation means no agent would prefer the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the valuation table:

```
Agent 0 valuations:
Item 0: 30
Item 1: 3 
Item 2: 66
Item 3: 76

Agent 1 valuations:
Item 0: 34
Item 1: 31
Item 2: 64
Item 3: 89
```

To allocate items, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Item 3**: Highest total value across both agents (76 + 89 = 165)
   - Assign to Agent 1 (the agent with the highest valuation for this item).

2. **Item 2**: Second highest total value (66 + 64 = 130)
   - Assign to Agent 0 (the agent with the highest valuation for this item).

3. **Item 0**: Third highest total value (30 + 34 = 64)
   - Assign to Agent 1 (the agent with the highest valuation for this item).

4. **Item 1**: Lowest total value (3 + 31 = 34)
   - Assign to Agent 1 (the only remaining item).

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, and 3

Agent 0 gets their highest-valued item (Item 2). Agent 1 receives the remaining items, and they receive their highest-valued item (Item 3).

This allocation is envy-free because:
- Agent 0 receives Item 2, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0, 1, and 3, which they value as a whole higher than any other possible combination.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
