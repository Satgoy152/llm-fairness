Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3
0  16  88  56  45
1  36  35  44  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:  
- Item 0: 16
- Item 1: 88
- Item 2: 56
- Item 3: 45

Agent 1's valuations:  
- Item 0: 36
- Item 1: 35
- Item 2: 44
- Item 3: 40

To achieve a fair division, we can use the following strategy:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation for Agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it has the highest valuation for Agent 1.
3. Consider the remaining items (2 and 3).

Agent 0's remaining valuations:
- Item 2: 56
- Item 3: 45

Agent 1's remaining valuations:
- Item 2: 44
- Item 3: 40

4. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it higher than item 3.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as it's the only remaining item.

Now, both agents have received two items each, and no agent envies the other's allocation given their own valuations.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
