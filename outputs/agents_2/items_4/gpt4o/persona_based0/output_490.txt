Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0   0  24  73  41
1  82  35  94  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will try to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, meaning that each agent should feel that their share is at least as good as the other agent's share given their own valuation.

First, let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 0
  - Item 1: 24
  - Item 2: 73
  - Item 3: 41

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 82
  - Item 1: 35
  - Item 2: 94
  - Item 3: 19

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 0 + 24 + 73 + 41 = 138
- Total value for Agent 1 = 82 + 35 + 94 + 19 = 230

Next, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent's total value from their allocated items is maximized and as close as possible to half of their total value.

We can try the following allocation:

1. Assign item 2 to Agent 0:
   - Value for Agent 0 = 73
   - Value for Agent 1 = 94

2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1:
   - Value for Agent 0 = 0
   - Value for Agent 1 = 82

3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1:
   - Value for Agent 0 = 24
   - Value for Agent 1 = 35

4. Assign item 3 to Agent 0:
   - Value for Agent 0 = 41
   - Value for Agent 1 = 19

This allocation results in:

- Total value for Agent 0 = 73 + 41 = 114
- Total value for Agent 1 = 82 + 35 + 19 = 136

Both agents receive a substantial share of their total valuation, and this allocation is envy-free:

- Agent 0 has items 2 and 3, and values them at 114, which is greater than or equal to their valuation of what Agent 1 has (items 0 and 1, valued at 24).
- Agent 1 has items 0 and 1, and values them at 117, which is greater than or equal to their valuation of what Agent 0 has (items 2 and 3, valued at 60).

Finally, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
