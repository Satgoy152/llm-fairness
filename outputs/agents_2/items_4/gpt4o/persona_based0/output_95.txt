Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  20  23  91  77
1  30  60  94  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [30 60 94 84]]
Output:
To ensure a fair division of items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ideally achieving an envy-free allocation if possible. Envy-freeness is achieved when each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [20, 23, 91, 77]
- Agent 1's valuations: [30, 60, 94, 84]

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - For Agent 0, the highest-valued items are item 2 (91) and item 3 (77).
   - For Agent 1, the highest-valued items are item 2 (94) and item 3 (84).

2. **Directly allocate the highest valued item to each agent:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 2 (91).
   - Agent 1 receives item 3 (84).

3. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Remaining items are item 0 and item 1.

4. **Consider remaining valuations:**
   - For Agent 0: item 0 (20), item 1 (23).
   - For Agent 1: item 0 (30), item 1 (60).

5. **Allocate remaining items by comparing valuations:**
   - Agent 0 receives item 1 (23).
   - Agent 1 receives item 0 (30).

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 1]
- Agent 1: [3, 0]

This allocation prioritizes giving each agent their highest valued item first and then fairly allocating the remaining items based on the next highest valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 0]
}
```
