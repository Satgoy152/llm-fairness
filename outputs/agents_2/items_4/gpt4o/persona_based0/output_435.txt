Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  86   8   8  68
1   5  94  94  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86  8  8 68]
 [ 5 94 94 20]]
Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of items between the two agents, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other allocation they could receive, based on their own valuations.

Here's the valuation matrix for reference:

```
      Item
     0   1   2   3
-------------------
0 | 86   8   8  68
1 |  5  94  94  20
```

**Step-by-step allocation process:**

1. **Agent 0's Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (86), followed by item 3 (68).
   - Their least valued items are 1 and 2, each valued at 8.

2. **Agent 1's Preferences:**
   - Agent 1 values items 1 and 2 the highest (each at 94).
   - Their least valued items are 0 and 3, valued at 5 and 20, respectively.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** To maximize their perceived value, we allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0, as these have the highest valuations for them (86 and 68, respectively).

- **Agent 1:** To maximize Agent 1's perceived value, we allocate items 1 and 2 to Agent 1, as these are highly valued by them (each valued at 94).

This allocation ensures:
- Agent 0 receives items valued at 86 + 68 = 154.
- Agent 1 receives items valued at 94 + 94 = 188.

Both agents receive their most valued items, ensuring that neither agent envies the other's allocation based on their own valuations.

**Final Allocation in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
