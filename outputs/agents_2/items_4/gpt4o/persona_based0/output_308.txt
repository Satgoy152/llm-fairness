Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3
0  51  52  71  35
1  93  69  54  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness is achieved when each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent according to their own valuation.

Let's consider the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0: [51, 52, 71, 35]
- Agent 1: [93, 69, 54, 51]

We need to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their bundle given their valuations.

Letâ€™s first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 51 + 52 + 71 + 35 = 209
- Total value for Agent 1: 93 + 69 + 54 + 51 = 267

To minimize envy, we can consider the highest-valued items for each agent and attempt to allocate them in a way that balances the satisfaction across the agents. 

Let's try the following allocation:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (value 93 for Agent 1, 51 for Agent 0).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (value 69 for Agent 1, 52 for Agent 0).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (value 71 for Agent 0, 54 for Agent 1).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (value 35 for Agent 0, 51 for Agent 1).

Now, let's check the total valuation for each agent based on these allocations:

- Agent 0's total value: 71 (item 2) + 35 (item 3) = 106
- Agent 1's total value: 93 (item 0) + 69 (item 1) = 162

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and all items are distributed. It also attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
