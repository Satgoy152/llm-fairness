Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3
0  73  40  63  53
1  74  65  89  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we should aim to ensure that neither agent feels that the other agent has received a better allocation based on their own valuations.

Firstly, let's review the valuations:

- **Agent 0:**
  - Item 0: 73
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 63
  - Item 3: 53

- **Agent 1:**
  - Item 0: 74
  - Item 1: 65
  - Item 2: 89
  - Item 3: 39

To determine a fair allocation, we can use the "maximum sum of values" approach to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, while also maintaining balance. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 2** (valued at 89 by Agent 1 and 63 by Agent 0) should be allocated to Agent 1 since it is their highest valued item.
2. **Item 0** (valued at 74 by Agent 1 and 73 by Agent 0) should be allocated to Agent 1 because they value it slightly more than Agent 0.
3. **Item 3** (valued at 53 by Agent 0 and 39 by Agent 1) should be allocated to Agent 0 as Agent 0 values it more.
4. **Item 1** (valued at 40 by Agent 0 and 65 by Agent 1) should be allocated to Agent 0 to balance the total number of items allocated to each agent.

Thus, the allocations would be:

Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3, and Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
