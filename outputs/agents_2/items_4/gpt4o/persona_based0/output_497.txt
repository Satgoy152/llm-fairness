Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3
0  93  14   7  48
1  56   5  72  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly between the two agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, considering the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent.

Let's calculate the valuations for each possible allocation and then choose a fair distribution:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 93
- Item 1: 14
- Item 2: 7
- Item 3: 48

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 56
- Item 1: 5
- Item 2: 72
- Item 3: 35

To achieve a fair allocation, we should try to balance the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent.

### Possible Allocation:
1. Give Agent 0 items 0 and 3.
2. Give Agent 1 items 1 and 2.

- Agent 0's total valuation: 93 (item 0) + 48 (item 3) = 141
- Agent 1's total valuation: 5 (item 1) + 72 (item 2) = 77

This allocation gives each agent two items. Although Agent 0's total valuation is higher than Agent 1's, this allocation is reasonable considering the constraints because each agent receives two items, and Agent 1's most valued item (item 2) is allocated to them.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
