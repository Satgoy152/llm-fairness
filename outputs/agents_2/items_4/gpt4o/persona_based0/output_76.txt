Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3
0  13   2  41  93
1  60  46   4  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to evaluate the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent's perceived value of their own allocation is maximized compared to the other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [13, 2, 41, 93]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [60, 46, 4, 56]

We can start by considering the highest valued items for each agent:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (93) and item 2 (41).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (60) and item 1 (46).

A possible allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items is as follows:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 since it is highly valued by them.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since it is the next highest valued item for them.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 since it is highly valued by them.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since it is the next highest valued item for them.

This allocation gives each agent two items and minimizes the potential for envy because each agent receives their most valued items that are not highly valued by the other agent.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
