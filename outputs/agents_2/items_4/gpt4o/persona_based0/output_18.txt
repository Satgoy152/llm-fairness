Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3
0  80  27  36  86
1  59  78  28  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring that envy-freeness is maximized, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation compared to the other agent's.

Let's look at the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 80
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 36
  - Item 3: 86

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 59
  - Item 1: 78
  - Item 2: 28
  - Item 3: 25

A straightforward approach is to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their highest-valued items:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations** are for items 3 (86) and 0 (80).
2. **Agent 1's highest valuations** are for items 1 (78) and 0 (59).

To achieve a fair allocation, we can assign:

- **Item 3** to Agent 0, as it's their highest valued item not overlapping with Agent 1's top choice.
- **Item 0** to Agent 0, as it is the next highest for Agent 0 and also highly valued by Agent 1, thus balancing the allocation.
- **Item 1** to Agent 1, as it's their highest valued item.
- **Item 2** to Agent 1, as it is the next highest for Agent 1 after item 1, and Agent 0 does not highly value it compared to item 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value relative to the other agent, aiming for envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
