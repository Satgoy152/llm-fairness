Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3
0  42  51  76  95
1  84  46  79  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 46 79 22]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider their valuations for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share.

The valuation table is as follows:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 42 | 51 | 76 | 95 |
| 1          | 84 | 46 | 79 | 22 |

Let's sum up the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's total valuation = 42 + 51 + 76 + 95 = 264
- Agent 1's total valuation = 84 + 46 + 79 + 22 = 231

The difference in total valuations suggests that Agent 0 values the items more overall. Our goal is to distribute the items to minimize envy and ensure both agents feel they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations. 

One approach is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or a simple allocation that considers the highest individual valuations for each agent. Here's a simple allocation strategy based on maximizing individual item valuations for each agent:

1. Agent 0 gets items that they value significantly higher than Agent 1.
2. Agent 1 gets items that they value significantly higher than Agent 0.

Let's look at each item:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 42, Agent 1 at 84. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 51, Agent 1 at 46. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 79. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 95, Agent 1 at 22. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's check if this allocation minimizes envy:

Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3, with valuations of 51 and 95, totaling 146.
Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2, with valuations of 84 and 79, totaling 163.

This allocation is reasonably fair, as each agent receives a comparable total valuation according to their preferences, and the items are distributed based on the higher valuations for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and both agents receive a fair share based on their individual valuations.
