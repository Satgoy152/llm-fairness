Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3
0  27  98  42  98
1  32  50  43  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we first need to assess the agents' valuations and attempt to distribute the items so that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations of two agents for four items, the goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences.

### Valuation Table:
- Agent 0: [27, 98, 42, 98]
- Agent 1: [32, 50, 43, 42]

### Observations:
- Agent 0 values items 1 and 3 the highest (98 each).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (43), followed by item 0 (32).

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it holds one of their highest values.
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as it holds the same highest value as item 1.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it is their second highest-valued item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, reducing the potential for envy.

### Allocation Result:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
