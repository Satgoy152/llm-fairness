Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3
0  62   7  38  12
1  82  82  90   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of the items.

Here are the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 62, Item 1: 7, Item 2: 38, Item 3: 12

- Agent 1's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 82, Item 1: 82, Item 2: 90, Item 3: 1

Let's try to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes overall satisfaction:

1. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest (90), so it's reasonable to allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 1** also values item 0 highly (82), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** values item 1 the least, but since Agent 1 values item 1 highly (82), allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
4. Finally, allocate item 3 to **Agent 0**, as Agent 0 values it more than Agent 1 does.

This results in the following allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 0, 1, and 2.

This allocation ensures that Agent 1, who has higher valuations overall, receives the items they value most, while Agent 0 receives at least one item based on their valuation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
