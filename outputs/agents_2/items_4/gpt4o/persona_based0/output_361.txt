Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3
0  33  90  30  63
1  34  18  91  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [34 18 91 10]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation where each agent receives items such that their valuation is maximized relative to what the other agent receives.

Let's break down the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 33
  - Item 1: 90
  - Item 2: 30
  - Item 3: 63

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 18
  - Item 2: 91
  - Item 3: 10

To achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values this item highly at 90, whereas Agent 1 values it at only 18. Therefore, allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 2**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for this item at 91, compared to Agent 0's 30. Therefore, allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 0 and Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 at 63, which is significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation of 10. Thus, allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
   - For Item 0, Agent 1 values it slightly higher (34) than Agent 0 does (33). Considering the remaining balance, allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation respects the agents' preferences by giving each agent the items they value most highly relative to the other's valuations, achieving a fair division.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
