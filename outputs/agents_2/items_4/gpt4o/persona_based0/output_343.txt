Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3
0  29  27  34  64
1  94   3   9  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own.

Let's examine the agents' valuations for each item:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Item 0: 29
  - Item 1: 27
  - Item 2: 34
  - Item 3: 64

- **Agent 1**:
  - Item 0: 94
  - Item 1: 3
  - Item 2: 9
  - Item 3: 61

Based on these valuations, we want to allocate the items such that each agent receives a set of items that they value highly, minimizing the chance of envy.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0** values Item 3 the most (64), so it makes sense to allocate Item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values Item 0 the most (94), so it makes sense to allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.
- Now, we need to allocate Items 1 and 2.

Continuing with the strategy:

- **Item 2** is valued higher by Agent 0 (34) compared to Agent 1 (9), so allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Item 1** is valued higher by Agent 0 (27) than by Agent 1 (3), but since Agent 1 has only one item so far, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 to balance the number of items.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 and 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 0 and 1

This allocation is envy-free as each agent receives items they value highly, and it balances the number of items given to each agent.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
