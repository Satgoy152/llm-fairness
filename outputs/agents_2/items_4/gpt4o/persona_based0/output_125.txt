Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3
0  93   0  82  47
1  41  51  73  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that maximizes fairness, potentially using concepts like envy-freeness or maximizing the minimum utility. Let's analyze the given valuations:

Agent 0's valuations:
- Item 0: 93
- Item 1: 0
- Item 2: 82
- Item 3: 47

Agent 1's valuations:
- Item 0: 41
- Item 1: 51
- Item 2: 73
- Item 3: 91

To allocate the items fairly, we should consider the following:

1. **Agent 0's highest valuations:** Item 0 (93) and Item 2 (82).
2. **Agent 1's highest valuations:** Item 3 (91) and Item 2 (73).

A possible fair allocation that balances these preferences while ensuring each agent gets enough value and no agent is envious of the other’s allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2]
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 3]

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Total valuation = 93 (Item 0) + 82 (Item 2) = 175
- Agent 1: Total valuation = 51 (Item 1) + 91 (Item 3) = 142

This way, Agent 0 receives their highest-valued item (0) and another high-value item (2), while Agent 1 receives their highest-valued item (3) and a mid-value item (1). Both agents receive two items, and the allocation maximizes each agent’s utility given the other agent’s preferences without causing significant envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
