Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3
0  71   3  86  98
1  32  91  13  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [32 91 13 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's evaluate the situation:

### Valuation Matrix:
- **Agent 0:** Values items as `[71, 3, 86, 98]`
- **Agent 1:** Values items as `[32, 91, 13, 34]`

### Total Valuation:
- **Agent 0 Total Valuation:** \(71 + 3 + 86 + 98 = 258\)
- **Agent 1 Total Valuation:** \(32 + 91 + 13 + 34 = 170\)

### Fair Allocation Strategy:
We will seek to allocate items such that:
- Each agent receives items with a sufficient total valuation from their perspective.
- The allocation reduces envy between agents, ideally aiming for an envy-free allocation.

### Considerations:
1. **Agent 0's highest-valued items:** Items 3 (98) and 2 (86).
2. **Agent 1's highest-valued items:** Items 1 (91) and 3 (34).

#### Attempted Allocation:
- Give Agent 0: Items 0 and 2 (valuations: 71, 86)
  - Total Valuation = \(71 + 86 = 157\)
- Give Agent 1: Items 1 and 3 (valuations: 91, 34)
  - Total Valuation = \(91 + 34 = 125\)

This allocation ensures both agents get their higher-valued items, reducing possible envy. Although this allocation may not be completely envy-free, it attempts to balance the total value each agent receives relative to their own valuations.

### Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
