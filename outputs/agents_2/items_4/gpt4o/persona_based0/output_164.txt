Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3
0  71  26  52  17
1  49  10  74  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a manner that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness is achieved when no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. In this problem, we have two agents (0 and 1) and four items (0, 1, 2, 3).

First, let's evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 71
  - Item 1: 26
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 17
  - Total: 166

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 10
  - Item 2: 74
  - Item 3: 71
  - Total: 204

For an envy-free allocation, each agent should ideally receive items that maximize their perceived value. Let's try a few allocations to find a suitable solution:

**Allocation Attempt 1:**
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value = 71 for Agent 0, value = 49 for Agent 1)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 74 for Agent 1, value = 52 for Agent 0)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value = 26 for Agent 0, value = 10 for Agent 1)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value = 71 for Agent 1, value = 17 for Agent 0)

This allocation results in:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, total value = 97
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3, total value = 145

This allocation minimizes envy as each agent receives items that maximize their own valuation while considering the preferences of the other agent.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
