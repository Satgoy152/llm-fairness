Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  67  16  59  64
1  72  50  26   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate all items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

### Valuations Table:
| Item | Agent 0 | Agent 1 |
|------|---------|---------|
|  0   |   67    |   72    |
|  1   |   16    |   50    |
|  2   |   59    |   26    |
|  3   |   64    |   8     |

### Steps:
1. **Identify Preferences:**  
   - Agent 0 values items 0, 2, and 3 highly.
   - Agent 1 values items 0 and 1 highly.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign the item that each agent values the most first without causing significant envy.
   - Check for possible envy and adjust allocations if necessary to ensure no agent envies another's allocation more than what they receive themselves.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Agent 1 values item 0 the most (72).** Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0 values item 3 the most after item 0 (64).** Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1 values item 1 next (50).** Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 0 values item 2 next (59).** Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their preferences and valuations, minimizing envy.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the distribution is balanced according to their valuations. Agent 0 receives items 2 and 3, while Agent 1 receives items 0 and 1.
