Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3
0  78  83  31  90
1  20  51   2  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's a step-by-step approach to determine an envy-free allocation:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:**

   - Agent 0: 78 + 83 + 31 + 90 = 282
   - Agent 1: 20 + 51 + 2 + 86 = 159

2. **Determine the per-item value each agent has:**

   - Agent 0 values:
     - Item 0: 78
     - Item 1: 83
     - Item 2: 31
     - Item 3: 90

   - Agent 1 values:
     - Item 0: 20
     - Item 1: 51
     - Item 2: 2
     - Item 3: 86

3. **Allocate items to maximize fairness (minimize envy):**

   - Assign items by comparing preferences. Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent, considering the other agent's relative preference for that item. 

   - Agent 0 has high values for items 1 and 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 first, as it's the highest value for both agents (90 for Agent 0, 86 for Agent 1).

   - Next, assign item 0 to Agent 0, since it's the second highest after item 3 for Agent 0, and agent 1 values it the least.

   - Agent 1 would then get item 1, as itâ€™s their highest remaining valued item (51), and item 2, which Agent 0 values the least (31).

4. **Final allocation:**

   - Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2.

This allocation minimizes envy, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
