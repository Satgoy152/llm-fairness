Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3
0  89  12  12  61
1  18  15   5   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a way that is envy-free and efficient, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. Our goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the valuation matrix for reference:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 89 | 12 | 12 | 61 |
| 1          | 18 | 15 | 5  | 9  |

### Step-by-Step Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (89) and item 3 second most (61).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (18) but significantly less than Agent 0. Their next highest value is item 1 (15).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High Valuation:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item that Agent 0 values less.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - For items 2 and 3, consider Agent 0 values item 3 higher (61) than item 2 (12).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is the remaining item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, and the allocation is envy-free since each agent receives the items they value relatively higher within the constraints.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive their fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
