Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3
0  10  67  55  63
1  17  97  81  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 97 81 21]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly between two agents based on their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, where possible. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [10, 67, 55, 63]
- Agent 1's valuations: [17, 97, 81, 21]

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: 10 + 67 + 55 + 63 = 195
- Total value for Agent 1: 17 + 97 + 81 + 21 = 216

Next, one simple approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible):

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 10.
   - Agent 1 values it at 17.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 67.
   - Agent 1 values it at 97.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 55.
   - Agent 1 values it at 81.
   - Allocate to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 63.
   - Agent 1 values it at 21.
   - Allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2]

This distribution ensures each agent has at least one item, and each item has been allocated based on higher valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
