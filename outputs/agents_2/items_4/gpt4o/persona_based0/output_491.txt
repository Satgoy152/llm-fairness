Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3
0  92  88  36  35
1  65  74  63  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness (ensuring that each agent feels they received a fair share relative to their valuations), we can use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or a simple direct comparison based on each agent's valuations. Given that there are only two agents and four items, we can attempt to directly allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while minimizing envy.

The given valuations are:

```
Agent 0: Item 0: 92, Item 1: 88, Item 2: 36, Item 3: 35
Agent 1: Item 0: 65, Item 1: 74, Item 2: 63, Item 3: 70
```

Let's calculate the total value each agent would attribute to each item:

- For Agent 0:
  - Total value = 92 + 88 + 36 + 35 = 251

- For Agent 1:
  - Total value = 65 + 74 + 63 + 70 = 272

To minimize envy, we can try to allocate items based on the highest differences in valuations for each item, ensuring each agent gets items they value more relative to the other agent.

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 92, while Agent 1 at 65. Difference = 27.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 88, while Agent 1 at 74. Difference = 14.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 36, while Agent 1 at 63. Difference = -27.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 35, while Agent 1 at 70. Difference = -35.

From this analysis:

- Item 0 should go to Agent 0 (higher value for Agent 0).
- Item 1 should go to Agent 0 (higher value for Agent 0, but relatively closer).
- Item 2 should go to Agent 1 (higher value for Agent 1).
- Item 3 should go to Agent 1 (higher value for Agent 1).

This allocation maximizes each agent's perception of value relative to the items' perceived worth.

The allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive two items each, respecting their valuations and minimizing potential envy between them.
