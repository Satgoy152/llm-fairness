Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3
0  46  24  90  84
1   3   8  50   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. In an envy-free allocation, each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as that of the other agent, according to their own valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 46     | 24     | 90     | 84     |
| 1     | 3      | 8      | 50     | 3      |

Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest (90) and Item 3 next highest (84). Agent 1 values Item 2 the highest (50) but much lower than Agent 0. 

A good strategy to minimize envy is to ensure each agent gets items they value highly, and Agent 0 should get Item 2 since they value it significantly more than Agent 1. Let's proceed with the following allocation:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 because they value it the most.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 as well, as it is the next highest value for Agent 0.
- Assign Items 0 and 1 to Agent 1. Although these are not highly valued by Agent 1, they are the only remaining items. Agent 1 values Item 0 slightly more than Item 1.

Here's the allocation based on the analysis:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 1

This allocation ensures that Agent 0 gets the items they value most, and Agent 1 gets the remaining items, minimizing overall envy.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
