Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3
0   0  94  94  79
1  55  93  12   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items according to the given valuations, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, or at least minimizes envy between the agents. Here are the steps for the allocation:

1. **Agent 0's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 0
   - Item 1: 94
   - Item 2: 94
   - Item 3: 79

2. **Agent 1's Valuations:**
   - Item 0: 55
   - Item 1: 93
   - Item 2: 12
   - Item 3: 1

**Strategy:**
- Agents should ideally receive items that they value more highly compared to the other agent's valuation of the same items.
- We will look to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while minimizing envy.

**Allocation:**
- **Agent 0** values items 1 and 2 the most at 94 each. Agent 1 values item 1 at 93 and item 2 at only 12. Assign items 1 and 2 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has a significantly higher valuation of item 2 compared to Agent 1.
- **Agent 1** values item 0 the most at 55 and item 1 second most at 93. However, item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0. Thus, assign items 0 and 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation gives Agent 0 a total value of 188 (items 1 and 2) and Agent 1 a total value of 56 (items 0 and 3). Agent 0 receives their top two valued items, and Agent 1 receives the next best available items according to their valuations.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
