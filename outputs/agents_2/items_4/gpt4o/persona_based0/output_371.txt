Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3
0  52  56  72  43
1  32   5  93  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 56 72 43]
 [32  5 93 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as the bundle of items allocated to the other agent.

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0: [52, 56, 72, 43]
- Agent 1: [32, 5, 93, 99]

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we should aim to maximize the value each agent receives from the items they are allocated, ensuring that neither agent prefers the allocation of the other agent.

Let's consider possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Item 0: 52  
   - Item 1: 56  
   - Total valuation: 108

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Item 2: 93  
   - Item 3: 99  
   - Total valuation: 192

Envy-Free Justification:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1, which have a combined value of 108 for them. They value their own bundle more than the bundle given to agent 1 (93 + 99 = 192 for agent 1 but only 134 for agent 0).
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3, which have a combined value of 192 for them. They value their own bundle more than the bundle given to agent 0 (52 + 56 = 108 for agent 0 but only 37 for agent 1).

Therefore, the allocation is envy-free and fair as neither agent would prefer to switch their bundle with the other.

Final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
