Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0  1   2   3
0  67  7  17  93
1  24  7  67  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this fair division problem, we seek an allocation of items such that envy-freeness is maximized or at least fair according to the valuations provided by the agents.

The table of valuations is as follows:

- Agent 0 values: 
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 17
  - Item 3: 93

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 24
  - Item 1: 7
  - Item 2: 67
  - Item 3: 17

Our goal is to allocate the 4 items between the 2 agents while considering their preferences.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 3 (93) and Item 0 (67).
   - Agent 1 highly values Item 2 (67).

2. **Allocate high-value items to each agent:**
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 because it is the highest valued item for this agent.
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 because it is the second highest valued item for this agent and the highest valued item for Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Remaining items are Item 0 and Item 1.
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 higher than Agent 1 (67 vs. 24), so assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 as it is the only item left and has equal value for both agents.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets two items and, given their preferences, is as fair as possible under the circumstances.

### Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
