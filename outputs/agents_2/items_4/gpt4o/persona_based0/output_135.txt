Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3
0  58  89  46  25
1  67  77  94   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents in a manner that considers their valuations and attempts to achieve envy-freeness, we need to analyze the valuations given by each agent for the items.

The valuations for each item by the agents are as follows:

- Agent 0:
  - Item 0: 58
  - Item 1: 89
  - Item 2: 46
  - Item 3: 25

- Agent 1:
  - Item 0: 67
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 94
  - Item 3: 1

A common approach to ensure fairness and minimize envy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's determine the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 67, which is higher than Agent 0’s valuation of 58.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 89, which is higher than Agent 1’s valuation of 77.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 94, which is higher than Agent 0’s valuation of 46.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 25, which is higher than Agent 1’s valuation of 1.

Based on these valuations, the items can be allocated as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 2.

This allocation respects the preferences of the agents as closely as possible and attempts to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
