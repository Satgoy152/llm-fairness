Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3
0  67  32  93  21
1  92  95   3  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free or at least a proportional allocation. Given the valuations, one possible approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item to prevent envy.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values: [67, 32, 93, 21]
- Agent 1 values: [92, 95, 3, 49]

A simple way to proceed is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it higher (92 vs. 67).
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher (95 vs. 32).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it higher (93 vs. 3).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it higher (49 vs. 21).

Based on these preferences, a potential allocation could be:

- Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (higher valuation for Agent 0)
- Assign Items 0, 1, and 3 to Agent 1 (higher valuations for Agent 1)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and it reflects the highest preferences for most items, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 3]
}
```
