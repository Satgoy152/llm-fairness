Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3
0  37  20  97  32
1  40  95   0  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a division that minimizes envy or achieves envy-freeness as much as possible. Here's the breakdown of the agents' valuations for each item:

- **Agent 0's Valuations:**
  - Item 0: 37
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 97
  - Item 3: 32

- **Agent 1's Valuations:**
  - Item 0: 40
  - Item 1: 95
  - Item 2: 0
  - Item 3: 24

By examining the valuations, we can observe the following:

- Agent 0 highly values Item 2 (97), whereas Agent 1 does not value it at all (0).
- Agent 1 highly values Item 1 (95), whereas Agent 0 values it less (20).
- Both agents have moderate valuations for Items 0 and 3, but Agent 1 values Item 0 slightly more than Agent 0.

To achieve a fair division that minimizes envy:

1. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it the most, and Agent 1 doesn't value it at all.
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it the most, and Agent 0 values it significantly less.
3. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1, as they value it slightly more than Agent 0.
4. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0, as a balancing item, since Agent 0 valued Item 2 highly, this helps to maintain some balance and reduces envy.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and minimizes envy:

- Agent 0 receives Items [2, 3], which they value at 97 and 32.
- Agent 1 receives Items [0, 1], which they value at 40 and 95.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
