Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3
0  85  44  89  91
1  69  81  80  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can first calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items, and then attempt to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy.

Let's start by calculating the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 85 + 44 + 89 + 91 = 309
- Agent 1: 69 + 81 + 80 + 22 = 252

Next, we'll try to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation

1. **Assign Items by Highest Valuation:**

   - Agent 0 values item 3 highest (91).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highest (81).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 and item 1 to Agent 1.

2. **Remaining Items:**

   After the first allocation, the remaining items are 0 and 2.

3. **Assign Remaining Items:**

   - Agent 0 values item 2 second highest (89).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 also high (80), but lower than Agent 0's valuation.

   Assign item 2 to Agent 0 based on higher valuation.

   Now, only item 0 is left.

   - Agent 0's next highest valuation is for item 0 (85).
   - Agent 1's valuation for item 0 is (69).

   Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.

This allocation seeks to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on individual item valuations and aims for envy-freeness.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that both agents receive items in a way that reflects their preferences, given their respective valuations.
