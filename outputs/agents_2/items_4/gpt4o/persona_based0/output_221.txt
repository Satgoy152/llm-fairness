Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3
0  80  79  11  35
1  55  37  85  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. Our goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair portion of the total value, or at least a portion that doesn't leave them envious of the other's allocation.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 80 + 79 + 11 + 35 = 205
- Agent 1's total valuation: 55 + 37 + 85 + 28 = 205

Since both agents have the same total valuation, we aim to divide the items such that each agent gets approximately half of the total valuation based on their individual preferences.

Considering the high valuations first:

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (85), so it makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (80), so it makes sense to allocate this item to Agent 0.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- For item 1, Agent 0 values it at 79, while Agent 1 values it at 37. Allocating it to Agent 0 will efficiently use their valuation.
- For item 3, Agent 0 values it at 35, while Agent 1 values it at 28. Allocating it to Agent 1 will balance the distribution.

Now, let's check the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 1 have a total valuation of 80 + 79 = 159
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 3 have a total valuation of 85 + 28 = 113

Agent 0 has a higher cumulative valuation, but the allocation ensures that Agent 1 receives the item they value the highest. This is a common approach to achieving envy-freeness when perfect balance isn't attainable due to integer constraints.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
