Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3
0  11  11  26  30
1  52  13  45  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible given the constraints. This means trying to ensure that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as the other agent's allocation, based on their individual valuations.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 11
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 30

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 52
  - Item 1: 13
  - Item 2: 45
  - Item 3: 47

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (52), and it is significantly higher than Agent 0's valuation (11).
   - Agent 1 also values item 3 highly (47), compared to Agent 0's valuation (30).
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highly (26), compared to Agent 1's valuation (45), but item 2 is more valuable to Agent 0 relative to other items.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the same as item 0, both at 11, which are the lowest among all items for Agent 0.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations**:
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 1 as it is most valuable to them and not as valuable to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as it is also more valuable to them compared to Agent 0.

3. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 since it is their highest valued item.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as it balances their allocation, and Agent 1 values it the least.

**Final Allocation**:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
