Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3
0  33  52  82  63
1   8  17  55  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents (0 and 1), we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free to the extent possible given the integer constraints, and that each agent values their allocation as much as possible based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0's valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 3 are 33, 52, 82, and 63 respectively.
- Agent 1's valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 3 are 8, 17, 55, and 51 respectively.

One approach to allocate the items is to maximize each agent's total value while attempting to minimize envy. In this simple case, we can start by giving each agent the item they value most highly.

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the most (82), followed by item 3 (63), item 1 (52), and item 0 (33).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the most (55), followed by item 3 (51), item 1 (17), and item 0 (8).

For a fair allocation, consider these steps:

- Allocate item 2 to agent 0, as they value it the highest.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 1, as it is their second-highest valued item and the highest available after item 2.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 0, as it is the next highest valued item for agent 0 after item 2.
- Allocate item 0 to agent 1, as it is the remaining item.

This results in:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 0.

Both agents get a fair share considering the valuations and the items are distributed to maximize each agent's total value while minimizing envy.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3, 0]
}
```
