Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3
0   8  69   6  76
1  57  53  88   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, let's consider the optimal allocation of items based on the agents' valuations. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that no agent would prefer to have the items allocated to another agent based on their valuations.

Here are the valuations for reference:

- Agent 0: [8, 69, 6, 76]
- Agent 1: [57, 53, 88, 6]

A good strategy is to maximize each agent's total value, while also ensuring no agent envies another's allocation.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent would derive if they received all items:

- Total value for Agent 0: \(8 + 69 + 6 + 76 = 159\)
- Total value for Agent 1: \(57 + 53 + 88 + 6 = 204\)

Next, let's examine the valuation of each item by the agents to decide the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 8, Agent 1 at 57
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 69, Agent 1 at 53
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 6, Agent 1 at 88
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 6

To ensure an envy-free allocation, let's assign items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction and balancing total values:

1. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for any item by either agent, valued at 88 by Agent 1).
2. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (valued at 76 by Agent 0, which is the highest for Agent 0).
3. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0 (valued at 69 by Agent 0, higher than Agent 1's valuation of 53).
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (valued at 57 by Agent 1, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 8).

Now, both agents have 2 items each, and the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 0 and 2

The total values for each agent:

- Agent 0: \(69 + 76 = 145\)
- Agent 1: \(57 + 88 = 145\)

The total values are balanced, and each agent receives items they value highly. This should result in an envy-free allocation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
