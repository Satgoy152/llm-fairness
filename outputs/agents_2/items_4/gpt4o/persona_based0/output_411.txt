Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3
0  92  35  87  61
1  39  94  29  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a way that minimizes envy and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have a fair share based on their own valuations.

Let's first consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 92 (item 0) + 35 (item 1) + 87 (item 2) + 61 (item 3) = 275
- Agent 1's total valuation: 39 (item 0) + 94 (item 1) + 29 (item 2) + 43 (item 3) = 205

Now, let's attempt a fair allocation. One common fair division method is to allocate items to maximize each agent's total perceived value. However, since we only have two agents and four items, and to avoid envy, we can try to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value the most.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 0 and item 2.
- Agent 1: Allocate item 1 and item 3.

Checking the perceived values:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 92 (item 0) + 87 (item 2) = 179
- Agent 1's total valuation: 94 (item 1) + 43 (item 3) = 137

This allocation gives both agents their highest valued items and minimizes potential envy.

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
