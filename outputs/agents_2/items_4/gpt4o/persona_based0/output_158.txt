Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3
0  57  97  52  72
1  89  20  90  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to make sure that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as they perceive in the allocation, considering the total worth of the items.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 57
  - Item 1: 97
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 72

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 89
  - Item 1: 20
  - Item 2: 90
  - Item 3: 55

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items combined:

- Agent 0 total valuation: 57 + 97 + 52 + 72 = 278
- Agent 1 total valuation: 89 + 20 + 90 + 55 = 254

A fair allocation would try to equalize the perceived value each agent receives. We can allocate the items such that each agent receives approximately half of the total value based on their own valuations.

Let's consider the allocations:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 greatly values Item 0 (89 compared to Agent 0's 57).

2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 highly (97 compared to Agent 1's 20).

3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values Item 2 highly (90 compared to Agent 0's 52).

4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values Item 3 more than Agent 1 (72 compared to 55).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 3 with a total value of 169 (97 + 72).
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 2 with a total value of 179 (89 + 90).

This allocation should be envy-free based on the agents' valuations. Each agent receives items they value highly, and the total values are close.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```
