Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3
0   2  91   2  70
1  19  17  16  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we can consider their valuations of each item and attempt to achieve an envy-free allocation, where neither agent prefers the allocation of the other. Given the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 2
  - Item 1: 91
  - Item 2: 2
  - Item 3: 70

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 19
  - Item 1: 17
  - Item 2: 16
  - Item 3: 83

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **High valuations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values Item 1 (91) and Item 3 (70).
   - Agent 1 highly values Item 3 (83).

2. **Mutual interest:**
   - Both agents have a significant interest in Item 3, but Agent 1 values it more (83 vs. 70).
   - Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 0 and less so by Agent 1 (91 vs. 17).

3. **Strategy:**
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0 since it is highly valued by them and less by Agent 1.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valued item.
   - For the remaining items, Items 0 and 2, both agents have relatively low valuations, but Agent 1 values Item 0 (19) higher than Agent 0 (2).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1 and Item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation seeks to minimize envy and distribute items based on the highest relative valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 2, while Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 3. This distribution attempts to match each agent's highest preferences while keeping the allocation fair.
