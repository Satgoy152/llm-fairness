Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3
0  13  12  93  49
1  31  78  98  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Let's evaluate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0's valuations: 13, 12, 93, 49
  - Total valuation for Agent 0 = 13 + 12 + 93 + 49 = 167

- Agent 1's valuations: 31, 78, 98, 57
  - Total valuation for Agent 1 = 31 + 78 + 98 + 57 = 264

The objective is to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. We look for a way to distribute the items that minimizes envy, based on the highest valuations each agent has for the available items.

Consider the following steps to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (93), and Agent 1 also values item 2 the highest (98). However, Agent 1 has a higher overall valuation for item 1 (78) and item 2 (98) than Agent 0. To balance, let's give item 2 to Agent 1.

2. Agent 0 values item 3 second highest (49). Agent 1 values item 3 at 57, which is less than their valuation of item 1 (78). Therefore, assign item 3 to Agent 0.

3. Agent 1 values item 1 the second highest (78). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

4. Finally, item 0 has the lowest valuation for both agents. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they have a slightly lower total valuation and this helps balance the distribution.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3 with a total valuation of 13 + 49 = 62.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2 with a total valuation of 78 + 98 = 176.

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution by considering both agents' highest preferences and overall valuations.
