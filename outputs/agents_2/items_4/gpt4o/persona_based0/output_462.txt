Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3
0  78  33  90  96
1  47  40  60  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's valuation of the items they receive. We'll use a method similar to the adjusted winner procedure or the maximum envy-free allocation.

First, let's summarize the agents' valuations of the items:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 78
  - Item 1: 33
  - Item 2: 90
  - Item 3: 96

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 40
  - Item 2: 60
  - Item 3: 69

We need to allocate the items such that no agent envies the other, ideally maximizing each agent's satisfaction.

1. Calculate the total valuations for each agent if they were to receive all items:
   - Agent 0: 78 + 33 + 90 + 96 = 297
   - Agent 1: 47 + 40 + 60 + 69 = 216

2. Start by allocating items to the agent who values them most, ensuring we maintain balance:
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it higher (96 vs. 69)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it higher (90 vs. 60)
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it higher (78 vs. 47)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it higher (40 vs. 33)

3. By allocating in this manner, we aim to distribute the items so that the total valuation of items for each agent is as close as possible, considering their preferences.

The allocation that achieves this is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0 a total valuation of 78 + 90 = 168
- Agent 1 a total valuation of 40 + 69 = 109

Since each agent receives the items they value more, this allocation is envy-free.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
