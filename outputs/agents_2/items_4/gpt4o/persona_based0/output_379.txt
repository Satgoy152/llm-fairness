Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3
0  79  70  81   1
1  27  49  52  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their own preferences.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: 
  - Item 0: 79
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 81
  - Item 3: 1

- Agent 1's valuations:
  - Item 0: 27
  - Item 1: 49
  - Item 2: 52
  - Item 3: 96

One potential approach is to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total utility for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

1. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values Item 3 the most (96), while Agent 0 values it the least (1).
2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values Item 2 the most (81), and it has a higher value compared to Agent 1's valuation (52).
3. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0:** Agent 0 values Item 0 highly (79), compared to Agent 1's valuation (27).
4. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1:** Agent 1 values Item 1 more (49) than Agent 0 does (70), but this allocation helps balance the total value each agent receives.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.
