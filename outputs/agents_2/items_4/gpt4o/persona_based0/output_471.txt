Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2  3
0  14   8  59  6
1  49  75  53  2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations while ensuring envy-freeness, we must consider how each agent values the items and distribute them in a manner that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation. 

Given the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items: 
  - Item 0: 14
  - Item 1: 8
  - Item 2: 59
  - Item 3: 6

- Agent 1 values items:
  - Item 0: 49
  - Item 1: 75
  - Item 2: 53
  - Item 3: 2

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use the following approach:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values this item the most (59), and it is the highest valued item for them.

2. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values this item the most (75), and it is the highest valued item for them.

3. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1**: This item is the second-highest valued item for Agent 1 (49), and it helps balance the allocation.

4. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0**: This item has the least value for both agents, but since Agent 1 has already received Items 1 and 0, giving Item 3 to Agent 0 helps balance the total allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and no agent envies the other's allocation given their preferences. 

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
