Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3
0  61  31  35  20
1  83  73   7  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible, given their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Valuations Overview:**

   - Agent 0: 
     - Item 0: 61
     - Item 1: 31
     - Item 2: 35
     - Item 3: 20

   - Agent 1:
     - Item 0: 83
     - Item 1: 73
     - Item 2: 7
     - Item 3: 36

2. **Objective:**
   - We aim to allocate all four items in such a way that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocation minimizes envy.
   
3. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the items, ensuring fairness.

4. **Allocation:**
   - **Item 0**: 
     - Valuation: Agent 0 (61) vs. Agent 1 (83)
     - Assign to Agent 1 because they value it more.

   - **Item 1**: 
     - Valuation: Agent 0 (31) vs. Agent 1 (73)
     - Assign to Agent 1 because they value it more.

   - **Item 2**: 
     - Valuation: Agent 0 (35) vs. Agent 1 (7)
     - Assign to Agent 0 because they value it more.

   - **Item 3**: 
     - Valuation: Agent 0 (20) vs. Agent 1 (36)
     - Assign to Agent 1 because they value it more.

5. **Final Allocation:**

   ```json
   {
       "0": [2],
       "1": [0, 1, 3]
   }
   ```

This allocation gives Agent 0 the item they value more than Agent 1, and Agent 1 receives the items they value more than Agent 0, thus minimizing envy. Agent 1 receives three items due to their higher overall valuations, ensuring that the allocation is fair given the constraints.
