Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3
0  47  87  94  38
1  83  77  40  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to maximize each agent's total satisfaction based on their valuations and ensure that no agent feels envy towards the other's allocation.

Let's summarize the valuations:

- Agent 0: 
  - Item 0: 47
  - Item 1: 87
  - Item 2: 94
  - Item 3: 38

- Agent 1: 
  - Item 0: 83
  - Item 1: 77
  - Item 2: 40
  - Item 3: 78

We will aim for a solution where each agent gets two items and the distribution is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Find the highest valued item for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (94).
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (83).

2. **Allocate the highest valued items to each agent:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate remaining items to balance the total valuation:**
   - Remaining items are 1 and 3.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 at 87 and item 3 at 38.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 at 77 and item 3 at 78.

4. **Assign remaining items to balance valuations:**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (total value = 94 + 87 = 181).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (total value = 83 + 78 = 161).

The allocations are close in terms of total value, and each agent has received items they highly value, reducing envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure both agents have high total valuations and minimized envy.
