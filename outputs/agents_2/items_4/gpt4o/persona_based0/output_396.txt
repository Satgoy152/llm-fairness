Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3
0  55  70  99   6
1  87  31  26  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's break down the problem:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 55
  - Item 1: 70
  - Item 2: 99
  - Item 3: 6

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 87
  - Item 1: 31
  - Item 2: 26
  - Item 3: 85

A potential approach is to maximize the fairness by ensuring that the allocation minimizes envy. Let's compare the total values each agent would receive for different allocations and try to balance them.

After analyzing the valuations, one possible allocation that minimizes envy and provides a fair division is:

- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 3.

Here's the breakdown:

- Agent 0's total value from items 1 and 2: 70 + 99 = 169
- Agent 1's total value from items 0 and 3: 87 + 85 = 172

This allocation gives both agents a nearly equal total value according to their preferences, minimizing envy between them.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
