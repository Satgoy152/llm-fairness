Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3
0  36  47  92  71
1  42  22  61  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to assign the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations, and no agent envies the other for what they received.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: [36, 47, 92, 71]
- Agent 1 values the items as follows: [42, 22, 61, 96]

We can aim to maximize each agent's total perceived value from their allocation. One method to achieve this is to allocate items by maximizing the minimum value an agent receives, thus ensuring that no agent is envious of another's allocation.

Here's one approach to achieve an envy-free allocation:

1. Item 2 has the highest valuation for Agent 0 (92), and it is also quite high for Agent 1 (61), but relatively much higher for Agent 0. We assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Item 3 has the highest valuation for Agent 1 (96), so we assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
3. For the remaining items (0 and 1), we assign them based on maximizing each agent's total value:
   - Agent 0 has a higher valuation for Item 0 (36 vs. 42) compared to Agent 1's valuation of Item 1 (22 vs. 47).
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 and Item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that are valuable to them, maintaining fairness and minimizing potential envy.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3]
}
```
