Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3
0  19  95  25  44
1  86  19  36  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 19 36 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items between two agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations.

Here is the valuation matrix for the two agents:

- Agent 0: [19, 95, 25, 44]
- Agent 1: [86, 19, 36, 59]

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 19 + 95 + 25 + 44 = 183
- Agent 1: 86 + 19 + 36 + 59 = 200

To achieve envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that neither agent feels the other has a better allocation.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Each agent should ideally receive the item(s) they value the most.
   
2. **Balance Total Value**: Attempt to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

Based on the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most.

### Proposed Allocation

Let's proceed with the following allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that maximize their total valuation without significantly disadvantaging Agent 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that maximize their total valuation without significantly disadvantaging Agent 0.

#### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 3]
  - Value: 95 (item 1) + 44 (item 3) = 139

- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 2]
  - Value: 86 (item 0) + 36 (item 2) = 122

This allocation ensures that each agent receives two items, and the allocation respects their preferences as much as possible given the constraint of integer allocations.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts an envy-free division, given the integer allocation constraint, by assigning high-value items to each agent according to their preferences.
