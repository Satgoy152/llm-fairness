Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  87  13  82  21
1  67  32  59  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly between the two agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, which means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over the other agent's allocation based on their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

**Valuations Table:**

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 87     | 13     | 82     | 21     |
| 1     | 67     | 32     | 59     | 52     |

**Steps:**

1. **Initial Analysis:**  
   - Agent 0 values Item 0 and Item 2 the highest.
   - Agent 1 values Item 0 and Item 2 the highest as well, but slightly less than Agent 0.

2. **Allocating High-Value Items:**  
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (value = 87 for Agent 0, which is the highest valuation for any item).
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 59 for Agent 1, which is the second-highest value for Agent 1).

3. **Allocating Remaining Items:**  
   - Items 1 and 3 are left. We check the remaining preferences.
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (value = 32 for Agent 1).
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0 (value = 21 for Agent 0).

This allocation minimizes envy as each agent receives items that maximize their own total valuation given what's available.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```

Here, Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 3, and Agent 1 receives Items 1 and 2. This allocation ensures that both agents receive a fair share based on their valuations, minimizing the potential for envy.
