Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3
0  99  66  65  15
1  18   9  65  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents according to their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close as possible, given the constraint of integer allocations.

Here's the table of valuations for reference:

```
        Item 0  Item 1  Item 2  Item 3
Agent 0   99      66      65      15
Agent 1   18       9      65      65
```

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 places the highest value on Item 0 (99).
   - Agent 1 values Item 3 (65) the same as Item 2.
   - Both agents value Item 2 equally (65).

2. **Allocate Item 0:**
   - Item 0 goes to Agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it (99).

3. **Allocate Item 3:**
   - Item 3 is preferred by Agent 1 (valuing it at 65 compared to Agent 0's 15). Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

4. **Allocate Item 2:**
   - Item 2 has equal value for both agents (65), but Agent 0 has a higher total value if given Item 2 and Item 0. Therefore, to balance, allocate Item 2 to Agent 1 to provide them with a high-value item.

5. **Allocate Item 1:**
   - Item 1 is valued more by Agent 0 compared to Agent 1 (66 vs. 9). Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives Items 2 and 3.

This allocation aims to minimize envy and balance the values each agent receives based on their preferences.
