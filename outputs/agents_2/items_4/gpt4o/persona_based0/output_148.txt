Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3
0  21  72  80  74
1  64  39  47  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuations while keeping the allocation envy-free, if possible. Given that we have two agents and four items, each agent should ideally receive two items.

Let's first review the valuations:

- Agent 0 values the items as follows: 
  - Item 0: 21
  - Item 1: 72
  - Item 2: 80
  - Item 3: 74

- Agent 1 values the items as follows:
  - Item 0: 64
  - Item 1: 39
  - Item 2: 47
  - Item 3: 20

To achieve a fair allocation, we need to consider the total value each agent places on the items and attempt to distribute them such that neither agent envies the other's allocation.

**Step 1:** Calculate total valuations for each agent.

Agent 0's total valuation: 21 + 72 + 80 + 74 = 247  
Agent 1's total valuation: 64 + 39 + 47 + 20 = 170

**Step 2:** Consider allocations that maximize each agent's satisfaction without causing envy. A direct approach is to try different allocations and see which one minimizes envy.

**Step 3:** Allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total satisfaction while maintaining a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 prefers items with the highest values: 80, 74 (Items 2, 3)
- Agent 1 is left with items: 21, 64 (Items 0, 1)

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 3, with a total valuation of 154.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1, with a total valuation of 103.

Even though Agent 1's total valuation is lower, this allocation minimizes potential envy given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 1]
}
```
