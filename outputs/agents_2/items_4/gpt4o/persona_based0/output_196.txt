Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3
0  59  26   3  52
1  44   4  51  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents while considering envy-freeness, we want to assign items such that each agent feels that they are receiving a fair share based on their valuations. We will use a simple strategy to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Assign items to maximize the minimum satisfaction (least envy) between agents.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns:

- Agent 0: \( 59 + 26 + 3 + 52 = 140 \)
- Agent 1: \( 44 + 4 + 51 + 60 = 159 \)

Now, let's consider possible allocations. We aim to balance the perceived value each agent receives, aiming for an envy-free distribution. We can proceed by evaluating individual item values to each agent and assigning them in a way that minimizes envy.

Given the values:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 59, and Agent 1 values it at 44.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 26, and Agent 1 values it at 4.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 3, and Agent 1 values it at 51.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 52, and Agent 1 values it at 60.

One reasonable allocation that minimizes envy could be:

- Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign items 2 and 3 to Agent 1.

Let's check the value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1: \( 59 + 26 = 85 \)
- Agent 1 receives items 2 and 3: \( 51 + 60 = 111 \)

This allocation minimizes envy because Agent 0 values their allocation at 85, while Agent 1 values their allocation higher, at 111, which reflects each agent's preferences without causing significant envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3]
}
```
