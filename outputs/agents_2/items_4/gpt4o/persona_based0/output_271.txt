Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3
0  95  74  95  33
1  84  79  20  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [84 79 20 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items between these two agents, we will aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. Envy-freeness ensures that each agent believes their allocation is at least as valuable as that of the other agents.

### Valuations Table:
- Agent 0: Items [0: 95, 1: 74, 2: 95, 3: 33]
- Agent 1: Items [0: 84, 1: 79, 2: 20, 3: 78]

### Total Valuation:
- Agent 0's total valuation: 95 + 74 + 95 + 33 = 297
- Agent 1's total valuation: 84 + 79 + 20 + 78 = 261

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values items 0 and 2 highly (95 each).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highly (79).

2. **Initial High-Value Allocation:**
   - Allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Only item 3 is left. It will be allocated to Agent 1 as it brings Agent 1’s total valuation closer to Agent 0’s while respecting the integer allocation constraint.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items [0, 2].
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 3].

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent gets from the items, minimizing potential envy.

### Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
