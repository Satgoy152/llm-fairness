Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1  2   3
0  50  29  4  53
1  95  51  1  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division where each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent. In this scenario, we only have two agents and four items, so we can try different allocations to achieve a fair division.

Let's consider the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0 values items as follows: 50, 29, 4, 53.
- Agent 1 values items as follows: 95, 51, 1, 97.

A potential allocation strategy is to assign items based on each agent's highest valuation first, while ensuring that the overall allocation remains envy-free or as fair as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 1's highest valued item is item 3 (value 97).**
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 0's highest valued item is item 3 (value 53), but since it's taken, item 0 (value 50) is next highest.**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 1's next highest valued item is item 0 (value 95), but since it's taken, item 1 (value 51) is next.**
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

4. **The remaining item is item 2, valued by Agent 0 at 4 and Agent 1 at 1.**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as it is valued higher by Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives two items and utilizes all four items. The allocation is reasonably fair given the agents' valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3]
}
```
