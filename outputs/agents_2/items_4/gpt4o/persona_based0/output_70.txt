Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 2 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 4 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3
0  88  37  55  15
1   4  44  59  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:

    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 4 items are allocated in total.
    
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items between the two agents, we will aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy or maximizes each agent's utility based on their valuations. A common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of utilities while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations:

- Agent 0's valuations: [88, 37, 55, 15]
- Agent 1's valuations: [4, 44, 59, 52]

To maximize fairness, we can follow these steps:

1. **Assign Item 0 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 at 88, which is significantly higher than Agent 1's valuation of 4.
2. **Assign Item 2 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 at 59, higher than Agent 0's valuation of 55.
3. **Assign Item 1 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 at 44, which is higher than Agent 0's valuation of 37.
4. **Assign Item 3 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 3 at 15, which is higher than Agent 1's valuation of 52. However, this allocation balances the total value received by both agents considering previous allocations.

Now, let's verify the total utility for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, with total value: 88 + 15 = 103.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 2, with total value: 44 + 59 = 103.

Both agents receive equal total value, which is a fair allocation given the constraints.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2]
}
```
