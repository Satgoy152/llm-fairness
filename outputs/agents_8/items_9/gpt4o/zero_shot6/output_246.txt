Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  50  23  34  25  22   8  28  86
1  86  67  69  24  92  87  97  80  39
2  57  29  97  22   0  39  47  19   4
3  86  39  62  37  92  69  40  17  70
4  73  84  43  47  82  47  66  17  94
5  42  77  29   8  56  30  20  89  47
6  79  31  89  61  96  78  99  25  43
7  33  37  47  63  40  95  92  74  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items based on their valuations. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, some agents will receive one item while others might receive none. The goal is to allocate the items such that the overall value perceived by each agent is balanced as much as possible.

Here is one possible fair allocation of the items:

- Agent 0 receives item 8, which they value at 86.
- Agent 1 receives item 6, which they value at 97.
- Agent 2 receives item 2, which they value at 97.
- Agent 3 receives item 4, which they value at 92.
- Agent 4 receives item 1, which they value at 84.
- Agent 5 receives item 7, which they value at 89.
- Agent 6 receives item 5, which they value at 78.
- Agent 7 receives item 3, which they value at 63.

Each agent gets one item, which maximizes their valuations relative to the other available items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [3]
}
```
