Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  19  85  41  97  68  88  47  51
1  91  36  37  98  84  37  24  40  11
2  58  94  61  39  75  76  50  92  12
3  88  40  84  36  31  70  32  66  86
4  21  12  49  68   7  19  68  15   5
5  10  44   4  56  63  91  55  51  43
6  97  88   7   9  42  69  25  69  23
7   0  77  82  33  63  96  87  29  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations provided:

- Agent 0: [84, 19, 85, 41, 97, 68, 88, 47, 51]
- Agent 1: [91, 36, 37, 98, 84, 37, 24, 40, 11]
- Agent 2: [58, 94, 61, 39, 75, 76, 50, 92, 12]
- Agent 3: [88, 40, 84, 36, 31, 70, 32, 66, 86]
- Agent 4: [21, 12, 49, 68, 7, 19, 68, 15, 5]
- Agent 5: [10, 44, 4, 56, 63, 91, 55, 51, 43]
- Agent 6: [97, 88, 7, 9, 42, 69, 25, 69, 23]
- Agent 7: [0, 77, 82, 33, 63, 96, 87, 29, 11]

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: We will first try to allocate items with the highest valuations to the corresponding agents.
2. **Balance Allocations**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while maximizing the total valuation.

### Allocation Steps

- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 6 (97).
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 2 (94).
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 0 (85).
- **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 1 (98).
- **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 0 (97).
- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 7 (96).
- **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 0 (88).
- **Item 7**: Allocate to Agent 2 (92).
- **Item 8**: Allocate to Agent 3 (86).

### Final Allocation

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, maximizing the total value for each agent based on their preferences.
