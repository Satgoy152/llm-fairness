Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  52  12  72  24  36   7  54  62
1  57  31  33  72  98  61  89  39  55
2   0   1  15   4  73  96  41  72  89
3  56  13  65   8  81  42  73  72  86
4  10  15   0   6  10  33  98  74  33
5  10  97   9  58  92  93   2  92  19
6  84  83   3  85  44   4  41  88  57
7  61  53  97  34  63  86  82  86  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value of the items each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent can receive an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

After evaluating the valuations, an optimal allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (value = 72)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (value = 98)
- Agent 2: Item 8 (value = 89)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (value = 73)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (value = 74)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (value = 93)
- Agent 6: Item 0 (value = 84)
- Agent 7: Items 1 and 2 (values = 53 and 97)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a valuable item, with one agent receiving two items.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [1, 2]
}
```
