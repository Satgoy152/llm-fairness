Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  69  17   7  34  44  88  30  50
1   7  60  95  50  78  84  85   8  62
2  67  14  45  69  31  20  14   8  68
3  88  16  41  59   9  42  95  28  58
4  25  73  88  60  36  88   9  55  96
5   6  73  39   7  45  29  14  70  11
6   9  39  40  44  77  77  52  80  97
7  97  28  56  42  68  24  27  56  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items. Our goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's start by examining the highest valuations and allocate items to the agents accordingly. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (88). Allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (95). Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 8 (68). Allocate item 8 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 6, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 0 (88). Allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 8, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 2, but it's also taken. Next available is item 5 (88). Allocate item 5 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (70). Allocate item 7 to agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 8, but it's taken. Next highest are items 4 and 5 (77), but item 5 is taken. Allocate item 4 to agent 6.
8. **Agent 7**: Highest valuation is for item 0, but it's taken. Next highest is item 8, but it's taken. Next available is item 1 (28). Allocate item 1 to agent 7.

Finally, we need to allocate the remaining item 3. The agent with the highest remaining valuation for item 3 is Agent 3 (59). However, Agent 3 already has an item. Let's allocate item 3 to an agent with no allocation yet, starting from the top:

- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3, since Agent 1 has only one item and values it at 50.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed while trying to respect the agents' valuations as much as possible.
