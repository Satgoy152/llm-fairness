Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  32  56   3  82  28  16  86  70
1   2  30  13   9  66  78   8  75  29
2  65  95   5  25  66  67  50  14  81
3  69   0  90  68  45  18  34  77  63
4  34  51  29  75  24  11  81  52  44
5  62  19  66  75  48  72  74  90  24
6  96  26  69  39  85  34  43  49  29
7  84  56  12  90  36  90  68  12  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to balance both the number of items and the preferences based on their valuations. We start by examining the highest valuations each agent has and attempt to assign items such that the total allocation remains fair and balanced.

Here's a possible allocation considering the valuations and aiming to distribute the items evenly:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation items are 0 (91), 7 (86), and 4 (82).
- Agent 1: Highest valuation items are 5 (78) and 7 (75).
- Agent 2: Highest valuation items are 1 (95) and 8 (81).
- Agent 3: Highest valuation items are 2 (90) and 3 (68).
- Agent 4: Highest valuation item is 6 (81).
- Agent 5: Highest valuation items are 7 (90) and 5 (72).
- Agent 6: Highest valuation item is 0 (96).
- Agent 7: Highest valuation items are 3 (90) and 5 (90).

Next, we distribute the items ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, based on their highest preference and maintaining fairness:

1. Agent 0 receives item 0.
2. Agent 1 receives item 5.
3. Agent 2 receives item 1.
4. Agent 3 receives item 2.
5. Agent 4 receives item 6.
6. Agent 5 receives item 7.
7. Agent 6 receives item 3.
8. Agent 7 receives item 4.
9. Agent 7 receives item 8 (as Agent 7 has high valuations for these).

Now, let's summarize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [4, 8]
}
```

This ensures that all 9 items are allocated, each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation respects the higher valuations where possible.
