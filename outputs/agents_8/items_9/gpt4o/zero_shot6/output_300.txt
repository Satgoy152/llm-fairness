Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1   4  94  35  77  64  78  69  87
1  56   0  19  81  51  32  73  31  29
2  26  13  13  15  75  85  16   3  90
3  53  89  41  17  41  96  74  68  90
4  42  16  18  41  12  48  44  50  58
5  76  65  98   5  79  43  59  60  45
6  95  67  82   9  34  58  16  53  59
7   7  85  20  25  95   3  26  78  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among 8 agents, we should aim to assign items such that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and the overall allocation maximizes the satisfaction (valuation) of each agent. Given there are more agents than items, some agents will inevitably receive no items. Let's look at the valuation table and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuation for item 2 (94).
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuation for item 3 (81).
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuation for item 8 (90).
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuation for item 5 (96).
5. **Agent 4**: Has moderate valuations, but no standout high values compared to others.
6. **Agent 5**: Has high valuation for item 2 (98).
7. **Agent 6**: Has high valuation for item 0 (95).
8. **Agent 7**: Has high valuation for item 4 (95).

Based on maximizing valuations, here are the allocations:

- Allocate item 2 to agent 5 since they have the highest valuation for it.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 1 as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Allocate item 8 to agent 2 since they value it highly.
- Allocate item 5 to agent 3 for their high valuation.
- Allocate item 0 to agent 6 for their high valuation.
- Allocate item 4 to agent 7 for their high valuation.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 0, as it's one of their higher valuation items.
- Allocate item 6 to agent 0, as they also have a reasonably high valuation for it.
- Allocate item 7 to agent 3, as it's one of their higher valuation items left after considering other allocations.

After these allocations, agent 4 receives no items because their valuations are generally lower compared to others for items left unallocated.

Here are the final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [4]
}
```
