Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  23  77   1  50  53  18  87  90
1   7  63  67  57  75  76  26  94  46
2  47  21  17  75  57  13  31  28  38
3  15   6  23   8   8  12  27  50  79
4  54  28  98  42  59   7  31  58  59
5  65   3  66  60  75  73  77  41   9
6  57  17   4  84  66  61   3  55  14
7  21  94  75  13  31  48  89  17  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, then adjust to ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is one way to allocate the items to the agents based on the given valuations:

- Item 0 (value 93) is most valued by agent 0.
- Item 1 (value 94) is most valued by agent 7.
- Item 2 (value 98) is most valued by agent 4.
- Item 3 (value 84) is most valued by agent 6.
- Item 4 (value 75) is equally valued by agents 1 and 5. Let's assign it to agent 1 as there is another item agent 5 can get.
- Item 5 (value 76) is most valued by agent 1.
- Item 6 (value 89) is most valued by agent 7.
- Item 7 (value 94) is most valued by agent 1.
- Item 8 (value 90) is most valued by agent 0.

The allocations can be presented in the required JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all 9 items allocated in total.
