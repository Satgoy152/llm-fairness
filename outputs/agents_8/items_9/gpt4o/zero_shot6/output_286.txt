Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  10  53  42  25  54  30  35  82
1   3  91  91  44  12   6  95  46  65
2   0  91  64  81  23  56  59  60  75
3  67  70  62  83  79  92  85  89  82
4   0  83  63   8  46  87  99  79  47
5  34  46  58  91   5  44   2  86  47
6   6  20  91  29  82  90  19   3  68
7  76  81  68  19  68  27   6   9  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the sum of valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. However, given the constraints, we might need to focus on ensuring each agent gets a fair allocation based on their highest preferences.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the allocations step by step.

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most with a value of 54.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most with a value of 95.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most with a value of 91.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most with a value of 92, but since it's taken, we can give them item 7 with a value of 89.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most with a value of 99, but since it's taken, we can give them item 5 with a value of 87.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the most with a value of 91.
- Agent 6 values item 2 the most with a value of 91.
- Agent 7 values item 0 the most with a value of 76.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 4 can go to Agent 3.
- Item 8 can go to Agent 7.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [0, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with an emphasis on giving each agent at least one of their most valued items where possible.
