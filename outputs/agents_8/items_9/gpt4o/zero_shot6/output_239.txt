Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  83  19  61  93  19  97  18  28
1  89  22   0  50  11   2  47  31  26
2  16  47  83  21   2  40  15  32  74
3  30  79  92  94  19  67  74  55  65
4  58  91  92  54  35  40  34  38   3
5  79  86  43  45  12  20  68  90  56
6  97  49  42  58  37  50  61   6  82
7  38  57  96  93  57  12  60  57   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. Given the constraints, it may not be possible to achieve an absolutely optimal allocation for each agent, but we can strive for a reasonable distribution. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Repeat until all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation based on this approach:

- Item 0: Highest value is for Agent 6 (97).
- Item 1: Highest value is for Agent 4 (91).
- Item 2: Highest value is for Agent 7 (96).
- Item 3: Highest value is for Agent 3 (94).
- Item 4: Highest value is for Agent 0 (93).
- Item 5: Highest value is for Agent 3 (67).
- Item 6: Highest value is for Agent 0 (97).
- Item 7: Highest value is for Agent 5 (90).
- Item 8: Highest value is for Agent 6 (82).

Now, let's format this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [0, 8],
    "7": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and items are allocated to agents who value them the most. Note that some agents might not receive any items due to their lower valuations compared to others.
