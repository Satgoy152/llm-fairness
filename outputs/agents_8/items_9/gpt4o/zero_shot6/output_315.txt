Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  24  77  21  54  45  47  50  37
1  13  39  53  57  60  92   0   2  86
2  25  83  83  73  66  42  20  58  11
3  69  99  48  61   5  43   1  64  51
4  22  58   1  37  85  43  41  87  39
5  71  73  18  31  22   8  92  35  24
6  72  57  49  35  38  69  24  19  47
7  12  10  64  49  86  70  91  44  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. One approach is to prioritize giving each item to the agent who values it the most, while also trying to ensure a balanced distribution among agents.

Let's determine the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 6 values it the most (72).
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most (99).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (77).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (57).
5. Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most (85).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (92).
7. Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most (92).
8. Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most (87).
9. Item 8: Agent 1 values it the most (86).

Now, let's check if the distribution is balanced. Currently, some agents have more items than others. Let's adjust it to ensure each agent has an integer number of items and the allocation is fair.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 3, 5, 8.
- Agent 2 gets no items.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets items 4 and 7.
- Agent 5 gets item 6.
- Agent 6 gets item 0.
- Agent 7 gets no items.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 5, 8],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0],
    "7": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
