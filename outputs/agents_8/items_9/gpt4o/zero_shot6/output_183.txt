Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  75  33  27  46   6  23  67  82
1  72  52   9  95  49  44  95  16  45
2  18  54  30  63  36  50  20  73  22
3  71  35  61  29  35   7  13  76  86
4  38  65  53  97  84  49  20  22  12
5  63  32  96  25  10  77  69  55  87
6  23  90  95  28  87  96   2  45   7
7  65  19  71   5  10  38  28  15  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to distribute the 9 items among the 8 agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items. We'll aim to distribute items based on maximizing the agents' valuations while also ensuring fair distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations to distribute items fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (75) and 8 (82).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (95).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (73).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 8 (86).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (97).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (96).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (96) and 1 (90).
8. **Agent 7**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (71).

Allocating based on the highest valuations:

- **Agent 0** gets item 1.
- **Agent 1** gets item 3.
- **Agent 2** gets item 7.
- **Agent 3** gets item 8.
- **Agent 4** gets item 4.
- **Agent 5** gets item 2.
- **Agent 6** gets item 5.
- **Agent 7** gets item 0.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, except one agent who gets none, and all items are distributed fairly based on their highest valuations.
