Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  36  30  63  77  94  36   4  12
1   0  84  53  14  57  57  25  49   8
2  49  62  14  93  85  91   4  47  89
3  51  67  46   7  19  91  81  94  27
4  76   0   0  92   2  55  89  67  41
5  62  79  38  54  86  57  80  62  44
6  60   8  21  60  22  56   9  27  81
7  10  34  69   1  51  86  52  67  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider maximizing each agent's happiness based on their valuations while ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Balance the distribution so that each agent receives a fair share.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most at 76.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 84.
- Item 2: Agent 7 values it the most at 69.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 93.
- Item 4: Agent 5 values it the most at 86.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 94.
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most at 89.
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most at 94.
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most at 89.

After this assignment, we verify that each agent receives at least one item, and adjust if necessary to ensure all agents have at least one item and the total number of items is 9.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [],
    "7": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items, with agent 6 receiving none due to the constraint of limited items.
