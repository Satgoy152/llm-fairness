Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  40  16  95  11  53  74  68  53
1  15  94  11  10  48  96  56  44  89
2   1  80  68  77  38  68  82  86   5
3  22  31  50  69  74   9  58  16  83
4  63  81  61  49  45  85  52  10  79
5   7  89  45  86  44  57  58   6  23
6  44  55  75  46  41  19  92  60  74
7  11  79  86  85  37  29  67  54  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 9 items allocated in total. A common approach could be to consider maximizing the total value each agent can get from their assigned items, ensuring a fair distribution. However, given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one. We will consider the highest value each agent places on an item to decide the allocation.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 95)
- Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 96)
- Agent 2 gets item 6 (value 82)
- Agent 3 gets item 8 (value 83)
- Agent 4 gets item 1 (value 81)
- Agent 5 gets item 2 (value 45)
- Agent 6 gets item 7 (value 60)
- Agent 7 gets items 0 and 4 (values 11 and 37, respectively)

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 8 agents, maximizing the individual values for each agent where possible.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [0, 4]
}
```
