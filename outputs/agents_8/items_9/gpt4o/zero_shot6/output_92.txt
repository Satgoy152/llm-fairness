Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  82  34  86   9  58  18  98  52
1  16  44  37  48  46  18  72  88  19
2  59  22  40  11  67  95  47  23  27
3  11  15  41  76  47  61  33  70  46
4  98  38  81  93   2  45   4  78  63
5   4  32  99  71  77  41  73  14  55
6  94  45  47  90  15  56  14  96  93
7  50  41  89   1  64  27  36  42  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider distributing them in a way that maximizes the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations. However, given the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items and the total number of items is 9, we should try to evenly distribute the items while considering the highest valuations possible for each agent.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Gets items [7, 3] (valuations: 98, 86)
- Agent 1: Gets items [6, 1] (valuations: 72, 44)
- Agent 2: Gets items [5] (valuation: 95)
- Agent 3: Gets items [8] (valuation: 46)
- Agent 4: Gets items [0] (valuation: 98)
- Agent 5: Gets items [2] (valuation: 99)
- Agent 6: Gets items [4] (valuation: 15)
- Agent 7: Gets no items

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4],
    "7": []
}
```
