Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21   8  79  67  75  17  87  43  55
1  96  32  96  91  15  62  38  93  84
2  53  81  92  92  48   7  40  87  56
3  81  11  37  51  76   4   9  56  54
4   8  42  39  56  32  96   5  12  29
5  54  41   9  60  25  29  89  86  23
6  44  19  31  58  87  33  73  78   9
7  64  14  27  44  81   1  20  20  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items.
2. Distribute items to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 6: 87.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0: 96.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2: 92.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4: 76.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 5: 96.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 7: 86.
7. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 3: 58.
8. Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 8: 59.
9. For the last item (1), allocate it to the agent with the highest remaining valuation who hasn't reached their fair share, which is agent 2 (81).

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [8]
}
```
