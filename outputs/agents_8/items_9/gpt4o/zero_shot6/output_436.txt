Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  68  87  76   9  66  26  78  47
1  64  44  80  56  83  78  20  42  76
2  98  20  78  71  84  39  57  96  96
3  95   9  11  83  27  27  76  11   7
4  64  88  73  53  80   6  68  91  49
5  22  71  31  89  91  51  73  84   4
6  28  81  83   2  54  85  68  65  71
7  91  16  60  80  57   0  44  30  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

One possible way to achieve this is by considering the highest values each agent has for available items and ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 87).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 83).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 98).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (value 83).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 88).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (value 51).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (value 85).
8. **Agent 7**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (value 80).

These allocations ensure each agent gets an item they highly value, and all items are fairly distributed with each agent receiving at least one item.

Allocating the remaining item:
- **Agent 0** also values item 8 (value 47) relatively highly compared to others.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.
