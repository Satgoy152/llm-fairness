Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  88  61  25  82  71   3  77  97
1  55  55  83  11  30  28  85  35   1
2  53   2  78  20   8  36  92  34  82
3  88  82  78  75  42  17  28  60  89
4   3  41  37  39  47  68  17  48   7
5  41  49  13  62  30  70  41  66  45
6  51  85  12  35  68   6  73  67  79
7  48  63  38  81  23  54  87  18  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize each agent's total value based on their preferences while ensuring that every item is allocated exactly once and each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s one way to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item whenever possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0 is most valued by agent 3 (88).
- Item 1 is most valued by agent 0 (88).
- Item 2 is most valued by agent 1 (83).
- Item 3 is most valued by agent 7 (81).
- Item 4 is most valued by agent 0 (82).
- Item 5 is most valued by agent 5 (70).
- Item 6 is most valued by agent 1 (85).
- Item 7 is most valued by agent 6 (67).
- Item 8 is most valued by agent 0 (97).

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [5]
- Agent 6: [7]
- Agent 7: [3]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 8],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [3]
}
```
