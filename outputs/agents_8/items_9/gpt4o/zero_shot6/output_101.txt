Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  20  49  99  79  99  32  14  49
1  79  30  73  22  51  10  98  40  45
2  69  65   5  66  39  98  37  87  65
3  27   5  84  26  35  83  48  80  29
4  27  88  88  84  82  94  50  58  15
5   3  71  38  40  17  90  84  46  97
6  23  90  10  49  29  36  49   9  10
7  59  57  25  52  10  55  55   1  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable distribution based on their valuations. Here is a simple way to allocate the items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and trying to maximize their satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 3 and 5 highly, so allocate item 3.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 6 the highest, so allocate item 6.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 5 the highest, so allocate item 5.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 2 the highest, so allocate item 2.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 1 and 2 the highest, but item 2 is taken, so allocate item 1.
6. **Agent 5:** Values item 8 the highest, so allocate item 8.
7. **Agent 6:** Values item 1 the highest, but item 1 is taken, so allocate item 0.
8. **Agent 7:** Values item 0, 6 and 5 highly, but those are taken, allocate item 4.

Each agent receives one item, but since Agent 0 has two highly valued items, they can receive the remaining item 7.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
