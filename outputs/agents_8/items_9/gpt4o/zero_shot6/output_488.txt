Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16   7  22  17  24  28  38  10  76
1  20  37  16   2  72  48  97  22  70
2  57  93  10  45  85  41  89  36  53
3  33  20   0   3  14  24  74  56  90
4  87  56  17  81  47  91  16  14   3
5  54  24  36  17  32  21  28   2  50
6  75  59   9   1   5  29  72  58  25
7  11   9  37  70  54  27  75  55  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 8, so allocate item 8 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 6, so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 1, so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 7, so allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 0, so allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 can be allocated item 5.
7. Agent 6 can be allocated item 3.
8. Agent 7 can be allocated item 4.
9. Allocate the remaining item 2 to Agent 5, as they have a decent valuation for it.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, with Agent 5 receiving two items to distribute all 9 items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 2],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [4]
}
```
