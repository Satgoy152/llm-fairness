Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  46  30  36  68  37  67  47  49
1  62   9   3  90  26  91  33   8  85
2  29  68  48  96  14  53  76  32  76
3   4  38  45  56  84   9  16  97  84
4  20  41  54  27  41  25  74  48  54
5  23  27  12  60  22  95   7  73  62
6  23  32  95  66  65  55  34  89  52
7  43  45  92  19  33  28  93  52  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the sum of values for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive none.

Below is a step-by-step approach to allocate items:

1. Start by prioritizing agents based on their highest valuations for items.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. Ensure no item is assigned more than once and each agent can be allocated an integer number of items.

Following this approach, here are the allocations:

1. Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 68).
2. Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 90).
3. Agent 2 gets item 6 (value 76).
4. Agent 3 gets item 7 (value 97).
5. Agent 4 gets item 2 (value 54).
6. Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 95).
7. Agent 6 gets item 1 (value 32).
8. Agent 7 gets items 0 and 8 (values 43 and 22).

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [0, 8]
}
```
