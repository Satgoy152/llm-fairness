Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  89  93  50  45  71  14  46   0
1  61  35  71  53   1  31  25  35  67
2  51  66  75  70  48   2  49  64   2
3  49  98  25  30  50  19  72  83  18
4  20  41  84  33  42  89  74  45  87
5  92  15  51  40   2  86  66  12  13
6  64  60  72  71  85  87  55   3  41
7  65  35  89  19  49  28  37  63  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and maximize the total value for each agent. Let's try to allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 1, and 2. Let's assign item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 can take item 8, where they have a relatively high valuation.
3. Agent 2 seems to value item 3 quite a bit. Let's assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a standout valuation for item 1. We'll assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 seems to value item 5 highly. Let's assign item 5 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 0 highly. Assign item 0 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 4 highly. Assign item 4 to agent 6.
8. Agent 7 has a high valuation for item 6. Assign item 6 to agent 7.
9. Agent 0 can also take item 7 as they have a decent valuation for it.

Let's wrap this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
