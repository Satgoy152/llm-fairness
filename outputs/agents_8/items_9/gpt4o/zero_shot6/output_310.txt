Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  11  85  34  89  30  16  52  84
1  39  72  32  58  41  84   5  80  65
2   0  68  87  56  81   0  50  55  12
3  20  20  74  64  86   5  19   0  63
4  93  32  56  97  20  12   2  76  85
5  94  51   5  55  29   1  70  21  91
6  33  72  93  36  21  31  76  41   5
7  91  49  80  28  83  75   0  29  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider both the valuations and the requirement that each agent receives an integer number of items. We have a total of 9 items to allocate among 8 agents. Weâ€™ll aim to distribute these items as fairly as possible based on the valuations given:

1. **Initial Observations:**
    - There are 9 items and 8 agents, so each agent should receive at least one item, but one agent will receive two items to ensure all items are distributed.

2. **Fair Allocation Strategy:**
    - We can start by assigning each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation. This might not always be possible for all agents, depending on overlaps in maximum valuations.
    - We then adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item and resolve any conflicts by considering secondary high valuations.

3. **Step-by-Step Allocation:**
    - **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (95).
    - **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (84).
    - **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (87).
    - **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (86).
    - **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (97).
    - **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 8 (91).
    - **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (76).
    - **Agent 7**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (91), but item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest is item 4 (83), but it's allocated to Agent 3. Allocating item 1 (49) to Agent 7, as it has not been allocated yet.

4. **Resolve Conflicts and Ensure Full Allocation:**
    - After initial allocation, we notice that all items have been allocated except for item 7.
    - Agent 3 can be allocated item 7 in addition to item 4 since they have a high valuation for item 7 (0 compared to others).

5. **Final Allocation:**
    - Ensure each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed fairly based on the initial strategy we employed.
