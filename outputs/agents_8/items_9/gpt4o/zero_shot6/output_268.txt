Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  70  55  80  64  76  57  27   0
1  77   1  52  50  76  89  74  50  85
2  32  78  36  49  68  96  83  96  16
3  85   9  25  32  10  90  70  19  38
4  49  92  71  52   9  16  16  69  74
5  38  37  49  78  81  68  36  23  73
6  39  17  12  62  59  74  14  33  50
7  42  57  61  44  90  74  94  84  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one could consider maximizing the total value of the items assigned to each agent. However, since the goal is to ensure a fair distribution where each agent gets an integer number of items and there are 9 items in total, we need to assign each item to one agent only. 

Here is a potential allocation based on maximizing each agent's perceived value of the items:

1. Agent 0 receives item 3 (value: 80).
2. Agent 1 receives item 5 (value: 89).
3. Agent 2 receives item 7 (value: 96).
4. Agent 3 receives item 0 (value: 85).
5. Agent 4 receives item 1 (value: 92).
6. Agent 5 receives item 4 (value: 81).
7. Agent 6 receives item 8 (value: 50).
8. Agent 7 receives item 6 (value: 94).
9. Agent 7 also receives item 2 (value: 61) as they have a high valuation for multiple items.

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one high-valued item according to their own valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated without overlap. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [6, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the 8 agents fairly, considering their valuations.
