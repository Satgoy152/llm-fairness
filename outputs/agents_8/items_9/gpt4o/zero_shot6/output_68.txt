Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  95  54  88  26  17  92  99   8
1  24  82  61  24  72  94  80  55  69
2  34  44  80  31  68  94  69  12  92
3  87  96  26  11  92  94  29  25   8
4  85  37  73  42   0  18  16  55  25
5  61  47  24   3  58   2  14  40   7
6  43   9  91  62  51  61  40  25  59
7  81  56  38  50  35  14  32  81  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute the items such that the allocations are balanced or as fair as possible. Given the table, let's try to allocate items to maximize the total satisfaction or value each agent receives, while ensuring every item is allocated:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 7. Let's allocate items 0 and 7 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 highly. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 doesn't have any very high valuations, but let's allocate item 8 to Agent 5 for balance.
7. Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 6. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 6.
8. Agent 7 has a high valuation for item 3. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [3]
}
```
