Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  71   9  22  83  43  19  27  57
1  77  58  40  47  35  67  45  60  21
2  44  72  95  25  77  76  22  42  69
3  84  52   5  61  36  86  39  36  35
4  70  96  11  17  87  92  14  38  40
5  31  55  40  54  15  14  93  72  41
6  57  43  76  20  80  50  78  69  41
7  11  15  30  14   9  73  22  44  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy where each agent gets the item that they value the most, ensuring that all items are allocated and no agent receives more than one item (since there are 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive 2 items).

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 4 (value: 83)
2. Agent 1: Item 0 (value: 77)
3. Agent 2: Item 2 (value: 95)
4. Agent 3: Item 5 (value: 86)
5. Agent 4: Item 1 (value: 96)
6. Agent 5: Item 6 (value: 93)
7. Agent 6: Item 3 (value: 20)
8. Agent 7: Item 8 (value: 96)

Now, we have one item left to allocate (item 7). We can assign it to the agent who values it the most among those who have only received one item. Agent 1 values item 7 at 60, which is the highest among those agents who have received only one item.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated, and at least one agent receives two items.
