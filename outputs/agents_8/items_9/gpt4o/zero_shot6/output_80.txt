Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  54  86  38  42  18  64  75  72
1  90  48  18  27  66  28  54  22  48
2  84   1  28  53  21  99  38  35  79
3  85  15  42  41  26  17  96  91  61
4  97  33  17  86  60  50  83  42  38
5  99  67  56  44  64  65  93  24  96
6  37  72  43  51  26  94  54  27  42
7  66  65  90  59  52  48  12  58  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent can receive an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 8 agents, one of the agents will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Valuations - 87, 54, 86, 38, 42, 18, 64, 75, 72
- Agent 1: Valuations - 90, 48, 18, 27, 66, 28, 54, 22, 48
- Agent 2: Valuations - 84, 1, 28, 53, 21, 99, 38, 35, 79
- Agent 3: Valuations - 85, 15, 42, 41, 26, 17, 96, 91, 61
- Agent 4: Valuations - 97, 33, 17, 86, 60, 50, 83, 42, 38
- Agent 5: Valuations - 99, 67, 56, 44, 64, 65, 93, 24, 96
- Agent 6: Valuations - 37, 72, 43, 51, 26, 94, 54, 27, 42
- Agent 7: Valuations - 66, 65, 90, 59, 52, 48, 12, 58, 36

Possible Allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0 (Value: 87)
- Agent 1 gets Item 4 (Value: 66)
- Agent 2 gets Item 5 (Value: 99)
- Agent 3 gets Item 6 (Value: 96)
- Agent 4 gets Item 3 (Value: 86)
- Agent 5 gets Item 8 (Value: 96)
- Agent 6 gets Item 1 (Value: 72)
- Agent 7 gets Item 2 (Value: 90), Item 7 (Value: 58)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, with Agent 7 receiving two items because the total number of items exceeds the number of agents.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [2, 7]
}
```
