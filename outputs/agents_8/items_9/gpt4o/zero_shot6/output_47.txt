Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50   7  64  30   0  88  43  24  19
1  13  55  66  54  75  38  33   0  59
2   7  98   6  14  49  91  23  48  77
3  39   5  29  31  42  61  22  67  26
4  14  49  67  68  23  66   3   1  48
5  75  16  32  66  66  69  24  36  24
6  89  52   5  31  95  83  61  73  18
7  34  64  87  70   7  70  23  74  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We can use a simple greedy approach to distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent.

Let's walk through a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 5 (valuation 88). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 (valuation 75). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 (valuation 98). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 7 (valuation 67). Assign item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 3 (valuation 68). Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for Agent 5 is item 0 (valuation 75). Assign item 0 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value for Agent 6 is item 4, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 5 (valuation 83), but it's also taken. Next available is item 6 (valuation 61). Assign item 6 to Agent 6.
8. **Agent 7**: The highest value for Agent 7 is item 2 (valuation 87). Assign item 2 to Agent 7.

This allocation gives us 8 items distributed among the agents. The remaining item, item 8, should be assigned to the agent who values it the most and hasn't already received an item with a higher valuation. Agent 2 values item 8 highest among the remaining unallocated items with 77, but since Agent 2 already has item 1 with a valuation of 98, we can assign item 8 to Agent 7 who values it at 75.

Now, all 9 items are allocated fairly. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [2, 8]
}
```
