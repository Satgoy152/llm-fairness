Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  52  56  11  48  41  43  92  37
1  69  78  66  78  58  54  71  25  64
2  75  53  29  61  33  93  20  46  12
3  31  20  66  27  54  24  15  81  52
4  14   9  11  94  44  74  58  13  94
5  37  69   0  45  89  16  77  66   4
6   6  46  83  82  35  37  81  48  53
7  27  65  43  77  89  93  19  78  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items equals nine. A possible approach is to assign each agent the item that they value the most, then allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution as much as possible. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 the most (value 92).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (value 78).
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most (value 93).
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the most (value 81), but it is already taken, so we allocate item 2 (value 66).
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the most (value 94).
6. Agent 5 values item 4 the most (value 89).
7. Agent 6 values item 2 the most (value 83), but it is already taken, so we allocate item 3 (value 82).
8. Agent 7 values item 5 the most (value 93), but it is already taken, so we allocate item 4 (value 89).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items. We have already allocated items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. The items 0, 6, and 8 are left.

9. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
10. Allocate item 6 to Agent 6.
11. Allocate item 8 to Agent 4.

This ensures that all items are allocated, and agents receive a fair share, considering their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 8],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6],
    "7": []
}
```
