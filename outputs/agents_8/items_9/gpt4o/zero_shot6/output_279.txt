Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23   1  69  37  45  44  52  97  32
1  71  77  48   4  41  84  65  52  53
2  71  94  55  40  26   6  69  50  78
3  61  76  14  89   1  16  89  23  23
4  25  20   4  85  48   6  74  82  99
5  74  41  23  44  36  77  74  44  30
6  28  49  48  11  28   5  18  85  44
7  27  52  73  15  93  81  76  29  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers the preferences (valuations) of each agent for the items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the constraint of having 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each.

We will use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. Once an agent has been assigned an item, they will not receive another item until each agent has received at least one item, after which the remaining item will be allocated to the agent with the next highest valuation.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. Allocate the remaining item to the agent with the next highest valuation for an item they haven't been allocated yet.

Below is the allocation based on the above method:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. Agent 7 receives two items because they have the highest valuation for items 2 and 4, ensuring fairness in distribution.
