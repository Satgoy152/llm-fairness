Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  13  68  20  58  80  75   9  52
1  60  61  17  24  29  79  73  78  56
2  95  41  90  40  82   8  94  22  23
3   9  66  30  52  66  60  50  27  54
4  86  16  30  34  76  69  86  21  65
5  34  68  41  83  64  47  95  24  16
6  30   9  68  55  60  16  26  65  92
7  11  33  25  24  83  72  97  90  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed. Given there are 9 items to allocate among 8 agents, some agents will receive one item, and one agent will receive two items.

Let's approach this problem by iteratively assigning items to agents based on their valuations:

1. **Assign item 5 to agent 0:** Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 80.
2. **Assign item 6 to agent 5:** Agent 5 values item 6 the highest at 95.
3. **Assign item 2 to agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 90.
4. **Assign item 0 to agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 0 second highest after item 2, at 95.
5. **Assign item 7 to agent 7:** Agent 7 values item 7 the highest at 90.
6. **Assign item 4 to agent 4:** Agent 4 values item 4 the highest at 76.
7. **Assign item 8 to agent 6:** Agent 6 values item 8 the highest at 92.
8. **Assign item 1 to agent 1:** Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 61.
9. **Assign item 3 to agent 3:** Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 52.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and one agent receives two items (agent 2), while considering each agent's preferences. Now, we will present the allocations in the requested JSON format.

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [7]
}
```
