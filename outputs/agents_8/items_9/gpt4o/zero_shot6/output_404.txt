Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  23  37  29  44  82  61  88  77
1  52  60  11  21  64   6  30  84  20
2  84  20  44  42  86  38  81  87  28
3  34  87  55  77  18  29  11  32  26
4  51  45   5  78  97   1  93  23  76
5   1  17  23  37  81  21  17   6  92
6  82  33  92   0  92  62  78  14  40
7   8  69  99  65  44   3  44  24  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. One possible method is to allocate based on the highest valuation for each item. This approach tries to maximize the total value derived from the items by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

First, let's determine the allocations based on the highest valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest at 84.
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it the highest at 87.
3. Item 2: Agent 7 values it the highest at 99.
4. Item 3: Agent 4 values it the highest at 78.
5. Item 4: Agent 4 values it the highest at 97.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest at 82.
7. Item 6: Agent 4 values it the highest at 93.
8. Item 7: Agent 2 values it the highest at 87.
9. Item 8: Agent 5 values it the highest at 92.

Now, let's ensure that all agents are included in the allocation, even if they receive no items, and present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4, 6],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [],
    "7": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, and all 9 items are allocated, with each agent listed even if they receive no items.
