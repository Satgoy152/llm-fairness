Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  25  80  21  79  66  80  57  23
1  69  85  64  22  45  97  30  76  47
2  62  18  89  95  32  49  44  82  52
3  74  66  97  86  63  37  96  18  30
4   6  43  49  57  97  48   3  34  26
5   2  83   5  54  51  73   7  35  41
6  24  62  69  38  50  87  87   9  66
7  52  20  49  39  77  85  96  84  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Given that there are 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will end up with two items. We can use a simple greedy strategy to allocate the items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them. Here's the allocation process:

1. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2, which is 97. Assign item 2 to agent 3.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5, which is 97. Assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 4, which is 97. Assign item 4 to agent 4.
4. Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 6, which is 96. Assign item 6 to agent 7.
5. Agent 3 has the next highest valuation for item 6, which is 96, but it's already taken. Agent 3 also has a high valuation for item 0, which is 74. Assign item 0 to agent 3.
6. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2, which is 80, but it's already taken. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 6, which is 80, but it's also taken. Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 4, which is 79, but it's taken. Assign item 8 to agent 0, as it is available and has a reasonable valuation of 23.
7. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3, which is 95. Assign item 3 to agent 2.
8. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 5, which is 87, but it's taken. Assign item 7 to agent 6, as it is available and has a reasonable valuation of 9.
9. Agent 5 is left without any items. The remaining item is 1, assign it to agent 5.

This allocation process ensures each agent gets items based on their highest available valuations, with at least one agent receiving two items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [6]
}
```
