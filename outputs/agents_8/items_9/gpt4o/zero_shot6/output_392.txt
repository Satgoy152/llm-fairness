Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  76  65  68  73  67  45  19  65
1  23  76  65  13  67  62   2  64  76
2  48  72  62  71  14  99  76   7  75
3  67  32  90  30  73  11  68  97  78
4  30  74  48  35  86  26  78  83  77
5  34  96  86  11   9  19   4  70  83
6  36  95  95  33  15  62  44  73  47
7  33  49  68  62  76  97  38  14   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning the highest-valued items to them based on their preferences, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item that hasn't been assigned yet.
2. Once each agent has at least one item, continue assigning items based on remaining highest values until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign item 4 (73) and item 3 (68)
- Agent 1: Assign item 8 (76)
- Agent 2: Assign item 5 (99)
- Agent 3: Assign item 2 (90)
- Agent 4: Assign item 6 (78)
- Agent 5: Assign item 1 (96)
- Agent 6: Assign item 0 (36)
- Agent 7: Assign item 7 (14)

Now, let's convert this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent is assigned at least one item and all items are allocated.
