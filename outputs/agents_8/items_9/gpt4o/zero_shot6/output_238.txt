Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  96  86  18   4  60  97  14  27
1   4  90  25  11  96  82  66  22  60
2   5  86  25  38  55  41  50  28  62
3  58  45  20  95  43  51  27   1   4
4  33  18   4  36  82   1  64  82   4
5  82  62  12  63  36  44  61  65  42
6  12  12  88  21   8  44  93  70   6
7  35   5  77  46  85  92  86  41  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated in total. 

A balanced approach is to give each agent at least one item, with some agents potentially receiving more than one if it results in a better fit for their valuations.

Let's go through the list and assign the items to agents based on their valuations, attempting to maximize the total satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives item 6 (97) - highest valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 4 (96) - highest valuation.
3. **Agent 2**: Receives item 8 (62) - highest valuation available.
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 3 (95) - highest valuation.
5. **Agent 4**: Receives item 7 (82) - highest valuation.
6. **Agent 5**: Receives item 0 (82) - highest valuation.
7. **Agent 6**: Receives item 2 (88) - highest valuation.
8. **Agent 7**: Receives item 5 (92) - highest valuation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives one item and maximizes their respective valuations according to the given table.
