Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  79  55  95  39  91  16  56  72
1  44  41  86  85  67   8  92  16  42
2  30  41  47   2   0  63  12  88  51
3  69  25  23   7  88  97  48  39   6
4  79  11  73  41  66  73   2  90  12
5   3  53  25  98  19  20  45   6  84
6  23  55  27   7  98  59  61  76  40
7  30  83  94  41  53  29  37  39   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 8 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has for any unassigned item, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
2. Balance the allocation so that all items are distributed among the agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 3 (95).
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 2 (86).
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 7 (88).
- Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 5 (97).
- Agent 4: Highest valuation is for item 0 (79).
- Agent 5: Highest valuation is for item 3 (98), but it's already taken, so choose item 8 (84).
- Agent 6: Highest valuation is for item 4 (98).
- Agent 7: Highest valuation is for item 2 (94), but it's already taken, so choose item 1 (83).

Now, checking the allocation:
- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Items left: 6 (not yet allocated)

Agent 6 can take item 6, as it is not yet allocated, and they have a relatively high valuation for it (61).

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [4, 6],
    "7": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 9 items allocated.
