Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  51  80  21   3  89   8   6  28
1  74  49  39  62  13  98   9  93  23
2  66  80  52  19  60  54  69  22  25
3  47  16  79  32  79  25  34  64  91
4  38  33  43  37  15  58   8  31  12
5  79  98  36   0  69  65  68  70  11
6  32  25  34  59  96  66  68  20  41
7  35   7  45  19  85  22  58  33  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. Given that there are 8 agents and 9 items, most agents will receive one item, while one agent will receive two items. Let's aim to allocate the items in a way that reflects the valuations and provides a fair distribution.

Here is a possible allocation based on the table provided:

1. Start by finding the highest value for each item and allocate that item to the agent with the highest valuation for it.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, where possible, and that only one agent receives two items.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [3, 7],
    "7": [2]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 8.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.
- Agent 5 gets item 0.
- Agent 6 gets items 3 and 7.
- Agent 7 gets item 2.

This ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item. Agent 6 receives two items, as they have relatively high valuations for those items.
