Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  74  71  59  49  50  22  80  11
1  46  82  77  90  93  93  29  41  94
2  24  98   7  95  74  56  58  78  47
3  74   2  16  57  77  54  61  99  38
4  13  91  64  40  46  59  89  89  49
5  71  65  55  12  67  14   7  81  31
6  80  62  30  11  47  42  16  27  41
7  44  59  58  41   8  28  57  18  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach where we assign items to agents based on maximizing their valuations. We aim to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Based on the table provided, here is one possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 6 (value 80)
- Item 1: Agent 2 (value 98)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (value 77)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (value 90)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (value 93)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (value 93)
- Item 6: Agent 4 (value 89)
- Item 7: Agent 3 (value 99)
- Item 8: Agent 1 (value 94)

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while keeping in mind that each agent can have an integer number of items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3, 4, 5, 8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0],
    "7": []
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents, with agent 1 receiving the most items due to the high valuation on multiple items.
