Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  49  53  44  71  72  74  10  90
1  85  75  78  63  99  71  96  30  62
2  48  98  66  60  91  76  31   0  76
3  37  31  98  77  70  32  88  22  57
4  17  57  98  96  28   5  26  53  60
5  70   3  53  28  38  38  51  81  90
6  99  71  29  83  31   6  10  48  14
7  96  90  75  33  35   9   2  84  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations. 

First, let's consider a strategy to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each unallocated item. We'll ensure that every agent gets at least one item, and then assign additional items to agents with higher valuation for remaining items.

1. Find the highest valuation for each item, and allocate the item to that agent.
2. If any agent has more than one item while another has none, consider possible swaps or reallocations to ensure each agent has at least one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation is by agent 6 (value 99).
2. Item 1: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 98).
3. Item 2: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (value 98).
4. Item 3: Highest valuation is by agent 4 (value 96).
5. Item 4: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 99).
6. Item 5: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 76).
7. Item 6: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (value 88).
8. Item 7: Highest valuation is by agent 7 (value 84).
9. Item 8: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 90).

Now let's check the allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 8
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5
- Agent 3: Items 2, 6
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: No item yet
- Agent 6: Item 0
- Agent 7: Item 7

Agent 5 has not been allocated any item, so we need to make an adjustment. We can reallocate one item from an agent with multiple items:

- Reallocate item 5 from agent 2 to agent 5.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 8
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 2, 6
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Item 5
- Agent 6: Item 0
- Agent 7: Item 7

Now we present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [7]
}
```
