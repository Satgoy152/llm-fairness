Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  48   7  85  76  50  50  39  79
1  82  15   0  30  44  79  16  48  80
2  25  49   2  26  91  32  56  52  35
3  38  80  80  33  12  91  23  53  18
4  82  60   0  70  63  80  90  54  92
5  55  72  21  39  38  91  93  78   6
6  44   8  86   9  85  99  64  28   5
7  40  42  33  22  59  18   1  64  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple round-robin method, while also considering the preferences of each agent. However, since only 9 items need to be allocated among 8 agents, one agent will receive two items, and the rest will receive one each.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent one item based on the highest value they have for any item.
2. Assign the remaining item to the agent who values it the highest, considering that they haven't already received an item they highly value.

Here's the allocation based on this strategy:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (value 85).
- Agent 1 highly values item 8 (value 80).
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 (value 91).
- Agent 3 highly values item 5 (value 91).
- Agent 4 highly values item 8, but since it's already taken by Agent 1, we look at the next highest item 6 (value 90).
- Agent 5 highly values item 5, but since it's already taken by Agent 3, we look at the next highest item 6, but it's taken by Agent 4, so we assign item 1 (value 72).
- Agent 6 highly values item 5, but since it's already taken by Agent 3, we look at the next highest item 2 (value 86).
- Agent 7 highly values item 7 (value 64).

Now, we have allocated items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. One item (item 0) is left unallocated. We'll assign it to the agent who values it most and hasn't already received a highly valued item.

- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value 82), so they will receive it as their second item.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, with one agent receiving an additional item, for a total of 9 items allocated.
