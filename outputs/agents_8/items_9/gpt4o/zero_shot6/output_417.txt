Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78   3  30  64  14  97  67  91  54
1  65  45  68  71  94  11  79   2  10
2  40  54   2  22  61  45  39  66  96
3  42  16  67  84  69  24  96  28  44
4  55  25  67  84  41  82  40  45  95
5  92  59  80  47  72  72  17  15  19
6  25   1  85  31  88   2   4  37  52
7  31  34  76  55   7  85  16  99   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items to agents, we will attempt to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

To achieve this, I'll use a simple greedy approach, assigning each item to the agent who values it the most and not yet overloaded with items. Given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, each agent can get at least one item, and one agent can get two items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0 has the highest value with Agent 5 (92).
2. Item 1 has the highest value with Agent 5 (59).
3. Item 2 has the highest value with Agent 5 (80).
4. Item 3 has the highest value with Agent 3 (84).
5. Item 4 has the highest value with Agent 1 (94).
6. Item 5 has the highest value with Agent 0 (97).
7. Item 6 has the highest value with Agent 3 (96).
8. Item 7 has the highest value with Agent 7 (99).
9. Item 8 has the highest value with Agent 2 (96).

Now, let's check if each agent has at least one item and adjust if needed:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 8
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6
- Agent 4: None
- Agent 5: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 6: None
- Agent 7: Item 7

Adjustments:
- Since Agent 4 and Agent 6 have no items, let's reallocate some items.
- Reallocate Item 1 from Agent 5 to Agent 4.
- Reallocate Item 2 from Agent 5 to Agent 6.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, with a total of 9 items allocated.
