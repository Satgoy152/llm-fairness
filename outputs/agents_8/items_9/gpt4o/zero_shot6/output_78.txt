Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  51  11  19  87  33  91  30  90
1  50  35  53   2  49  49  41  67  89
2  66  41   1  39  94  80  58  96  69
3  32  47  59   4  45  29  37  77  75
4   4  69  25  82  54  12   6  52  36
5  79  16  12   8  12  73  12  19  41
6  90  93  50  29  49  11  50   5  39
7  30  15  67  16  21  17  26   8  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation process:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's go through each item and allocate accordingly:

- **Item 0**: Agent 6 values it the highest (90).
- **Item 1**: Agent 6 again values it the highest (93).
- **Item 2**: Agent 7 values it the highest (67).
- **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it the highest (82).
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the highest (94).
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the highest (80).
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the highest (91).
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the highest (96).
- **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it the highest (90).

After this allocation, we need to ensure every agent gets at least one integer number of items, so we reassess and adjust where possible to ensure fairness and integer allocation.

Let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4, 5, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 1],
    "7": [2]
}
```

This ensures that each agent has an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
