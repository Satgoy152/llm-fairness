Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  92  43   5  33  55   0  17  44
1  51  91  49  49  75  21  67  79  78
2  93  95  84  40  30  55   8  47  54
3  23   3  87  90  86  85  65  51  69
4  37  32  15  32  55  82   3  28  34
5  69  90  46  20   1  51   5  60  41
6   8  12  59   7  59  44  28  85  97
7  72  99  26  14   0  50   9  81  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a somewhat balanced share of their valued items, considering the distinct valuations. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, most agents will receive one item, but one agent will receive two items.

Here is one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 1.
- Agent 2 receives item 0.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives item 5.
- Agent 5 receives item 7.
- Agent 6 receives item 8.
- Agent 7 receives items 2 and 6.

This allocation attempts to balance the distributions based on their individual valuations.

    "6": [8],

}
