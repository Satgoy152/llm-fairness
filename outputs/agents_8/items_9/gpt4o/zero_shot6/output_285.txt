Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  78  11  15  20  74  71  44  67
1  37  76  30  56  15  85  82  21  87
2   4  71  86  59  69  38  85  22  31
3  91  56   2  16  12  18  26  81  99
4  44  83  12   2  85  78  82  31  72
5  91  94  45  55  73  47  55  94  56
6  64  90  55   2  61  92  29   7   6
7  88   6  88  20  83  77  19  60  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives at least one item. However, since there are 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive two items. We will try to distribute the items such that the total valuation each agent gets is relatively balanced.

One approach is to assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation and then adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item.

### Allocation Process:
1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 1 (78).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 8 (87).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 2 (86).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 8 (99), but it's already taken, so next highest is item 0 (91).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 4 (85).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 1 (94), but it's already taken, so next highest is item 0 (91), but it's already taken, so next highest is item 7 (94).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value is for item 5 (92).
8. **Agent 7**: Highest value is for item 2 (88), but it's already taken, so next highest is item 0 (88), but it's already taken, so next highest is item 4 (83), but it's already taken, so next highest is item 7 (60), but it's already taken, so next highest is item 3 (20).

### Adjustments:
- Agent 3 has only one high valuation item, item 0, which is already taken. Assign item 6 (26) as it is the next highest.
- Agent 5 should get the remaining unallocated item, which is item 3 (55).

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7, 3],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all 9 items are allocated.
