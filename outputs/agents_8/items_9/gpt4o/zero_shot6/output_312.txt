Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  49  60  77   6  31  19  37  26
1  89  15  29  17  49  92  65  51  93
2  74  32  83  83   5  61  98   2  26
3  82  21  51  11  86  50  65   3  77
4  22  71  83  39  45  41  72  23  13
5  29  89  91  44   8  59  22  32  63
6  80   3  57  54  68  25   7  79  17
7  30  94  79  98  42  69  52  79  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a relatively fair share according to their preferences. Since there are 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one item each.

Let's approach this step by step:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 3. Give Agent 0 item 0.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 5 and 8. Give Agent 1 item 8.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 6. Give Agent 2 item 6.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 4. Give Agent 3 item 4.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 2. Give Agent 4 item 2.
6. **Agent 5** has high valuations for items 1 and 2. Since item 2 is already allocated, give Agent 5 item 1.
7. **Agent 6** has a high valuation for item 0, but it's already allocated. The next high valuation is item 4, but it's also allocated. Give Agent 6 item 7, which is the next highest.
8. **Agent 7** has high valuations for items 1 and 3. Since item 1 is allocated, give Agent 7 item 3.
9. Item 5 is left unallocated, so we can give it to Agent 1 as they have a high valuation for it and can receive a second item.

Hereâ€™s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [8, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets their most valued or next best available item, with Agent 1 receiving two items due to their high valuation for both item 8 and item 5.
