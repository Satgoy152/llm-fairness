Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  15  62  22  32  85  96  95  75
1  38  80  77  63  34  39   6  27  43
2  39  27  90  52  64   2  46  81  83
3  40  14  48  20  44  99  63  80  26
4  65  10  58  96  89  80   8  43  39
5  95  46   8  43  22  43  38  56   5
6  34   5  62   7  28  32  63  56   6
7  96  45  98  69  90  25  14  52  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an opportunity to receive some items, but since there are only 9 items and 8 agents, at least one agent will receive more than one item. We should aim to maximize the total value for the agents, possibly distributing the items based on each agent's highest preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 6 (96) and item 7 (95).
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1 (80).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 (90) the most.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 (99) the most.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 (96) the most.
6. Agent 5 values item 0 (95) the most.
7. Agent 6 could take item 4 (28) as it's relatively more valuable for other agents.
8. Agent 7 highly values item 8 (83).

We can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [6, 7]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [0]
- Agent 6: [4]
- Agent 7: [8]

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and attempts to maximize agent satisfaction based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [8]
}
```
