Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  21  39  58  41   9  45  93  88
1  34   1  78  23  99  38  31  96  17
2  45  65   5  42  27  57  39  41  48
3  28  93   1  59  28  48  83  17  54
4  90  96  49  37   6  98   3   2  92
5  18  92  85  35  90  67  74  82  90
6  16  20  82  11  39  30  44  65  74
7  15  33  22   5  18  40  93  52  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we'll try to distribute the items so that each agent gets an item that they value relatively highly. However, since there are fewer items than agents, some agents will inevitably end up with no items. Our goal is to ensure that the allocation is done in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. **Create a list of all items and their values for each agent.**
2. **Sort the items for each agent based on their valuations.**
3. **Allocate items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.**
4. **Ensure every agent is included in the allocation, even if they receive no items.**

After evaluating the valuations, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (93).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (99).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (65).
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly (93), but it's already taken by Agent 2, so we allocate item 6 (83) instead.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most (96), but it's already taken, so item 5 (98) is allocated.
- Agent 5 values item 4 highly (90), but it's already taken, so item 2 (85) is allocated.
- Agent 6 values item 8 the most (74).
- Agent 7 values item 6 the most (93), but it's already taken, so item 8 (69) is allocated to them.

Given the constraints and aiming for a fair distribution, here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item they highly value, with the exception of Agent 6 who receives no items due to the limited number of items.
