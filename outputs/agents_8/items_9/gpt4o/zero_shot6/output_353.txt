Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  41  39  88  87  84  79  37  96
1  19   6  47   8  23  40  63  81  95
2  85  88  46  99  39  47  74  43   1
3  65  46  99  24  82  67  94  12  70
4  10  81  57  90  71  72  85  56  39
5  15   9  30  36  10  33  74  73  95
6  90  25  46  64  99  81  68  42  52
7  33  91   2  20  26  93  67  47  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of high-valued items according to their preferences. Let's distribute the items, trying to maximize each agent's total value based on their valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 3 (value 88)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 8 (value 95)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 0 (value 85)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 (value 99)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 4 (value 71)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 7 (value 73)
7. **Agent 6**: Item 5 (value 81)
8. **Agent 7**: Item 1 (value 91)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their happiness based on the highest valuations. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [1]
}
```
