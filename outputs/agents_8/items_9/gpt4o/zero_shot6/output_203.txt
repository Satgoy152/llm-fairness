Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  58  12  11  49  88  46  58  38
1   1  69  65   4   6  11   2  76  21
2  87  69  73  26  32   8  54  64  86
3  44  67  80  25  52  21  17  50  87
4  64  30  13  92  33  95  33  54  57
5  69   8  19  83  80   4  81  38  30
6  55  87  30   7  34   0  98  17  89
7  57  66  50   5  20  50  62  34  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the table and allocate the items to the agents accordingly.

First, let's identify the highest valuations for each item and allocate them accordingly:

- Item 0 has a highest valuation of 87 by agent 2.
- Item 1 has a highest valuation of 87 by agent 6.
- Item 2 has a highest valuation of 80 by agent 3.
- Item 3 has a highest valuation of 92 by agent 4.
- Item 4 has a highest valuation of 80 by agent 5.
- Item 5 has a highest valuation of 95 by agent 4.
- Item 6 has a highest valuation of 98 by agent 6.
- Item 7 has a highest valuation of 76 by agent 1.
- Item 8 has a highest valuation of 89 by agent 6.

From this, we can allocate as follows, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0: No items have a high valuation by Agent 0.
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [3, 5]
- Agent 5: [4]
- Agent 6: [1, 6, 8]
- Agent 7: No items have a high valuation by Agent 7.

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1, 6, 8],
    "7": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the agents while maximizing their individual valuations.
