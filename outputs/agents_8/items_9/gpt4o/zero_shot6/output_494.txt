Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  86  90   2  35  70   4  39  38
1  41  84  47  67  57  40  58  78  11
2  34  73   4   6  22  17  16   4  84
3  85  78  11  97   9  37  60  97  52
4  94  53  10  62  96  64  74  90  82
5  38   6  87  31  51  48  83  93  70
6  62  68  33  19  16  70  85  46  83
7  68  17  94  92  53  39  84  14  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that only 9 items are allocated in total. Since there are more agents than items, some agents will not receive any items. 

A fair allocation strategy could be to give each agent the item they value the most, or to distribute items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. However, given that only 9 items are available, not every agent will receive an item. 

Let's proceed by considering the highest valuation for each agent and try to allocate items in a balanced manner. 

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 8 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 6 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 7 values item 2 the most (but item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, so let's consider their next highest value).

Since Agent 7's highest value item 2 is already taken, their next highest valued item is item 0, which we can allocate to them.

Now, let's check if each item is allocated once, and all 9 items are allocated:

- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 (8 items allocated).
  
We need one more item to be allocated. Let's assign item 5 to Agent 0 as their second highest value item.

Now, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at most their most preferred item, and all items are distributed.
