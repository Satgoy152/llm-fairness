Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  21  68  97  99   4   8  46  32
1  57  98   6  61   5  15  11  59  44
2  86  12  83  32  78  27  91  91   3
3   2  26  29  32  90  14  24  57  44
4  32  43  81  67  18   3   5  36  98
5  22  47  62  56  79  85  60  87  81
6  19   4  87   8  40  27  11  56  59
7  12  83  53  74  35  99  70  33  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences for the items. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items.

Let's consider allocating items one by one, trying to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 3 (97)
2. Agent 1: Item 1 (98)
3. Agent 2: Item 6 (91)
4. Agent 3: Item 4 (90)
5. Agent 4: Item 8 (98)
6. Agent 5: Item 5 (85)
7. Agent 6: Item 2 (87)
8. Agent 7: Item 7 (33)
9. Since Agent 7 has the lowest total valuation, allocate an additional item to them: Item 0 (12)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and priorities are given to the items with the highest valuations for each agent. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [7, 0]
}
```
