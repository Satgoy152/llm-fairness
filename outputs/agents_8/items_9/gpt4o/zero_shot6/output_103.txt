Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  57   3  83  52  17  10  47  95
1  83  26  84  84  42   6  81  97  28
2  90  18  68   0  82  78  85  45  49
3  57  18  55  44  46  31  57  64  64
4  48  21  79  67  54  30  41   3  45
5  63  85  25  34  55  19  52   7  91
6   0  35  88  12  36  60  79  59  48
7  61  51  18  23  55  27  45  73  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll consider the highest value each agent assigns to an item, and try to allocate that item to the respective agent. However, since there are more agents than items, some agents might not receive any items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 8 highest (95), so allocate item 8 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 highest (97), so allocate item 7 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 highest (90), so allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 highest, but it's already taken, so allocate their next highest, item 8 (64), to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 highest (79), so allocate item 2 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 highest (85), so allocate item 1 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 2 highest, but it's already taken, so allocate their next highest, item 6 (79), to agent 6.
8. Agent 7 values item 7 highest, but it's already taken, so allocate their next highest, item 8 (73), to agent 7.

Now we have allocated 8 items. We need to ensure a total of 9 items are allocated. Let's find the least valued item that is not yet allocated and give it to an agent with the lowest overall allocation satisfaction:

- Item 3 is unallocated, with a somewhat lower allocation satisfaction for many agents. Let's give item 3 to agent 3, whose next highest value after their allocated item is 44 for item 3.

Now we have a total of 9 items allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6],
    "7": []
}
```
