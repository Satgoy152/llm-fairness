Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  97  23  58  63  97  30   1  12
1  97  22  49  42  20   8  53   7  80
2  26  93  75  77  86  88  61  69   7
3  41  39  86  97  61   2  81  53   7
4  23  23  85  92  32  44  30  85  13
5  93  74  35  17  50  63   6  70  76
6  22  73  40  66  73  89   1  44  71
7  55  97  90  62  36  37  39  44  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. However, since we have 8 agents and only 9 items, one of the agents will receive only one item. Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Allocate items with the highest values for Agent 0.
2. Agent 1: Allocate items with the highest values for Agent 1.
3. Continue this process for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and maximizing total value.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 3 highly, but since it's already taken, we allocate item 7 as the next best.
- Agent 5 values item 0 highly, but since it's already taken, we allocate item 8 as the next best.
- Agent 6 values item 5 highly, but since it's already taken, we allocate item 4 as the next best.
- Agent 7 values item 1 highly, but since it's already taken, we allocate item 2 as the next best.

This leaves us with one remaining item, item 6, which can be allocated to Agent 0 since they have high value for it and only one item so far.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
