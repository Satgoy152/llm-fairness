Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  64  33  54  97   1  53  64  77
1  61   8  63  10   0   7  65  95  30
2  77  62  98  89  86  43  58  34  64
3  27  40  81  23  46  78  17  22  86
4  36  86  76  37  75  69  54  96  41
5  39  45  89  68  41  77  57  68  99
6  57  30  88  17  30  46  21  46  72
7  53  91  40  11  64  76  87  94  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one.

To achieve this, we can evaluate the values and make allocations that aim to distribute high-value items among different agents. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 4 (value 97)
2. Agent 1 receives item 7 (value 95)
3. Agent 2 receives item 2 (value 98)
4. Agent 3 receives item 8 (value 86)
5. Agent 4 receives item 1 (value 86)
6. Agent 5 receives item 5 (value 77)
7. Agent 6 receives item 0 (value 57)
8. Agent 7 receives items 3 and 6 (values 11 and 87, respectively)

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and it distributes the items to maximize the total value each agent receives, given the constraints.
