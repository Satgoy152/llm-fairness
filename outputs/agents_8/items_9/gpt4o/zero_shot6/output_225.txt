Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  36  94  34   6   4   9  67   1
1  18  54  82  66  39  95  66  65  80
2  55  15  48  79  15  94  92  73  36
3  91   5  51  34  82  89   7  41  41
4  51  94  60  74  50  59  32  88  54
5  33  63  99  34  68  54  77  96  63
6   7  84  10  70  82  95  25  61  22
7  26  87  82  64  99  65  23  76  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent one item based on their highest valuation.
2. Assign the remaining item based on the next highest valuation among the unallocated items.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (Value 94)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (Value 95)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (Value 92)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (Value 91)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (Value 94)
- Agent 5: Item 8 (Value 63)
- Agent 6: Item 4 (Value 82)
- Agent 7: Item 7 (Value 76)

Now, one item is left unallocated (Item 3). We can assign it to the agent who has the highest valuation for it among those who have only one item. Agent 2 has a second-highest valuation for Item 3 (value 79), so we will allocate it to them.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [7]
}
```
