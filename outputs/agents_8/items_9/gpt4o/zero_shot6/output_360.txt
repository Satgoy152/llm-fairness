Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  40  36  83  82  85  18  66  32
1  22   7  12  19  66   4  80  92  74
2  51  35  55  15  65   2  54  70  54
3  22  72  80  61  23   0  45  90  18
4  84  42  61  52  40  23  19  59  75
5  57  93  20  39  24  40  20  31  77
6   1  46  13  74   8  74  61  68  98
7  95  31  60  71  84  55  46   0  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 8 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Considering the matrix provided:

1. Start by identifying agents with very high valuations for certain items to ensure those items are allocated to those agents first.
2. Continue allocating items by considering the next highest valuation for remaining items and agents.
3. Ensure every agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0, so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 7, so allocate item 7 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 8, so allocate item 8 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3, so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 4, so allocate item 4 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to agent 5.
- Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 6, so allocate item 6 to agent 6.
- Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 5, so allocate item 5 to agent 7.

This leaves us with item 2, which has the highest remaining value for agent 7. Therefore, allocate item 2 to agent 7.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
