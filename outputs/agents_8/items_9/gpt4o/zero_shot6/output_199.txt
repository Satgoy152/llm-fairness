Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  22   7  24  81  46  75  64  28
1   9  55  40  97  76   3  91  34  29
2  27  15  12  97  44   5  93  38  44
3  72  46  59  25  92  37  19  76  64
4   6  28  48  78  75  74  82  85  83
5  32  84  99  13  41  80   1  38  74
6   2  24  43  15  25  78  14  91  20
7  75  79   2  71   4  83  47  97   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is a possible allocation using this strategy:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 (value 72)
2. Item 1: Agent 5 (value 84)
3. Item 2: Agent 5 (value 99)
4. Item 3: Agent 1 (value 97)
5. Item 4: Agent 0 (value 81)
6. Item 5: Agent 7 (value 83)
7. Item 6: Agent 2 (value 93)
8. Item 7: Agent 7 (value 97)
9. Item 8: Agent 4 (value 83)

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1, 2],
    "6": [],
    "7": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, maximizing their individual valuations as much as possible.
