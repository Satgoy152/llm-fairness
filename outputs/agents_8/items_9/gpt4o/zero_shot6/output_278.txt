Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  89  61  26  42   4  74  44  11
1  36  11  79  12  88  79  87  31  48
2  27  60  13  42  75  61  94  66  15
3  39  27   9  91  75  38  60  44  25
4  66   7  83  98  68  81  42  41  89
5  10  45  51  48  43   2  67  81  43
6  70  76  17  41  58  49  91  15   4
7  51  17  49  70  15  99  19  31  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that all 9 items are allocated. We'll try to allocate items based on the highest valuation an agent has for a given item, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Let's start by assigning the highest valued item to each agent:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 1 (89).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 4 (88).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 6 (94).
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3 (91).
5. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 3 (98), but since item 3 is already taken, we give them item 2 (83).
6. Agent 5 has the highest value for item 7 (81).
7. Agent 6 has the highest value for item 6 (91), but since item 6 is already taken, we give them item 1 (76).
8. Agent 7 has the highest value for item 5 (99).

Now, let's look at what items are remaining and allocate them to agents who have not already received one:

- Items left: 0, 8

Let's allocate these remaining items to agents who have the next highest valuation for them:

- Item 0: Agent 6 has a high value (70), so we allocate item 0 to agent 6.
- Item 8: Agent 4 has a high value (89), so we allocate item 8 to agent 4.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 8],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.
