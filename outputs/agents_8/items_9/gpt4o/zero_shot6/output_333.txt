Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  23  67  80  47  81  71  73  93
1  41  40  33  17  33  53  46  69   3
2  58  28  60  10  83  45  14   4  30
3  43  52  87  29  64   1  29  54  80
4  78  83  40  68  76  15   5  99  99
5  36  48  67  23  95  89  78  59  44
6  88  42  57  87  51  31  50  13  60
7  88  56  75  84  36  30  12  71  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 8 agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets an approximately equal share of their highest valued items. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items, while the rest will receive one item each. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value items: 8, 5, 3.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value item: 5.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value item: 4.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value item: 2.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value item: 7.
6. **Agent 5:** Highest value item: 4 (but taken), next is 5 (also taken), then 6.
7. **Agent 6:** Highest value item: 0.
8. **Agent 7:** Highest value item: 0 (but taken), next is 3.

Now let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 8
- **Agent 1**: Item 5
- **Agent 2**: Item 4
- **Agent 3**: Item 2
- **Agent 4**: Item 7
- **Agent 5**: Item 6
- **Agent 6**: Item 0
- **Agent 7**: Item 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [3]
}
```
