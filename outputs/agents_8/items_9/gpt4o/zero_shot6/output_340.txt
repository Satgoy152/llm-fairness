Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  84  92  79  76  88  99  49  80
1  47  72  25  77  71  88  22  76  98
2  76  64  36  30  96  57   7  92  82
3   7  61  68  30  18  44  92  47  22
4   6  56  84  95  21  45  99   9  66
5  82  73  74  68  67  91  92  97  54
6  39  20  51  32  26  84  24  79  35
7  51  34  55  79   1  92  90   6  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items so each agent gets approximately the same number of items, and we can try to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. In this case, we have 9 items and 8 agents, which means most agents can receive one item and one agent will receive two items.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item or none if it's not possible to make a fair allocation.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 99).
2. Agent 1 gets item 8 (value 98).
3. Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 96).
4. Agent 3 gets item 2 (value 68).
5. Agent 4 gets item 3 (value 95).
6. Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 91).
7. Agent 6 gets item 1 (value 20).
8. Agent 7 gets items 0 and 7 (values 51 and 6).

Now, presenting this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [0, 7]
}
```
