Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  90   4  63  89   7  14  92  46
1  70  96  94  86  95  53  84  86  23
2   0  67  52  69  62  70  75  78  29
3  35  50  20  46  49  43  95  24  87
4  97  79  92  97  65  67  71  40  24
5  48  46  55  50  42  38  75  70  79
6  38  65  39  21   3  35  54  40  44
7  70  85   2  32  32  47  54  31  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the total value of the items as evenly as possible among the agents. Given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive more than one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value of each item for each agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent gets more than one item initially unless necessary.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the highest at 97.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 96.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 94.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the highest at 97.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 95.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the highest at 70.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the highest at 95.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the highest at 92.
- Item 8: Agent 3 values it the highest at 87.

Now let's adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets an item, keeping fairness in mind:

- Agent 0: Already has item 7.
- Agent 1: Already has items 1, 2, and 4. To ensure fairness, remove item 2.
- Agent 2: Already has item 5.
- Agent 3: Already has item 6.
- Agent 4: Already has items 0 and 3. To ensure fairness, remove item 0.
- Agent 5: Assign item 0 (Agent 4 no longer has it).
- Agent 6: Assign item 2 (Agent 1 no longer has it).
- Agent 7: Assign item 8 (Agent 3 no longer has it).

Let's ensure each item is now assigned to only one agent and every agent has at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are assigned, and each agent receives at least one item, with the total number of allocated items being 9.
