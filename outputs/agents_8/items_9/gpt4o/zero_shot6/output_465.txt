Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  89   1  44  74  67  69  97  28
1  65  29  12  55  15  81  54  88  90
2  30   4   3  57  61  80  36  98  27
3  33  84  35  91  67   2  62  72  60
4  30  18  53  46  40  66  94  28  82
5  34  72  39  71  48  44  38  60   8
6  22  97  44  69  10  91  73   1   8
7  57  11  49  88  27  89   0  64  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and only 9 items in total are allocated. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, making sure each agent gets at least one item.
2. If there are conflicts (i.e., more than one agent values an item equally), choose the agent with the least total assigned value so far to receive the item.
3. Ensure the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (42).
- Item 1: Agent 6 values it the most (97).
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most (53).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (91).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (74).
- Item 5: Agent 6 values it the most (91).
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most (94).
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (98).
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it the most (90).

Now, let's ensure that every agent has at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. Adjust accordingly if conflicts arise.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [1, 5],
    "7": []
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 is allocated items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 is allocated item 8.
- Agent 2 is allocated item 7.
- Agent 3 is allocated item 3.
- Agent 4 is allocated items 2 and 6.
- Agent 5 is allocated no items.
- Agent 6 is allocated items 1 and 5.
- Agent 7 is allocated no items.

This ensures that all 9 items are allocated and every agent gets a fair chance based on their valuations.
