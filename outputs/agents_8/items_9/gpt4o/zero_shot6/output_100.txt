Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  74  95  62   2  86  63  38  40
1  99  24  26  81  89  65  50  39  77
2   1  36  79   8  98  46  16  10  97
3  89  16  51  17  97  23  84  22  50
4  48  73  11  22  85  68  78  73  69
5  10  75  25  33  40  27  47  31  71
6  88  39   0  72  66  49  99  30  57
7  49  94  34  34  18  48  72  87  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed, we need to consider the agents' valuations for the items. Here is a potential allocation strategy based on maximizing individual valuations for fairness:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 99)
2. Assign item 1 to agent 7 (value 94)
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 95)
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 81)
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2 (value 98)
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 86)
7. Assign item 6 to agent 6 (value 99)
8. Assign item 7 to agent 7 (value 87)
9. Assign item 8 to agent 2 (value 97)

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, promoting individual satisfaction while maintaining fairness.

Here is the allocation presented in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [1, 7]
}
```
