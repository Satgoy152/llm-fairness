Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  52  24  70   1  43   8  13  89
1  50  20  35   2  47  51   0  54  10
2  90  16  34  38  22  97  65   4  84
3  95  61  53  64  10  94  85  51  59
4  99  86  35  33  45  47  47  97  98
5  99  48  10  14  93  11  32  82  22
6  39   7  26  23   5  43  93  34  55
7  53  65  97  55  56  82  37  92  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly. However, since there are 9 items and 8 agents, some agents may receive more than one item, while others may receive none.

To achieve a fair allocation, we can use a strategy where we try to maximize each agent's total value by assigning items they value the most, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0: Items [0, 3] - Total value = 73 + 70 = 143
2. Agent 1: Item [5] - Total value = 51
3. Agent 2: Item [7] - Total value = 4
4. Agent 3: Item [6] - Total value = 85
5. Agent 4: Item [8] - Total value = 98
6. Agent 5: Item [4] - Total value = 93
7. Agent 6: Item [2] - Total value = 26
8. Agent 7: Item [1] - Total value = 65

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the agent's valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [1]
}
```
