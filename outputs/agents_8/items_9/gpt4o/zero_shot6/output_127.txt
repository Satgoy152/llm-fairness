Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87   4  61   2  80  16  13  26  66
1  71  11  71  26  73  68   7   2  27
2  51  74   2  35  91  91  21  27  15
3  94  94   9  23  99  29  41  69  73
4  98  70  53  29  56  86  70  78  99
5  77  31  47  71  35  15  53  29  87
6  95  24  46  53  60  26  49  15  60
7  22  15  44   4  47  36  88  90  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their valuations. We have 8 agents and 9 items, which means at least one agent will receive more than one item.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.
3. Adjust allocations so that exactly 9 items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most (98).
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most (94).
- Item 2: Agent 0 and 1 both value it highly, but agent 0 values its other items lower, so assign to agent 0 (61).
- Item 3: Agent 5 values it the most (71).
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (99).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (91).
- Item 6: Agent 7 values it the most (88).
- Item 7: Agent 7 values it the most (90).
- Item 8: Agent 4 values it the most (99).

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [0, 8],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [],
    "7": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are assigned while maximizing the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.
