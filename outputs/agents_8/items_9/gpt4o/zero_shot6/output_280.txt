Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  63  60  87  86  62  42  38  23
1  22  20  94  58  18  66  24  95  75
2  61   0  60  56  84  86  11  41  64
3  95   4  66  60  53  31  86  76  78
4  28  38  89  94  82   9  88  90  73
5  76   9  50  97  96  91  46  94  85
6  38   2  56  44  85  23   3  82  60
7  61  66  82  93  33  67   1  29   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 8 agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are more agents than items, some agents may receive no items. Let's try to allocate the items to maximize the total valuation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 highly.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 highly.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 highly.
7. Agent 6 values item 8 highly.
8. Agent 7 values item 2 highly.

By choosing these high valuations, we can ensure each item goes to an agent who values it highly:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 6.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 7.

Now we have assigned 8 items. We need to assign one more item. Let's assign item 1 based on remaining high valuations:

- Agent 7 has the next highest valuation for item 1.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [2, 1]
}
```
