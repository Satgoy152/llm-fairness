Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  30  28  65  17  68  82  55  76
1  32  23  22  55  88  85  10  99  95
2  24  19  25  48  91  24  45  80  11
3  70  74  33   6  25  74  82  65  46
4  77  69  33  55  65  64  29  44  60
5   7  73  90  57  50  69  66   3   3
6  88  20  62  95  33   4  14  84  82
7  84   4  14  70  85  89  93  27  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent gets, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item. Given that there are 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will get 2 items while the others get 1.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign the most valued item to each agent.
2. Allocate the remaining item to the agent who values it the most but hasn't received their top choice yet.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (value: 82).
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (value: 99).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (value: 91).
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (value: 74).
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (value: 77).
6. Agent 5 values item 2 the highest (value: 90).
7. Agent 6 values item 3 the highest (value: 95).
8. Agent 7 values item 5 the highest (value: 89).

Now, each agent has received one item. We have one item left (item 8), which should be given to the agent who values it the most and would benefit significantly from an extra item. Agent 1 values item 8 the highest (value: 95), so we allocate it to them.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [5]
}
```
