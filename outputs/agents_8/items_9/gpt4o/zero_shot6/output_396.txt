Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  68  71  19  65   2   3  84  60
1  59  43  26  61  69  68  45  88  42
2  12  67  28  80   7  53   8  91  96
3  50   8  29   4  77  24  35  12  42
4   4  21   3  36  21   7  48   9  86
5  56  15   2  35  80  93  24  60  84
6  22  63  12  39  27  63  68  20  37
7  35  53  81  87  88  67  76  20  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items based on their valuations, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Given that there are 8 agents and 9 items, each agent should ideally receive at least one item, and one agent will receive a second item. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent one item based on their highest valuation that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Assign the remaining item to the agent who values it highest among those who received the least valuable item in the first round.

Following this strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest with 84.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the highest, but it's already taken, so item 3 with 61.
- Agent 2 values item 8 the highest with 96.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest with 77.
- Agent 4 values item 8 the highest, but it's taken, so item 4 with 21.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the highest with 93.
- Agent 6 values item 6 the highest with 68.
- Agent 7 values item 4 the highest, but it's taken, so item 3 with 87.

After the first round, the items allocated are 7, 3, 8, 4, 5, 6, and 3. We need to reassign the items to ensure each agent gets one, considering some items were doubly allocated due to conflicts.

Reassign the remaining items:

- Agent 0: [0] (highest remaining value of 78 for item 0)
- Agent 1: [1] (next highest remaining value of 69 for item 4)
- Agent 2: [2] (next highest remaining value of 67 for item 1)
- Agent 3: [3] (already assigned 4)
- Agent 4: [5] (next highest remaining value of 86 for item 8)
- Agent 5: [5] (already assigned)
- Agent 6: [6] (already assigned)
- Agent 7: [7] (already assigned)

Now thereâ€™s one item left, item 2, which needs to be assigned to one of the agents with the least overall allocation. Let's allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation for it among those with less valuable items:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2] (additional item with value 26)

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
