Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  89  42  95  44  96  57  89  60
1  61   6  78   3   6  11  73  43  32
2  58  56  48  23  99  42  55  30  57
3  55  75  66  93  51  46   5  39  96
4   2  45  21  52  50  35  38  73  55
5  30  67  42  76  56  41  15  69   3
6  99  27  78  43  41  78  84  40  32
7  37  84   0  53  61  57  92  18  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 8 agents and 9 items, one of the agents will get 2 items while the rest will get 1 item each. We will try to allocate items based on the highest valuation by each agent to ensure fairness. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 5.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 4.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 7.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 1.
7. Agent 6 highly values item 0.
8. Agent 7 highly values item 6.

Since agent 3 values item 8 highly as well, and they only have one item, we can allocate item 8 to them too.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [6]
}
```
