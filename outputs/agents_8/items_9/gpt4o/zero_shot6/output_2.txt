Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  85  17  56  83  56  23  32  51
1  75  56  44  50  77  77  21  65  66
2  48  53  48  91  48  75  34  40   1
3  68  42  69  32  68   6  69  51  80
4  49  73  95  94  67  76  23  77  18
5  32  74   2  75  94  36   8  23  37
6  27  99  16  26  36  82  14   6  12
7  68  93  23  63  65  38  93  31  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value that each agent receives. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If multiple agents value an item equally, select the agent with the least total value at that point.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, or redistribute to ensure a fair allocation if some agents have no items.

Let's go through the allocation process based on the table provided:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 75, which is the highest.
- **Item 1**: Agent 6 values it at 99, which is the highest.
- **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it at 95, which is the highest.
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it at 91, which is the highest.
- **Item 4**: Agent 5 values it at 94, which is the highest.
- **Item 5**: Agent 6 values it at 82, which is the highest.
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it at 69, which is the highest.
- **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it at 77, which is the highest.
- **Item 8**: Agent 3 values it at 80, which is the highest.

Now let's ensure that all agents are included in the allocation, and each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0: No items allocated, but we must include them in the result.
- Agent 1: Item [0].
- Agent 2: Item [3].
- Agent 3: Items [6, 8].
- Agent 4: Items [2, 7].
- Agent 5: Item [4].
- Agent 6: Items [1, 5].
- Agent 7: No items allocated, but we must include them in the result.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [2, 7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1, 5],
    "7": []
}
```
