Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  60  94   6  80  39  84  65  57
1  46  47  10  97  14  68   9  54  62
2  55  15  51  42  46  80  42  78   6
3   4  20  88  89  48  27  50  93  50
4  68  57  43  26  11   0  10  79  59
5  96  36  53  47  75  21  78  54  20
6  57  61   7  56  14  94  43  53  27
7  74  42  50  45  83  75  76  23  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the items according to their preferences. While there are different strategies to achieve fairness (like maximizing total valuation, ensuring envy-freeness, etc.), a simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's how the allocation could be done:

1. For each item, find the agent who values it the highest.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Let's go through the items one by one:

- **Item 0**: The highest value is 96 by Agent 5.
- **Item 1**: The highest value is 60 by Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: The highest value is 94 by Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: The highest value is 97 by Agent 1.
- **Item 4**: The highest value is 83 by Agent 7.
- **Item 5**: The highest value is 94 by Agent 6.
- **Item 6**: The highest value is 84 by Agent 0.
- **Item 7**: The highest value is 93 by Agent 3.
- **Item 8**: The highest value is 76 by Agent 7.

With this allocation strategy, below is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [4, 8]
}
```

Here, each item is assigned to the agent that values it the highest, ensuring all 9 items are allocated. Note that some agents may not receive any items if they do not have the highest valuation for any item.
