Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  12  38  34  57  93  21  15  63
1  69   0  54  56  76  93  32  89  96
2  75  64  20  31  72  24  36  76  38
3  82  19  88  93  55  95  98  16  16
4  70  82  49  96  62   4  42  42  33
5  27  18  98  31  56  20  96  13  38
6  25  83  23  86  68  24  95  97  89
7  58   8  20  81  88  83  47  81  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on the given valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. We will aim to achieve a balanced allocation by considering the valuations provided by each agent for each item.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (highest value for agent 0).
2. Assign item 8 to agent 1 (highest value for agent 1).
3. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (second-highest value for agent 2).
4. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (highest value for agent 3).
5. Assign item 7 to agent 4 (highest value for agent 4).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 5 (highest value for agent 5).
7. Assign item 1 to agent 6 (highest value for agent 6).
8. Assign item 4 to agent 7 (highest value for agent 7).
9. Assign item 0 to agent 3 (second-highest value for agent 3).

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item and all 9 items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [4]
}
```
