Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22   8  78   2  70   2  82   0  33
1   9  67  92  85  84  24   9  41  84
2  75  53  71  30  38  70  65  24  73
3  86   5  45  47  15  74  11   2  61
4  14  42  73  16  36  22  41  12  19
5  94  16  24  61  80  49  76  39  80
6  67  33  78  24  60  65  19  30  66
7  84  97  29  44  68  14  87  45  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations, one approach is to allocate items to the agents that value them the most, while keeping track of the total items allocated.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (92).
2. Agent 7 values item 1 the highest (97).
3. Agent 5 values item 0 the highest (94).
4. Agent 7 values item 8 the second highest (93).
5. Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (82).
6. Agent 5 values item 4 the second highest (80).
7. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (70).
8. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (47).
9. Agent 6 values item 7 the highest (30).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item or caters to their highest valuation, ensuring a fair distribution based on the provided valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 4],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [1, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with no agent receiving more than they can potentially value highly based on the table.
