Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  61  23  33  65  32  38  37  18
1  54  34  38  43  30   6  54   2  85
2  52  66  52  37  86  60  52  19  80
3  85  95  34  24  69  72  30  21  16
4  76  63  61  95  82  45  54  72  79
5  23  85  85  29  18  85  36  41  73
6  91   4  10  76  16  84  19  63  30
7  79  34   1  52   2  96  29  45  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. We can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive.

Let's go through the valuations and determine a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 0 (91).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 8 (85).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 4 (86).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 1 (95).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 3 (95).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest valuation for item 2 (85).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest valuation for item 0 (91), but it's already taken. Next highest for item 5 (84).
8. **Agent 7**: Highest valuation for item 5 (96), but it's already taken by Agent 6. Next highest for item 7 (45).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to ensure all items are distributed:

- Item 6 is left. Agent 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7 have not been allocated a second item, and Agent 6 has only one because item 0 was taken. Let's look at the remaining item's valuation:
  - Agent 0: 38
  - Agent 1: 54
  - Agent 2: 52
  - Agent 3: 30
  - Agent 4: 54
  - Agent 5: 36
  - Agent 7: 29

Agent 1 and Agent 4 have the highest valuation for item 6 (54).

Let's assign item 6 to Agent 1 since Agent 4 already has a high-value item.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [8, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [7]
}
```
