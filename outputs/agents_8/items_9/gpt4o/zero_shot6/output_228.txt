Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  66   8  26  21  71  82  21  90
1   2  16  60  43   7  78  62  34  69
2  94  37  86  13  35  55  43  71  18
3  64  25  27  74  41  24  71  31  80
4   7  55  67   6  31   7  39  89  50
5  19  30  96  46   1   6  29  60  87
6  41  51  34  57  84  17  73  85  77
7  81  86   6  95  79   2  11  34  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their valuations. Since there are only 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will likely receive two items while the others receive one item each.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by agent 2 (94)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by agent 7 (86)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by agent 5 (96)
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by agent 7 (95)
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by agent 6 (84)
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by agent 1 (78)
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (82)
8. **Item 7**: Highest valuation by agent 4 (89)
9. **Item 8**: Highest valuation by agent 0 (90)

Since agent 0 has the two highest valuations for items 6 and 8, agent 0 will receive two items. The rest of the items are allocated to different agents based on their highest valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents in a manner that reflects their highest valuations for those items.
