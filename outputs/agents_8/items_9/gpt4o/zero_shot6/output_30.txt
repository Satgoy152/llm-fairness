Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  39  79  59  60  57  66  58   6
1  52  19  54  19  26  87  58  16  43
2  83  67  70  64   9   6  77  90   3
3   9  66  86  47  35  64  96  82  13
4  96  29  27  93  54  52  64   3  57
5  58  62  67  86  68  11   5  20  78
6  85  93   6  62  26  99  24  86  44
7  27  33  81  56  91   2  69   5  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value across all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the rest will receive 1 or 0 items. Let's try to distribute the items to maximize each agent's total value.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 prefers item 2 (79).
- Agent 1 prefers item 5 (87).
- Agent 2 prefers item 7 (90).
- Agent 3 prefers item 6 (96).
- Agent 4 prefers item 0 (96).
- Agent 5 prefers item 8 (78).
- Agent 6 prefers item 1 (93).
- Agent 7 prefers item 4 (91).

Since each agent has received their highest value item and there are only 8 unique items allocated, let's assign the unallocated item 3 to a second agent. Agent 5 (as they have a high total valuation from item 8) can also take item 3, which they value at 86, to balance the distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [8, 3],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an item they value highly and fairly distributes the items among the agents.
