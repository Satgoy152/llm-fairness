Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  95  72  90   9  46  34  90   8
1  45  88  89  50  24  23  18  19  62
2   1  34   6  48  19  12  44  84  82
3  46  12  38  20  43   3  61  49  24
4   9  31  51  42  10  61  13  18   1
5  32  29  87  40   9  66   2  63  51
6  50  76  79  46  93  98  81  55  43
7  43  47  84   3  91  13  14  74  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider assigning items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction, taking into account the valuations provided by each agent. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, a straightforward approach is to start by giving each agent at least one item based on their highest valuation and then distribute the remaining items to optimize fairness.

Let's go through this process:

1. Assign each agent their most valued item:
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (95)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (89)
   - Agent 2: Item 7 (84)
   - Agent 3: Item 6 (61)
   - Agent 4: Item 5 (61)
   - Agent 5: Item 5 (66) [Note: Agent 4 and 5 both have high valuations for Item 5]
   - Agent 6: Item 5 (98) [Note: Item 5 is highly valued by multiple agents]
   - Agent 7: Item 4 (91)

2. After initial allocation, we have assigned items to all agents, but there are more items to distribute. We need to ensure each agent's allocation does not include duplicate items and that all 9 items are allocated.

3. Adjust the allocation to meet the following conditions:
   - Ensure no item is assigned to more than one agent.
   - Ensure a fair distribution considering the next highest available valuations.

Here's a revised allocation that meets these conditions:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (90)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (50)
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 2 (82)
- Reassign Item 6 to Agent 3 (61)
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 4 (61)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 5 (87)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 6 (55)
- Reassign Item 4 to Agent 7 (91)

This ensures each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated without duplication.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [4]
}
```
