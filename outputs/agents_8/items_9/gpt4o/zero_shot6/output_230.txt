Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83   8  43  64  15  88  63  71  62
1  35  33  82  95  42  11  24  12  19
2  80  41  88  46  67  65   3   6   1
3  93  87  67  90  42  27  88  30  80
4  86  53  94  47  59  79  58  45  32
5  75  97   2  88  71  36  23  14  50
6  56   9  72  14  61  33  10  80  71
7  91  64  79  93  15  63  72  58  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We will aim to distribute the items so that each agent has approximately equal total valuation, considering the constraints.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. First, allocate items with the highest valuations ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Then, allocate remaining items to balance the total valuation.

Based on the table provided, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Values are [83, 8, 43, 64, 15, 88, 63, 71, 62]
- Agent 1: Values are [35, 33, 82, 95, 42, 11, 24, 12, 19]
- Agent 2: Values are [80, 41, 88, 46, 67, 65, 3, 6, 1]
- Agent 3: Values are [93, 87, 67, 90, 42, 27, 88, 30, 80]
- Agent 4: Values are [86, 53, 94, 47, 59, 79, 58, 45, 32]
- Agent 5: Values are [75, 97, 2, 88, 71, 36, 23, 14, 50]
- Agent 6: Values are [56, 9, 72, 14, 61, 33, 10, 80, 71]
- Agent 7: Values are [91, 64, 79, 93, 15, 63, 72, 58, 55]

Using this information, the allocation can be as follows:

1. Agent 0 gets item 5 (Value 88)
2. Agent 1 gets item 3 (Value 95)
3. Agent 2 gets item 2 (Value 88)
4. Agent 3 gets item 0 (Value 93)
5. Agent 4 gets item 4 (Value 59)
6. Agent 5 gets item 1 (Value 97)
7. Agent 6 gets item 7 (Value 80)
8. Agent 7 gets item 6 (Value 72)
9. Allocate the last item to balance valuations, Agent 3 gets item 8 (Value 80)

This allocation provides a fairly even distribution based on the highest valuations per agent and ensures each agent gets at least one item. Here's the final JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [6]
}
```
