Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  35  30  43   9  53  49  54   8
1  94  20  63  79  82  44  68  92  72
2  10  25  45  10  37  88  36  88  64
3  91  13  30  77  47  72  80  91  73
4  38  34  48  66  77  22   3  62  73
5  38  68  57  76  92  13  70  14  58
6   5  60  63  50  72  99  68  13  43
7  41  69   7  84  70  43  74  29  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value of the items received by each agent is as balanced as possible. However, since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one item each.

Let's analyze the values and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 7 (value 54).
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 0 (value 94).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 5 (value 88).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 0 (value 91). However, since item 0 is already chosen, the next highest is item 7 (value 91), but taken by Agent 0. Then, item 6 (value 80).

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 4 (value 77).

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 4 (value 92), but taken by Agent 4. Next highest is item 3 (value 76).

7. **Agent 6**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 5 (value 99), but taken by Agent 2. Next highest is item 4 (value 72), but taken by Agent 4. Then item 1 (value 60).

8. **Agent 7**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 8 (value 89).

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 3** (who received only one item): Allocate item 3 (next highest value item 77).

With this distribution, each agent receives items based on their highest values, and the total allocation counts up to 9.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [8]
}
```
