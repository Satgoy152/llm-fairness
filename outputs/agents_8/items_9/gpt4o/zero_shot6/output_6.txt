Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97   6  89  34   2  49  90  56  37
1   3  26  41  37  47  66  63  17  88
2  55  27  41  74  35  23   0   2  65
3  58  87  61  85  88  77  30  17  73
4  19  14  26  34  71  20  55  15  49
5   5  53  51  84  24  87  98  36  54
6  70  49  54  97  32  79  54  81  24
7  41  88  66  98  89  96  18  27  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. There are 9 items and 8 agents, so one agent will get 2 items, and the rest will get 1 item each.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to agent 7.
3. Agent 0 also has a high valuation for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.
4. Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 3, so we allocate item 3 to agent 7.
5. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4, so we allocate item 4 to agent 3.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to agent 5.
7. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 6, so we allocate item 6 to agent 5.
8. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 7, so we allocate item 7 to agent 6.
9. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 8, so we allocate item 8 to agent 1.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5, 6],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
