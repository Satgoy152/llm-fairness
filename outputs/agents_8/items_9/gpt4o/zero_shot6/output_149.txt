Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  79  66  20  79  18  71  51  40
1  64  43  63  14  69  87  78   8  30
2  81  66  62  43  62  48  16  17   5
3  25  36  97  90  39  85  12  58  93
4  36  64  37  32  33  98  45  20  91
5   3  77  64  70  74  72  52  26  95
6  63  68  58  29  36  51  56  16  87
7  49  38  65  55  66  75  95  71  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations for allocated items) while ensuring each agent receives at least one item or no items at all. Here's a possible allocation strategy based on the valuations provided:

1. Assign items to agents with the highest valuations for those items.
2. Ensure every item is allocated, and the total number of allocated items equals 9.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (81).
- Item 1: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (79).
- Item 2: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (97).
- Item 3: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (90).
- Item 4: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (79).
- Item 5: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (98).
- Item 6: Agent 7 has the highest valuation (95).
- Item 7: Agent 7 has the highest valuation (71).
- Item 8: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (95).

This allocation uses all 9 items, and each item is allocated based on the highest valuation. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [],
    "7": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents based on their highest valuations, with some agents potentially receiving more items if they have higher valuations for more items.
