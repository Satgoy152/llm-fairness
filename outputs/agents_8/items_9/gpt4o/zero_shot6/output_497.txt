Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  69  80  81  23  76  61  79  30
1  10  24  90  27  40  61  36   8  89
2  86  49   5  57  62  18  72  44  35
3  27  44  29  64  69  70  47  53  19
4  45  41  73   6   2  78  91  40  45
5  95  73  46  28  84  79   9  74   9
6  35  18  54  23  50   5  75  13   6
7  44  56  79  97  85  58  98   1  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can use a simple greedy approach. We will prioritize assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations for the items. 

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 5 values it the highest at 95.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 5 values it the highest at 73.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 90.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 7 values it the highest at 97.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 7 values it the highest at 85.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 values it the highest at 78.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 7 values it the highest at 98.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 79.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 89.

After this allocation, we ensure that each item is assigned, and the distribution is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0, 1],
    "6": [],
    "7": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuation for each item and ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
