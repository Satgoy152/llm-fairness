Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  14  80  83  45  56  53  28   0
1  99  43  59   6  46  19   5   3  26
2  95  62  61  66  38  99  50  70  23
3  88  80  40  75   8  48  88  47  62
4  49  24  10  45  22  57   8  53  94
5  52  92  86  72  68  40  58  16  62
6  69  51  73  48  32  16  35   6  75
7  82  49  63  91  72  99  73  95  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Find the highest-valued items for each agent and start assigning based on maximizing the total value received by each agent.
2. Ensure that no item is assigned more than once, and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's go through a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly, but since it's already allocated, let's assign item 1.
- Agent 4 has no standout high values, but item 8 is relatively high compared to the rest.
- Agent 5 values item 2 highly, but since it's already allocated, let's assign item 1.
- Agent 6 has a moderate value for item 8, but since it's already allocated, let's assign item 6.
- Agent 7 values item 5 highly, but since it's already allocated, let's assign item 7.

After this process, let's ensure every item is allocated:

- Item 0: Assigned to Agent 1
- Item 1: Assigned to Agent 5
- Item 2: Assigned to Agent 0
- Item 3: Assigned to Agent 0
- Item 4: Assigned to Agent 7
- Item 5: Assigned to Agent 2
- Item 6: Assigned to Agent 6
- Item 7: Assigned to Agent 7
- Item 8: Assigned to Agent 4

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each of the 9 items is allocated to one of the 8 agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items, and attempts to maximize the overall valuation for each agent.
