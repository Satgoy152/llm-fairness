Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  99  99  71  22  65  95  71  35
1  36  36  34  84  47  30  44  17  52
2   4   5  35  66  55  67  26  30  75
3  46  20  94  50  58  78  65  11  15
4  22   2  77  55  74  74  18  23  17
5   2   9  55  24  84  37  75  18  66
6  17  91  39  87  16   6  18  45  44
7  31  10  55  58  79  24  63  27  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent gets approximately the same total value from their allocated items. However, since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the sum of values for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We'll start by finding the highest value for each agent and distribute the items accordingly.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 1 (Value: 99)
2. Agent 1: Item 3 (Value: 84)
3. Agent 2: Item 8 (Value: 75)
4. Agent 3: Item 2 (Value: 94)
5. Agent 4: Item 4 (Value: 74)
6. Agent 5: Item 6 (Value: 75)
7. Agent 6: Item 0 (Value: 52)
8. Agent 7: Item 7 (Value: 27)

Now, we have 8 items allocated. We need to allocate one additional item to one of the agents. We'll choose the agent who has a relatively lower total value from their initial allocation to ensure fairness. Agent 7, who has the lowest value item (27), will receive an additional item.

9. Agent 7: Item 5 (Value: 24)

Now, the allocations are complete. Here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.
