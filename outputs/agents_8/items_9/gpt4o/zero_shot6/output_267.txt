Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  47  44  20  91  15  69  98   4
1   9   5  51  65  20  25  83  68  63
2  94  77  24  70  66  98  35  51  85
3  66  38  89  82  82  36  66  25  22
4  55  53  21  33  27  83  52  70  95
5  82  11  88  88  67  57  17  97  76
6  76  71  66  65  35  39  68  13  19
7  88  82  46  61  31  72  65  78   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives an integer number of items. We have 9 items and 8 agents, so one agent will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent one item based on their highest valuation that hasn't been assigned to another agent yet.
2. Since one agent needs to receive an additional item, assign the remaining item to the agent who has the second-highest valuation for an unassigned item.

Let's perform the allocations:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 7 (98).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 6 (83).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (98).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2 (89).
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 8 (95).
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 3 (88).
7. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 1 (71).
8. Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 0 (88).

Now, one item is left unallocated. We will use the second-highest valuation among the unallocated items:

- Remaining item: 4
  - Agent 0 values it at 91.
  - Agent 1 values it at 20.
  - Agent 2 values it at 66.
  - Agent 3 values it at 82.
  - Agent 4 values it at 27.
  - Agent 5 values it at 67.
  - Agent 6 values it at 35.
  - Agent 7 values it at 31.

Agent 0 has the highest valuation for the remaining item 4 (91).

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 9 items allocated.
