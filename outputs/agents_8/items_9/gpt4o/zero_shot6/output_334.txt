Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  79  86  52  12  99  77  67  99
1  65  56   4  48   9  73  66  77  71
2  22  22  80  67  36  84  30  72  25
3  15   7   8   6  76  66  68  96   0
4  60   8  71  21  64  23  47  46  82
5  80  54   2  16  90   9  60  26  64
6  25  10  12  99  45  90  81  67  55
7  96  89  68  24  60  58  19  39  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated without any left over.

Here's a potential allocation based on maximizing total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (99) and item 8 (99).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 7 (77).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (80).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4 (76).
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 1 (8).
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 0 (80).
- Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 3 (99).
- Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 6 (19).

Based on this, the allocations can be made as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items where they have relatively high valuations, and all 9 items are allocated to the agents. Each agent gets at least one item, and no items are left unallocated.
