Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  93  71   9  91  37  19  72   4
1  94  74  55  93   1  12  98  59  97
2  40  64  52   9  16   0  11  78  90
3   2  53  52  91  94  19  29  34  21
4  60  36  91  93  96  58  35  12  41
5  24  21   7  74  27  39  80  19  31
6  62  79  32  67  38  58  24  79  10
7  54  28  87  35  96  41  77  64  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, I will aim to distribute the items such that each agent either gets one item or no item, and the total number of items allocated is 9. Here is one way to approach this:

1. Sort the agent valuations for each item and pick the agent with the highest valuation for each item.
2. Assign the item to the respective agent ensuring each agent gets at most one item.

Let's go through the items one by one:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
- **Item 2**: Agent 7 values it the most at 87.
- **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it the most at 93.
- **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it the most at 96.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 37.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most at 78.
- **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.

Now we need to ensure no agent gets more than one item. Adjusting allocations:

- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 1
- **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 0
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 7
- **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 4
- **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 3
- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 6
- **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 5
- **Item 7**: Allocate to Agent 2
- **Item 8**: Allocate to Agent 1 (Note: Agent 1 now has two items, so let's adjust)

To adjust for Agent 1 having two items, let's reallocate Item 8 to another agent:

- **Item 8**: Allocate to Agent 3

This way, each agent gets one item, and Agent 1 has no more than one item. Let's present the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [2]
}
```
