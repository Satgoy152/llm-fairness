Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  48  47  36  45  47  22  35  39
1  80  58  68  89  23  63  34  82   4
2  73  12  37  14   8  35  21  17  96
3  38  15  99   9  19  45  68  68  48
4   1   0  18  69  52  18  12  15  21
5  63  37  59  29  58  65  13  73  94
6  82  54  85  74  11  45  49  52  11
7  39  85  92   2  58  85  90  59  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. This problem resembles a variant of the assignment problem, where we want to pair items with agents in a way that maximizes total valuations.

Given that we have 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each. We will perform a manual allocation based on the highest valuations, ensuring a fair distribution.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 with a valuation of 89.
2. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 with a valuation of 99.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 8 with a valuation of 96.
4. **Agent 7** highly values item 1 with a valuation of 85.
5. **Agent 5** highly values item 5 with a valuation of 65.
6. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 with a valuation of 45.
7. **Agent 6** highly values item 0 with a valuation of 82.
8. **Agent 4** can be given item 7 with a valuation of 15.
9. The remaining item 6 can be given to **Agent 7**, who also values it highly with a valuation of 90.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all 9 items allocated in total, while trying to respect the preferences of the agents based on their valuations.
