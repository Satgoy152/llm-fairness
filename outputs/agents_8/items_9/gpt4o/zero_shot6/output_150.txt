Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  81  21  24  94  14  30  11  77
1  53   0  64  73  75  77  36  88  36
2  35  60  14  74  89  28  31  91  13
3   6  57  61  68  50  77  51  47  42
4  92  15  29  18   8  92  75  66  77
5  21  25   5  96  83  50  70  16  27
6  60  53  38  54  19  36  76  61  24
7   7   1   0  15   3  68  43  45  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, provided it's not already taken by another agent with a higher valuation.
2. Continue the process until all items are assigned.

Based on this strategy, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 94.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the highest at 88.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest at 91, but it's already assigned to Agent 1, so we assign item 4, which Agent 2 values at 89.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 77.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest at 92.
- Agent 5 values item 3 the highest at 96.
- Agent 6 values item 6 the highest at 76.
- Agent 7 values item 8 the highest at 99.

Now, let's ensure every item is assigned, and no agent gets more than one:

- Items assigned: 4, 7, 5, 0, 3, 6, 8 (7 items assigned).
- Items left: 1, 2 (2 items left).

Since items 1 and 2 are unassigned, we can allocate them to the agents with the next highest valuations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value = 81).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value = 64).

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 8 agents.
