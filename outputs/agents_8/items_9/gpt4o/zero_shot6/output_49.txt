Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  30  80  84  91  80  18  55  78
1  52  14  17  31  36  89  16  56  87
2  96  41  65   2  95  31  38  78  97
3  59  28  58   1  86   2  96  28  21
4  93  41  16  43  27  11  25   1  36
5  62  75  94  38  41  23   0  36  15
6  33  37   3  24  55  98  33  87  95
7   3  72  42  10  84  15   1  49  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, while the total allocation equals the number of items available, which is 9. 

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 8, so we allocate item 8 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 4, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 6, so we allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 0, so we allocate item 0 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to agent 5.
7. **Agent 6** has the highest valuation for item 3, so we allocate item 3 to agent 6.
8. **Agent 7** has the highest valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to agent 7.

Now we have allocated 8 items. We need to allocate one more item. Let's allocate item 7 to the agent with the highest remaining valuation who hasn't received an additional item yet.

9. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 7, so we allocate item 7 to agent 2.

Now each agent has received at least one item, and all 9 items have been allocated. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [8, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [1]
}
```
