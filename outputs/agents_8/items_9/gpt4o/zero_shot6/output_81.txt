Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  14  51  52  67  71  47   7  45
1  80  60  74  60  58  88   5  62  58
2  86  71   4  98  85  37   9  52  45
3  96  70  17  62  67  18  88  14  65
4  23   6  48  39  16  62  24  61  87
5  21  90  57  82  43  29  93  83  52
6  16  29  44   1   8  28  29  13  20
7  29  37  63  68  68  89  10  86  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a heuristic approach to balance the total values received by each agent while ensuring every item is allocated.

Given the table and the requirement that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can start by prioritizing the allocation of items to agents who value them the most, while also ensuring that each agent ends up with a few items.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 7],
    "6": [],
    "7": [2, 4]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 6, as they value item 0 highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 5, which aligns with a decent valuation.
- Agent 2 receives item 3, the one with the highest valuation by them.
- Agent 3 receives item 8, due to a relatively high valuation.
- Agent 5 receives items 1 and 7, as they have high valuations for these.
- Agent 7 receives items 2 and 4, due to high valuations as well.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and most agents receive items that they value comparably higher.
