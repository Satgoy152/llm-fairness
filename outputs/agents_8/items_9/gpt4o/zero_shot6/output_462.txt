Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  91  39  92  88  18  21  24  41
1  20  26  62  26  89  67  15  78  63
2  54   8  24  73  60  12  61  68  44
3  59  48  72  53  12  10   6  18  64
4   5  36  68  49  54  89  11  74  84
5  54  83  51  14  69  77  30  78  12
6  82  50  96  14  78  58  20  52  23
7  24  48  42   0  87  55   0  38  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 8 agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. One common approach is to maximize the total utility or value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and the total number of allocated items equals 9. However, since there are only 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will not receive any items in this allocation.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on maximizing individual agent valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 3 (value 92).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 4 (value 89).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 3 (value 73), but item 3 is already taken. Next highest is item 6 (value 61).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 2 (value 72).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 5 (value 89).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value item is 1 (value 83).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value item is 2 (value 96), but item 2 is already taken, so next highest is item 0 (value 82).
8. **Agent 7**: Highest value item is 8 (value 93).

After allocating based on highest values, ensure no items are duplicated and each item is assigned to one agent only. Adjust allocations to ensure fairness and no duplicate assignments.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [1]
- Agent 6: [3]
- Agent 7: [8]

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to one agent, and all items are distributed.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [8]
}
```
