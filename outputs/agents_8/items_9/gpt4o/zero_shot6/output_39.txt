Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  58  45  94   0  20  77  24  16
1  69  72  79  51  45  98  69  63  95
2  87  67  17  16  75  66  71   7  20
3  90  50  62  92  37   1  53  80  88
4  43  32  67  70  21  91  36  16  40
5  10  66  84  10   0  75  56  87  53
6  99  81  32  17  30   8  90  25   8
7  31  53   3  43  74  63  31  89  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: For each item, find the agent who values it the most. This will maximize the total valuation across all items.
   
2. **Allocation**: Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

Let's perform these steps on the given table:

- Item 0: Highest value is 99 by agent 6.
- Item 1: Highest value is 81 by agent 6.
- Item 2: Highest value is 84 by agent 5.
- Item 3: Highest value is 94 by agent 0.
- Item 4: Highest value is 75 by agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest value is 98 by agent 1.
- Item 6: Highest value is 90 by agent 6.
- Item 7: Highest value is 89 by agent 7.
- Item 8: Highest value is 95 by agent 1.

After deciding the allocations based on highest valuations, here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0, 1, 6],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each item going to the agent who values it the most.
