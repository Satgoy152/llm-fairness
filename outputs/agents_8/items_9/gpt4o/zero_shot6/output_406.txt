Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  31  10  50  81  48  58  38  30
1  86  71  21  21  80  38  45  61  92
2  83  93  46  28  81  91  69  38  71
3  74  34  61  50  73  94  96  64  69
4  40  90  89  28  27  89  23  73  56
5  24  23  91  11  85  19  36  43  45
6  81  26  93  72  18  83  40  91  82
7  58  13  32  76  74  34  66  70  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. We will try to allocate based on the highest values each agent has for the items while ensuring fairness in distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 50), item 6 (value 58)
- Agent 1 gets item 8 (value 92)
- Agent 2 gets item 1 (value 93)
- Agent 3 gets item 5 (value 94)
- Agent 4 gets item 2 (value 89)
- Agent 5 gets item 4 (value 85)
- Agent 6 gets item 7 (value 91)
- Agent 7 gets item 0 (value 58)

In this allocation, each agent receives one item except for agent 0, who receives two items. This distribution ensures all items are allocated and that each agent receives at least one item (except for agent 0, who receives two due to the extra item).

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [0]
}
```
