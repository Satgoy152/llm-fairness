Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  97  33  82  37  23  99  42  56
1  59  83   3  45  87  92  61  92  68
2  50  22  18  18  27   5  58  68   0
3  48  56  53  24  42  31  38  61  86
4  42  91  37  25  55  49  95   6  40
5  12  67  91   6  32  87  76  89  47
6   5  22   7  99  66  82   0  11  52
7  18  74  85  17   9  12  98  82  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to make sure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. We'll aim to distribute the items based on maximizing the overall satisfaction of agents, ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations and allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for items 0, 1, 6.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for items 5, 7, 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Low valuations overall, with slightly higher values for items 6, 7.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 8.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 1, 6.
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation for items 2, 5, 7.
7. **Agent 6**: High valuation for item 3.
8. **Agent 7**: High valuation for items 6, 7, 8.

Considering these valuations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [5]
- Agent 2: Items [7]
- Agent 3: Items [8]
- Agent 4: Items [1]
- Agent 5: Items [2]
- Agent 6: Items [3]
- Agent 7: Items [4]

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly based on the agents' valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
