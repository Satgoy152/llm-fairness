Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  88  92  53   7   0  81  61  37
1  68  79  30  29  73  79  90  70  64
2  41  62  69  47  55  88  93  91  69
3  58  47  94  14  45  74   0  18  57
4  50  28  21  79  44  93  12  75  97
5  21  66  80  38  62  38  37   4   8
6  62  44  51  80  20  71  27  45  44
7  34   5  43  64  82  50   5  22  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a similar total valuation based on their preferences. We will do this by examining the valuation matrix and assigning items to agents to balance their total value.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value: 93)
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value: 79)
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value: 94)
4. Assign item 3 to agent 6 (value: 80)
5. Assign item 4 to agent 7 (value: 82)
6. Assign item 5 to agent 4 (value: 93)
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2 (value: 93)
8. Assign item 7 to agent 5 (value: 4)
9. Assign item 8 to agent 4 (value: 97)

This allocation ensures that each agent is assigned at least one item, and the allocation attempts to balance the overall valuation each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 8],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [4]
}
```
