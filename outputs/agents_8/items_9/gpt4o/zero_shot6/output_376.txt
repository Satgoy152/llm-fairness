Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  60  53  27  66  63  33  60  18
1   4  82  63  46  12  59  42  75  90
2  55  58  72  52  92  89  83  70  48
3  13  73  88  44  26   5  77  94  15
4  35  13  18  72  45   2  14  16  19
5  21   9  88  18  35  62  50  46  68
6  47  42  96  20  37  16   3  81  13
7   0   5  82  73  11  85   5  18  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim for a distribution that tries to maximize the total valuation by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given there are 8 agents and 9 items, most agents will get 1 item, and one agent will get 2 items, or we can have a slightly different distribution based on the perceived fairness or total value maximization criteria.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 8
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Item 2
- Agent 6: Item 0
- Agent 7: Item 6

All items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item. Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the distribution while considering the agents' valuations for the items.
