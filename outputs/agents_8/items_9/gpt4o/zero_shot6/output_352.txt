Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  27  62  15  53  41  88  26  18
1   7  36  70  82  58   4  18  26  43
2  98  43  35  11  60   2  74  24  44
3  39   4   4  91  44  21  10  49  10
4  85  90  53  36  35  80  32  37  62
5   7  83  73  35  10  77   1  21  83
6   4  55  51  29  68  88  41  11  17
7  81  24  26  77  44  81  76  82  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is reasonably balanced, considering their individual valuations for the items. Here's a strategy to achieve this:

1. **Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.**
2. **Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations for unallocated items, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the total value.**

Let's go through the allocation process:

- **Agent 0**: Values are [1, 27, 62, 15, 53, 41, 88, 26, 18]. Highest valuations are for items 6 (88) and 2 (62).
- **Agent 1**: Values are [7, 36, 70, 82, 58, 4, 18, 26, 43]. Highest valuations are for items 3 (82) and 2 (70).
- **Agent 2**: Values are [98, 43, 35, 11, 60, 2, 74, 24, 44]. Highest valuations are for items 0 (98) and 6 (74).
- **Agent 3**: Values are [39, 4, 4, 91, 44, 21, 10, 49, 10]. Highest valuation is for item 3 (91).
- **Agent 4**: Values are [85, 90, 53, 36, 35, 80, 32, 37, 62]. Highest valuations are for items 1 (90) and 5 (80).
- **Agent 5**: Values are [7, 83, 73, 35, 10, 77, 1, 21, 83]. Highest valuations are for items 8 (83) and 1 (83).
- **Agent 6**: Values are [4, 55, 51, 29, 68, 88, 41, 11, 17]. Highest valuation is for item 5 (88).
- **Agent 7**: Values are [81, 24, 26, 77, 44, 81, 76, 82, 44]. Highest valuations are for items 0 (81) and 7 (82).

Now, we allocate the items based on these considerations, ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent and that each agent gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: [6]
- **Agent 1**: [3]
- **Agent 2**: [0]
- **Agent 3**: []
- **Agent 4**: [1]
- **Agent 5**: [8]
- **Agent 6**: [5]
- **Agent 7**: [7, 2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest preferences, with a reasonable balance of total value across agents.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [7, 2]
}
```
