Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  70  42  96   4  13   6   7  79
1   3  66   5  15  93  78  10  32  76
2  75  51  64  50  20  59  69  30  60
3  74  84  36   9  49  84  89  17  40
4  14  47  20  67  14  26  43  38  59
5  39  76  22  20  11  99  87   6  58
6  55  24  63  65   6  37  42  63  17
7   4  75  26  46  50  98  26  85  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuations for each item and attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives a roughly equal share of total value. Here's one possible way to allocate the items, keeping in mind the need for fairness and ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible:

1. Start by sorting the items based on agents' valuations.
2. Allocate items to the agents in a round-robin fashion, giving each agent the item they value the most that hasn't been allocated yet.

Here's one possible fair allocation of the items:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [7, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and we have allocated all 9 items. The allocation attempts to balance the value received by each agent based on their individual preferences.
