Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  15  91  94  78   7  55  43   9
1  61  92  55  73  19  52  98  26  74
2  69  52  54  66   6  16  85  47  57
3  83  25  42  62   9  28  74  19  63
4  29  60  12  26  71  17  62  25  19
5   5  69  84  66  96  68  18   9  67
6  83  62  22  14  53   9  43  28  16
7   6  75  63   5  66  89  70  76  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, while maximizing the satisfaction based on their valuations. Given there are 9 items and 8 agents, most agents will receive one item, and one agent will receive two items.

Let's analyze the items and allocate them accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (83).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (92).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (91).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (94).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is by Agent 5 (96).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is by Agent 7 (89).
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (98).
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is by Agent 7 (76).
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is by Agent 7 (94).

Allocating the items based on highest values while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2, Item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Item 1.
- **Agent 2**: No items (since others have higher preferences).
- **Agent 3**: Item 0.
- **Agent 4**: No items (since others have higher preferences).
- **Agent 5**: Item 4.
- **Agent 6**: No items (since others have higher preferences).
- **Agent 7**: Item 5, Item 7, Item 8.

Now, to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, we need to adjust this allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2.
- **Agent 1**: Item 6.
- **Agent 2**: Item 5.
- **Agent 3**: Item 0.
- **Agent 4**: Item 4.
- **Agent 5**: Item 3.
- **Agent 6**: Item 1.
- **Agent 7**: Item 7, Item 8.

Here is the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 9.
