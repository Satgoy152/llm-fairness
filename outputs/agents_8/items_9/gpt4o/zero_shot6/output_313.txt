Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  84  45  27  42  23   5  51  53
1  18  68  37   3  99  60  38  10  45
2  80  97  68  33  75  63  23  43  70
3  80  95  48  47   5  97  52  78   8
4  85  87  78  91  71  61  75  71  23
5  29  10  40  68  15  26  64  61  55
6  10  43  92  88  68  11   6  65  84
7  25  25  89  38  29  43  94  99  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize total satisfaction. One approach is to allocate each item to the agent that values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 with a valuation of 85.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 with a valuation of 97.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 6 with a valuation of 92.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 with a valuation of 91.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 with a valuation of 99.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 3 with a valuation of 97.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by agent 7 with a valuation of 94.
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by agent 7 with a valuation of 99.
9. **Item 8**: The highest valuation is by agent 6 with a valuation of 84.

Based on this allocation strategy, here are the allocations for each agent:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 3],
    "5": [],
    "6": [2, 8],
    "7": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed based on maximizing the agents' valuations.
