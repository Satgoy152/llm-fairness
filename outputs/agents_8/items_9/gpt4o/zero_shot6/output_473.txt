Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  42  92  56  25  66  20  60   5
1  64  17  47  16  61  72  50   7  65
2  76  65  49  19  17  65   2  40   1
3  70  99  32  46  30  71  51  92   9
4  28  23  83  20  64  38  90  27  80
5  65  12  39  77  80  32  44  27  44
6  78  99  65  15  17  29   2  52  38
7  72  64  17  55  27  12  71  64  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 8 agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are assigned, we can use the following strategy: allocate the items based on the highest valuation by each agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and distributing the items efficiently. Here's one way to allocate them:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item that has not been assigned yet.
2. If there are remaining unassigned items after each agent has received one (or as equally distributed as possible), assign these to agents who value them highly.

Following this strategy, here's a proposed allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 2 (Value: 92)
2. Agent 1: Item 5 (Value: 72)
3. Agent 2: Item 0 (Value: 76)
4. Agent 3: Item 1 (Value: 99)
5. Agent 4: Item 6 (Value: 90)
6. Agent 5: Item 4 (Value: 80)
7. Agent 6: Item 7 (Value: 52)
8. Agent 7: Item 3 (Value: 55)

This leaves item 8 unallocated. Let's allocate it based on the highest remaining valuation:

- Agent 4 has the highest remaining valuation for item 8 (Value: 80).

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 8],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item where possible, and all items are distributed.
