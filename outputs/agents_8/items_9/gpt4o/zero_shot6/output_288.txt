Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  48  40  11  57   2  90  83   9
1  31  73  38  81  48  28   6   5  24
2  60  45   1   1  92  89  97  36  52
3  74  88  89  20  76  67  20  25  24
4  13  53  46  98  73  76  71   5   2
5  14  11  85  60  45   5  78   5   3
6  89  25  82  56  76  31  96  37  34
7  64  27  57  55  35  17  98  66  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Given the valuations, we proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 0, 6, and 7. However, since we only need to allocate 9 items and ensure everyone gets at least one item, we'll give Agent 0 the items with the highest values that do not overlap with other agents' top picks.
   
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values are for items 1 and 3.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest values are for items 6 and 4. Since item 6 is highly valued by other agents as well, we will prioritize the item that is unique in their high valuation.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest values are for items 1 and 2, but item 1 is already prioritized for Agent 1. Thus, Agent 3 can have item 2.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest values are for items 3 and 4, but since Agent 1 takes item 3, we allocate item 5.

6. **Agent 5**: The highest values are for item 2. Agent 3 has already taken item 2, so we look for the next best available item.

7. **Agent 6**: The highest values are for items 6 and 0.

8. **Agent 7**: The highest values are for items 6 and 7. Since item 6 is already prioritized for Agent 6, they can have item 7.

Following these considerations, here's a fair allocation of the items:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [7, 8]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets at least one item and all items from 0 to 8 are allocated.
