Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  18  43  78  54  77  90  46  77
1  26  97  35  13   1  90   7  85  70
2  23  66  29  20  52  43  75  71  16
3  27  24  64  64  53   4  81   7   8
4  43  23  65  35  16  67  10  67  36
5  77  67  14  42  81  42  88  27  37
6  66  75  99  71  97  35  86  76  25
7  40  39  80  18  37  95  92  24   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should ensure every agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. We aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction across all agents. Let's try to assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent.

Here's an allocation attempt:

1. Agent 0: Values item 6 the most (value 90), so they get item 6.
2. Agent 1: Values item 1 the most (value 97), so they get item 1.
3. Agent 2: Values item 6 the most (value 75), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 7 (value 71), so they get item 7.
4. Agent 3: Values item 2 the most (value 64), so they get item 2.
5. Agent 4: Values item 2 the most (value 65), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 5 (value 67), so they get item 5.
6. Agent 5: Values item 0 the most (value 77), so they get item 0.
7. Agent 6: Values item 2 the most (value 99), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 4 (value 97), so they get item 4.
8. Agent 7: Values item 5 the most (value 95), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 2 (value 80), but it's also taken. The next highest is item 6 (value 92), but it's taken too. The next highest is item 3 (value 18), so they get item 3.

Now we have assigned 8 items. We have one item left, item 8. Agent 1 has the next highest value for an unassigned item (value 70 for item 8), so we assign item 8 to agent 1.

Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [3]
}
```
