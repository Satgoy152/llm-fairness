Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  90  59  58  22  37  62  64  11
1  30  47  77  72  10   0  22  55  38
2  67  88  75   0  25  22  30  48  95
3  47  47   2  81  70  75  22  20  25
4  67  84  40  34  78  43  80  40  78
5  11  37  18   8   0  84  35  27  78
6  51  91   2  59  16  67  92  63   6
7   5  86  80  24  84  46  33  22  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we iteratively assign each item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated. Here is one such allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 86.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 6 with a value of 91.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 7 with a value of 80.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 3 with a value of 81.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 78.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 5 with a value of 84.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by agent 6 with a value of 92.
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 64.
9. **Item 8**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 with a value of 95.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all items are distributed among the agents. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1, 6],
    "7": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to an agent, and the allocations are made according to maximizing the individual valuations on a per-item basis, considering the constraints given.
