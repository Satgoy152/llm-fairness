Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  61  17  52  68  50  77  64  52
1  82  34  78   4  29  34  87  70  42
2  69  15  25  83  43  34  47  70  17
3  21  45  46   5  75  71  90  15  68
4  14  66  63  32  67  25   1  89  66
5  62  71   2   7  92   6  35  38  39
6  46  14  14  63  98  14  28  48  19
7  67  84  71  20  92  40  49  56  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible. We will use a greedy approach, iterating through the agents and assigning them the item they value the most and that hasn't been allocated yet, until all items are allocated.

We'll perform the allocation step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 6 with a value of 77.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 6, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 0 with a value of 82.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 3 with a value of 83.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 6 (already taken), then item 4 with a value of 75.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 7 with a value of 89.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is for item 4 (already taken), then item 1 with a value of 71.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value is for item 4 (already taken), then item 3 (already taken), then item 0 with a value of 46.
8. **Agent 7**: The highest value is for item 1 (already taken), then item 4 (already taken), then item 0 (already taken), then item 2 with a value of 71.

Now let's check if all items are allocated:
- Allocated items: [6, 0, 3, 4, 7, 1, 2]

We still have items 5 and 8 remaining. We continue to allocate these items:
- **Agent 0**: The remaining highest value is for item 5 with a value of 50.
- **Agent 1**: The remaining highest value is for item 8 with a value of 42.

Now all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [],
    "7": [2]
}
```
