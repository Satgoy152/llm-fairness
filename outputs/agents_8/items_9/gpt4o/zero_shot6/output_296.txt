Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  22  96  60   9  36  40  44  65
1  52  30   3  72  12  42  23  65   6
2  33  10  10  13  62  58  45  11   3
3  61  97  90  57  36  10  59  63  87
4  24  67  90   2  22  49  83  93  93
5  32  52  44  40  99  34  14  27  24
6  26  16  87  87  84  87  88  31  14
7  93  99  62  12  39  96  26  77  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a balanced allocation based on their valuations, while ensuring that all nine items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to maximize the total valuation for the agents:

1. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1.
2. Agent 0 has a very high valuation for item 2.
3. Agent 4 has a high valuation for items 7 and 8.
4. Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 0.
5. Agent 6 has a high valuation for items 3, 5, and 6.

A possible fair allocation, keeping in mind to maximize each agent's total valuation, could be:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 8.
- Agent 5 gets item 5.
- Agent 6 gets item 6.
- Agent 7 gets item 0 and item 7.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [0, 7]
}
```
