Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  32  77   5  96  57  80  71  11
1   0  79  29  98  46  72  65  11  59
2  12  54  28  91  40  86  19  99  84
3  46  76  60  65  84   7  81  65  84
4  66  93  74  27  49  37  27  53   5
5  78  68  56  47  93  48  78  35  40
6  99  46  71  18  29   5  65  88  94
7  13  50  13  76  34  48  85  52  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, with no agent receiving more than two items due to the limited number of items. We also need to consider the agents' valuations to maximize fairness.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 4 (value 96). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 3 (value 98). Assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 7 (value 99). Assign item 7 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 4, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 1 (value 76). Assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 1, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 6 (value 27). Assign item 6 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for agent 5 is item 0 (value 78). Assign item 0 to agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value for agent 6 is item 0, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 8 (value 94). Assign item 8 to agent 6.
8. **Agent 7**: The highest value for agent 7 is item 6, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 3, but it's also taken. Next is item 7, but it's taken. The next option is item 5 (value 48). Assign item 5 to agent 7.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to ensure all items are distributed fairly:

- Item 2 is the only item left. Let's allocate it to the agent with the lowest total value received so far. Agent 4 has the lowest value from a single item currently.

Thus, allocate item 2 to agent 4.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 2],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [5]
}
```
