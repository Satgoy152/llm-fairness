Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  41  51  47  95  33  47   8  81
1  84  88  19  30  95  97  27  74  19
2  98  37  12  82   4  11  30  58   8
3  61  19  81  74  14  75  84  98  86
4  60  22  75  37  29  89  49  27  59
5  74  17  19   9  78  40  61  19  71
6  18  98  27  30  91  59  78  85  36
7  11  38  12  90  16  68  29   5  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a somewhat equitable share based on their valuations. Since we have 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will end up with 2 items while the rest will receive 1 item each.

Let's analyze the valuations to determine a fair allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0 because it has the highest valuation (95) for that item.
2. Assign item 5 to agent 1 because it has the highest valuation (97) for that item.
3. Assign item 3 to agent 2 because it has the highest valuation (82) for that item.
4. Assign item 7 to agent 3 because it has the highest valuation (98) for that item.
5. Assign item 8 to agent 3 because agent 3 has the second-highest valuation (86) for that item, making it equitable for agent 3 to get two items.
6. Assign item 2 to agent 4 because it has the highest valuation (75) for that item.
7. Assign item 0 to agent 5 because agent 5 has a high valuation (74) for that item, which is equitable given the constraints.
8. Assign item 6 to agent 6 because it has the highest valuation (78) for that item.
9. Assign item 1 to agent 7 because it has a relatively high valuation (38) compared to other allocations.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [1]
}
```
