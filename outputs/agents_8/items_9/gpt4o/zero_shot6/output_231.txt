Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  29  11  12  91  56   9  72  94
1  74  99  95  57  13   1  24  40  69
2  42  66  95  87  87  44  76  28  58
3  16  70   7  61  29  49  30   9  80
4  89  75  62  85  63   4  28  66  51
5  28  38  79   3  63  34  93  37  89
6  93  13  59  74   9  77  12  47  53
7  79  49  16  33  61  31  87  15  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations and aim for a distribution where each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated equals the number of items available, which is 9. Here's one possible allocation strategy that ensures fairness and efficiency based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (99).
2. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 8 (94).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2 (95).
4. **Agent 6** has the highest valuation for item 0 (93).
5. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 8, but since it’s already taken by Agent 0, we allocate item 3 (61).
6. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 0, but since it’s already taken by Agent 6, we allocate item 3 (85).
7. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 6 (93).
8. **Agent 7** has the highest valuation for item 7 (15).

Now, let's allocate the remaining item:
- **Agent 7** can take item 4 (61).

The allocation would be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [4, 7]
}
```

This way, each agent gets at least one item, and all items (0 through 8) are allocated.
