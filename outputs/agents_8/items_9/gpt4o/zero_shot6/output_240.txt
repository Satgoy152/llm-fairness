Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  74  92  19  41  48  86  22  89
1  80  37  44  34  95  29  67  68  40
2  54  15  75  85  84  47  34  19  11
3  63  84  46  79  99  38  39   8  35
4  93   3  72   4  35  40   5  99  81
5  18  93  22  94  18  13   6   9   0
6  62  35  37  55  44  78  49  23  21
7  11  36  48  24  57  51   5  13   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 93.
   
2. **Item 1:** 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 5 with a value of 93.
   
3. **Item 2:** 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 92.
   
4. **Item 3:** 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 5 with a value of 94.
   
5. **Item 4:** 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 3 with a value of 99.
   
6. **Item 5:** 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 6 with a value of 78.
   
7. **Item 6:** 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 86.
   
8. **Item 7:** 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 99.
   
9. **Item 8:** 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 89.

Now, let's verify the allocations and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items have been allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6, and 8.
- Agent 1: No items.
- Agent 2: No items.
- Agent 3: Item 4.
- Agent 4: Items 0 and 7.
- Agent 5: Items 1 and 3.
- Agent 6: Item 5.
- Agent 7: No items.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 8],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 7],
    "5": [1, 3],
    "6": [5],
    "7": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items have been allocated.
