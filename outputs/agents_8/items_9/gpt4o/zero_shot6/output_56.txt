Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  85  53  58  90  22   4  40  35
1  79  13  54  56  73  56  96  12  73
2  84  70  87  39  48  63  19  18  22
3  18  57  91  17  60   2  44  28  94
4  33  70  16  84  58  30   2   7  55
5   4  59  78  52   3   8  63   8   4
6  84  85  31  64  86  68  69  22  24
7  22  12  39  18  16  52  33  61   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item or as evenly as possible given there are fewer items than agents. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify which items have the highest values for each agent.
2. Distribute the items trying to maximize overall satisfaction.

By analyzing the table:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highest (90).
- Agent 1 values item 6 highest (96).
- Agent 2 values item 2 highest (87).
- Agent 3 values item 8 highest (94).
- Agent 4 values item 3 highest (84).
- Agent 5 values item 2 second highest (78) since item 2 is already taken, we give item 6 (63).
- Agent 6 values item 4 highest (86), but it's taken, so we give item 0 (84).
- Agent 7 values item 7 highest (61).

With this strategy, some agents will not receive items due to the limited number. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their highest available valued item (or as close to it as possible) given the constraints.
