Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  84  20  56  50  56   0  80  95
1  59  59  67  74  78  46  78  42  18
2   8  50  19  24  76  18  50  44   2
3  53  87  46  63   8  21  50   2  33
4  15  47   1   0  92  88  64  31   7
5  22  63  25  68  74  16  75  24  86
6  65  20  37  83  95   4  17  20  37
7  15  75  80  86  73   7  37  41  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least a reasonable share of the items based on their preferences. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

- Assign items to agents based on their highest preferences while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 8 (value 95, highest for agent 0)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 (value 78, highest not yet allocated)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 50, highest not yet allocated)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3 (value 63, highest not yet allocated)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 5 (value 88, highest not yet allocated)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 2 (value 25, highest not yet allocated)
7. **Agent 6**: Item 6 (value 17, highest not yet allocated)
8. **Agent 7**: Item 7 (value 41, highest not yet allocated)
9. **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 59, next highest preference not yet allocated for this agent)

With this allocation, each item is assigned to one agent, and preferences are considered to a reasonable degree.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [7]
}
```
