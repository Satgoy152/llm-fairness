Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  47  91  13  26  83   3   0  67
1  78   0   6  86  44  67  44  94  33
2  56  71   0   1  47   1   2   3  41
3  79  44  84  72  83  29  36  88  93
4  60  33  69  59  66  46   6  21  33
5  83  77  82  73  84  47  57  26  18
6   4  73  65  63  38  60  64  60  29
7  40  52   2  95  29  45  43  24  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, while also ensuring each agent receives approximately the same number of items.

Given there are 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one item each. Here's a possible allocation that considers the valuations:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (99), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 7 (94), so allocate item 7 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 1 (71), so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 8 (93), so allocate item 8 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 2 (69), so allocate item 2 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 highly values item 4 (84), so allocate item 4 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 highly values item 6 (64), so allocate item 6 to agent 6.
8. Agent 7 highly values item 3 (95), so allocate item 3 to agent 7.

Now we have all agents with one item, except for one item remaining (item 5). We need to allocate this additional item to an agent who values it relatively highly. Agent 0 values item 5 at 83, which is a high valuation, so assign item 5 to agent 0.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [3]
}
```
