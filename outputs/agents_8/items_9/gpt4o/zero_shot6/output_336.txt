Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  36  53  30  45   4  33  81  83
1  85   9   0  74  95  96  97  45  71
2  59  97  48   9  51  30  49  18  50
3  13  78   7   5  74   7  80  69  38
4  38  73  84  57  69  76  87   5  77
5   1  79  23   1  57  68  42  99  61
6  98  80  30  72  53  70  68  38  69
7  60  95   9  58  33  42  40  53  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives an equitable share based on their valuations. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one of the agents can receive one extra item to ensure all items are allocated. We'll aim to distribute based on maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations each agent has for a particular item.
2. Ensure that no item is allocated to more than one agent.
3. Attempt to distribute the items so that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on these criteria:

1. Agent 0: Item 7 (value: 81)
2. Agent 1: Item 6 (value: 97)
3. Agent 2: Item 1 (value: 97)
4. Agent 3: Item 4 (value: 74)
5. Agent 4: Item 6 (value: 87) - already assigned, choose next highest, Item 8 (value: 77)
6. Agent 5: Item 7 (value: 99) - already assigned, choose next highest, Item 5 (value: 68)
7. Agent 6: Item 0 (value: 98)
8. Agent 7: Item 1 (value: 95) - already assigned, choose next highest, Item 3 (value: 58)

Items yet to be allocated: 2, 3, 5

Reallocate remaining items:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (value: 53)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (value: 96) 
- Agent 2: Item 3 (value: 9)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents and attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Note that one agent ended up with no items due to the distribution, which can be adjusted by reallocating if desired.
