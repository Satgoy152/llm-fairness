Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  20  98   5  75  31  42  33  91
1  51  83  25  11  17  41  12  52  85
2  65  55  88  10   7  68  78  43  29
3  42  17  29  62  57  49  77  20  59
4  90  62  27  23  72  67  49  91  27
5  36  83  96   5  85  81  96  84  36
6  35  18  22  54   5  64  55  65  70
7  30  74  96  14  41  61  20  20  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, wherever possible, while maximizing the total valuation. One reasonable approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 94.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 83.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 98.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most at 62.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 5 values it the most at 85.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 5 values it the most at 81.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 5 values it the most at 96.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it the most at 91.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it the most at 85.

Now, let's make sure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 8.
- Agent 2 receives no items, so we need to adjust.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives item 7.
- Agent 5 receives items 4, 5, and 6.
- Agent 6 receives no items, so we need to adjust.
- Agent 7 receives no items, so we need to adjust.

Since Agent 2, Agent 6, and Agent 7 received no items, we need to adjust the allocation to ensure at least some of them get items. We can make the following adjustments:

- Give item 5 to Agent 6 instead of Agent 5.
- Give item 8 to Agent 7 instead of Agent 1.

Here's the final allocation ensuring fairness:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4, 6],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items, maximizing the total valuations while distributing items fairly among the agents.
