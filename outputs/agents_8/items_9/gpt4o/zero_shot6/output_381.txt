Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  79  81  61  55  78  95  48  14
1  87  28  46  56  52  73  21  31  12
2  52  21  88   4  44  43  79  23  62
3  74  43  47  78   7  68  45  26  85
4  80  64  86  86  85  15  48  12  54
5  89  79  57   3   2  22  10  32  65
6  48  28  55  35  29  49  50  72  33
7  90  66   6  30  94  34  38  30  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of all agents, considering their valuations for each item. However, with 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will naturally receive more than one item.

Here's one potential fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 6 (value 95)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (value 87)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (value 88)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value 78)
- Agent 4: Items 4 and 7 (values 85 and 12 respectively)
- Agent 5: Item 1 (value 79)
- Agent 6: Item 5 (value 49)
- Agent 7: Item 8 (value 70)

This allocation attempts to give each agent one of their higher-valued items, with agent 4 receiving two items due to having higher overall valuations in this distribution context.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [8]
}
```
