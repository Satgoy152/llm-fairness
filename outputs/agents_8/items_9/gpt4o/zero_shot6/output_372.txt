Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  58  93  94  78  29  12  92  93
1  49  44  77  44  19  47  91  67  61
2  16  55  49  66  77  94  57  26  39
3  59  91  31  55  56  20   8  10  89
4  12  58  84  17  60  21  57  74  12
5  21  27  73  22  46  98  28  81  27
6  57  36  10  24   4  18  53  37  83
7  70  81  18  64  60  19   0   1   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, but since there are only 9 items and 8 agents, one of the agents must receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each. We'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items 0 and 3 (highest valuation items for the agent).
2. Agent 1: Item 6 (highest valuation item for the agent).
3. Agent 2: Item 5 (highest valuation item for the agent).
4. Agent 3: Item 1 (highest valuation item for the agent).
5. Agent 4: Item 2 (highest valuation item for the agent).
6. Agent 5: Item 7 (highest valuation item for the agent).
7. Agent 6: Item 8 (highest valuation item for the agent).
8. Agent 7: Item 4 (highest valuation item for the agent).

The allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9. The allocations maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [4]
}
```
