Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  52  33  77  34  33  13  51   7
1  34  93  72  86  93  75  45  67  42
2  11   0  39  60  13   4  82  46  41
3  65   3  34  41  96  88  54   6  93
4  70  54  60  50  85  12  54  85  90
5   0  36  31  62   8  64  88  80  76
6  74  41  51  15   9  50  26  26  85
7  51  15  22  33  16  93  55  93  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items considering their valuations. Since we have 9 items and 8 agents, some agents may not receive any items, and one agent will receive 2 items. We will attempt to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly, ensuring a fair distribution based on their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3] (Value 77)
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4] (Values 93, 93)
- Agent 2: Items [6] (Value 82)
- Agent 3: Items [8] (Value 93)
- Agent 4: Items [2] (Value 60)
- Agent 5: Items [] (No items allocated)
- Agent 6: Items [0] (Value 74)
- Agent 7: Items [5, 7] (Values 93, 93)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, with agent 1 receiving two items due to their high valuation tied to those items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [5, 7]
}
```
