Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  92  12  92  60  64  52  75  59
1  84  18  90  34  58  46  39  52  31
2  25  27  39  21  56  26  64  94  32
3  76  17  99  42  48  51  30  56  79
4  21  70  22  52  10  36  59  58  58
5  55  97  90  56  59  69  63  68  27
6  23  88  86  14  54   5  13  63  50
7  37   7  30  17  36  13  46  71  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the preferences and valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to allocate all 9 items such that the distribution is fair and each agent feels they have received a satisfactory allocation based on their valuations. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to the agents who value them most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, while still allocating all 9 items.

Below is a possible allocation given the constraints:

- Assign item 2 to agent 3 (highest value 99)
- Assign item 7 to agent 2 (highest value 94)
- Assign item 1 to agent 5 (highest value 97)
- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (highest value 91)
- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (highest value 92)
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 58, next highest value)
- Assign item 5 to agent 5 (highest remaining value 69)
- Assign item 8 to agent 7 (highest remaining value 88)
- Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value 59, highest among remaining unallocated items)

Based on the above logic, the allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1, 5],
    "6": [],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents while considering their highest valuations for specific items.
