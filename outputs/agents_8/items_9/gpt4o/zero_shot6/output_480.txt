Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  65  89  84  84  38   6   9  57
1  53  51  76  27  89  40  82   2  68
2  44  60  79  90  39  65  76  29  52
3  40  95  61  90  75  91  55  17  12
4  50  73  98  67  89  84  44  27  63
5  18  88  86  76  82   8  36  94   1
6  58  82  74  12  73  59  15  33  34
7  71  83  21  81  71  22  40  16  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers the agents' valuations to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 8 agents and 9 items, at least one agent will receive more than one item.

One possible allocation strategy is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the highest valuation for each item and the corresponding agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring no agent receives more than one item until all agents have at least one item.
3. If there are remaining items after each agent has received one, assign the remaining items to the agents with the next highest valuations.

Applying this strategy to the given data:

- Item 0: Agent 7 has the highest valuation (71).
- Item 1: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (95).
- Item 2: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (98).
- Item 3: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (90).
- Item 4: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (89).
- Item 5: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (91).
- Item 6: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (82).
- Item 7: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (94).
- Item 8: Agent 7 has the highest valuation (77).

Now ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: No initial allocations.
- Agent 1: Items [4, 6] initially, give one to another agent if needed.
- Agent 2: Item [3].
- Agent 3: Items [1, 5], give one to another agent if needed.
- Agent 4: Item [2].
- Agent 5: Item [7].
- Agent 6: No initial allocations.
- Agent 7: Items [0, 8].

Reallocating to ensure fairness and integer items per agent:

- Agent 0: Take item 6 from Agent 1.
- Agent 3: Keep item 1, give item 5 to Agent 6.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [0, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed fairly based on valuations.
