Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  47  60  60  87  47  68  20  21
1  93  71  41  14  24  77  89  48  67
2  84  43  48   8  12  36   9  35  33
3  61  37  60  86  84   2  45  78  95
4  72  64  44  36  56  18  86  31  72
5  52  68  87  40  38  22  74   1  51
6  90  94  33  33  72  42   6  13  28
7   1  90   9   0  66  70  30  69  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method to assign items based on the highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and make adjustments to ensure fairness.

Based on the values provided:

- Item 0: Highest value is 93 by agent 1.
- Item 1: Highest value is 94 by agent 6.
- Item 2: Highest value is 87 by agent 5.
- Item 3: Highest value is 86 by agent 3.
- Item 4: Highest value is 87 by agent 0.
- Item 5: Highest value is 77 by agent 1.
- Item 6: Highest value is 89 by agent 1.
- Item 7: Highest value is 78 by agent 3.
- Item 8: Highest value is 95 by agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5, 6
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7, 8
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: Item 2
- Agent 6: Item 1
- Agent 7: No items

Now let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 5, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 7, 8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1],
    "7": []
}
```
