Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  74  49  98  19  35  79  72  98
1   1  76  33  24  86  77  92  56  49
2  16  57  36  96  91  78  65  11  90
3  81  50  45  21  20   8  81  47  45
4   5  91  57  63  69  64  58  34  96
5   3  10  71  70  91  68  68  23  17
6  98  38  65  92   9  72  63  44  52
7  55  13  31  20   1  30  99  61  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that every agent gets at least one item and all 9 items are distributed. One common approach is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences. Let's try to do this:

1. First, identify the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Allocate that item if it hasn't been allocated yet.
3. If an item has already been allocated, move to the next highest valued item for that agent.
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until all items are allocated.

Let's implement this:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest with 98.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest with 92.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest with 96.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest with 81.
5. Agent 4 values item 8 the highest with 96.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 the highest with 91.
7. Agent 6 values item 0 the highest with 98.
8. Agent 7 values item 6 the highest with 99.

Now let's try to allocate these items based on the highest preferences:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 since Agent 0 and Agent 2 both want it, but Agent 2 values it more.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 7 since Agent 1 and Agent 7 both want it, but Agent 7 values it more.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 6, who values it the most.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 5.

For the remaining unassigned items [1, 2, 5, 7], assign them based on remaining highest preferences:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, who values it next highest.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3, who values it next highest.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0, who values it next highest.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1, who values it next highest after item 1.

Now, verify that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [6]
}
```
