Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  97  63  94  68  16  81  44  38
1  83  38  96  57  88  95  41  55  93
2  40  30  54  90  88   0  90  23  51
3  23  93  91  53   8  29  66  40  80
4  28  90  92  75   0  54  13  84  52
5  20  41  90  19  95   1  29  52  69
6  45  44  37   2  98  89  37  83  97
7  14  49  17  77  76  79  95  42  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to balance the allocation based on the given valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and exactly 9 items are allocated in total. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by analyzing each agent's highest valued items.
2. Assign each agent at least one item based on their preferences or high valuation.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (value 97)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (value 96)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (value 90)
- Agent 3: Item 8 (value 80)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (value 84)
- Agent 5: Item 4 (value 95)
- Agent 6: Item 5 (value 89)
- Agent 7: Item 6 (value 95)
- Agent 0: Item 0 (value 51)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total sum of items allocated is 9.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [6]
}
```
