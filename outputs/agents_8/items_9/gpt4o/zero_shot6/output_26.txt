Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95   9  13  34  40  99  59  16  25
1  49  47  89  66   7   5  55  70   7
2   8  65  66   9  60  72  56  16  62
3  32  38  24  85  54  91  21   1  90
4  16  96  82  58   8  31  32  55  13
5  29  12  22  62  29   5  94   9  97
6  59  96  13  59  48  86   3  62  82
7  49  23  62  91  48  72   4  47  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that each agent receives at least one item while maximizing the total value for each agent. One approach is to use a simple greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 0 (Value: 95, highest for Agent 0)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 2 (Value: 89, highest for Agent 1)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 5 (Value: 72, highest for Agent 2)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 3 (Value: 85, highest for Agent 3)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Item 1 (Value: 96, highest for Agent 4)

6. **Agent 5**: 
   - Item 6 (Value: 94, highest for Agent 5)

7. **Agent 6**: 
   - Item 8 (Value: 82, highest for Agent 6)

8. **Agent 7**: 
   - Item 7 (Value: 47, highest for Agent 7)

9. Assign the remaining item based on the next highest valuation:
   - Agent 3 could also receive Item 4 (Value: 54), which is the next highest unallocated item value for any agent.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item.
