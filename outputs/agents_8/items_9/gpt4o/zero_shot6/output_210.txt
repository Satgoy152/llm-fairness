Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  12  28  97  99  84  19  66  98
1  55  94  81  47  81  33  25  24   0
2  49  68  49  13   1  15  85  20  14
3  27  12  47  35  29  14  39  22  68
4  54   6   1  53  97   9  56  90   6
5  30  66  56  47  63  46  37   5  42
6  50  16  55   1  25  57  91   7  43
7  18  35  97  96  19  83   8  43  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Determine which items are most valued by each agent.
2. Try to assign items to agents that value them most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Ensure all 9 items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation based on maximizing values:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 (99) the most.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 (94) the most.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 (85) the most.
4. Agent 3 values item 8 (68) the most.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 (53) the most.
6. Agent 5 values item 2 (56) the most.
7. Agent 6 values item 5 (57) the most.
8. Agent 7 values item 7 (43) the most.

Now, we need to check if all items have been allocated. Upon review, items 0, 1, and 5 have not been allocated yet. We can assign item 0 to Agent 0, item 1 to Agent 1, and item 5 to Agent 6, as these items are among the highest remaining values for these agents.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while considering the agents' valuations.
