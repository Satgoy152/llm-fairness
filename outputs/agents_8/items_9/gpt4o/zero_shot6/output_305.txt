Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  84  49  52  99   7  48  42  93
1  44  64  98  28  99  26  34  28  71
2  69   0  44  75  17  29  10   8  41
3  26  94  24   5  34  79   3   4  99
4  32  79  29  87   8  40  29  60  69
5  76  35  97  40  56  30  31  31  93
6   4  65  58  98  20   8  39  37  29
7  85  33  65  59  52  96  12  78  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent gets a chance to receive an item based on their valuations. Since there are more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item. 

Here is one possible allocation that ensures each agent gets at least one item and no items are left unallocated:

1. Assign the highest valued items to agents first, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
2. Continue assigning items to maximize the overall valuation of the assignments.

Following this strategy, here is how the allocation could be done:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 99)
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 98)
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 75)
- Agent 3 gets item 8 (value 99)
- Agent 4 gets item 1 (value 79)
- Agent 5 gets item 0 (value 76)
- Agent 6 gets item 6 (value 39)
- Agent 7 gets item 5 (value 96)
- Agent 7 also gets item 7 (value 78) as they have the highest remaining valuation for any item.

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent gets at least one item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [5, 7]
}
```
