Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  76  83  76  16  96  57  91  47
1  36  16  30  61   4  14  84  72  40
2  12   9  22  55  81  61  40  36  71
3  13  13  52  88  37  31  63  54  43
4  22  47  77  62  33   9  45  71  35
5  86  27  62  84  61  67  98  23  21
6  92  53  18  75  68  70  58  26  95
7  28  23  74  31  49  71  78  81  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets items they value highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share. Given there are 9 items and 8 agents, some agents will receive only one item while others may receive two.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most (value of 96).
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most (value of 84).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most (value of 81).
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the most (value of 88).
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most (value of 77).
6. Agent 5 values item 6 the most, but since it's already taken, item 0 is the next highest (value of 86).
7. Agent 6 values item 8 the most (value of 95).
8. Agent 7 values item 7 the most (value of 81).

Now, let's check if all items are allocated: items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 have been allocated, leaving item 1 unallocated. Since agent 1 has only one item, let's give item 1 to agent 1 as well (value of 16).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This ensures that all 9 items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
