Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  57  72  88  78  29  19  72  77
1  82  80  28  95  99  19  77  27  35
2   7  23  39  92  58  59  17  88  38
3  19  14  17  44  49  96  49  38  12
4  95  71  14  29  79  68  85  96  67
5  84   0  94  78  69  91  62  75   9
6  34  47  56  87  76  72  74  87  26
7  67  53  78  40  41  51  96  67  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that each agent receives items with high valuations according to the table provided. Given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive an additional item compared to the others.

Here's an allocation that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent:

1. Agent 0: [3] (Item 3 has the highest valuation for agent 0)
2. Agent 1: [4] (Item 4 has the highest valuation for agent 1)
3. Agent 2: [7] (Item 7 has the highest valuation for agent 2)
4. Agent 3: [5] (Item 5 has the highest valuation for agent 3)
5. Agent 4: [0] (Item 0 has the highest valuation for agent 4)
6. Agent 5: [2] (Item 2 has the highest valuation for agent 5)
7. Agent 6: [6] (Item 6 has the highest valuation for agent 6)
8. Agent 7: [1, 8] (Items 1 and 8 have relatively high valuations for agent 7, and agent 7 receives two items to ensure all items are allocated)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [1, 8]
}
```
