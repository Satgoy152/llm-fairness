Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  14  61  63  68  32  73   8   3
1  77  48  39  96   0  82  41  17  60
2   6  74  66  81  42  89  77  59  78
3  27  56  83  73  53  68   1  58  11
4  50  56   4  49  43  87  43  70  56
5  28  32  36  21  70  44  52  20  69
6  55  64  45  40  66  21  80  14  81
7  57  37  69  90  76  13  22   0  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and ensure that all 9 items are distributed among the 8 agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.

Let's start by examining the valuations and assigning the items to maximize fairness:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 6, 3, and 4.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3, 0, and 5.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5, 8, and 3.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 5.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 5, 7, and 1.
6. Agent 5 has high valuations for items 8, 4, and 6.
7. Agent 6 has high valuations for items 6, 8, and 4.
8. Agent 7 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 2.

We will distribute the items to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [7]
- Agent 5: [8]
- Agent 6: [6]
- Agent 7: [4, 1]

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
