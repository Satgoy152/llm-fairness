Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  62  58  25  24  52  42  56  52
1  50  82  62  85  96  25  47  69  80
2  54  51  71  20  42  18  20   6  12
3   3  71  91  80  23  56  12  13   4
4  48  42  20  74   8  87  65  33  77
5  86  14  65  87  99  22  12  60  10
6  81  63  66  96  27  17  13  20  33
7  12  46  41  97  24  34  53  64  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given that there are more agents than items, at least some agents will not receive any items. We will aim to distribute items to maximize the satisfaction based on the valuations provided.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 1 (62)
2. Agent 1: Item 4 (96)
3. Agent 2: Item 2 (71)
4. Agent 3: Item 3 (80)
5. Agent 4: Item 5 (87)
6. Agent 5: Item 0 (86)
7. Agent 6: Item 8 (33)
8. Agent 7: Item 7 (64)

This allocation attempts to give each agent one of the items they value relatively higher.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [7]
}
```
