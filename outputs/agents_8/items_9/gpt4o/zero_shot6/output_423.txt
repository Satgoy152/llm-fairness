Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6   5   4  48  98  89  63  22  24
1  37  40  20  30  40  81  62  15  98
2  39  62  47  61  20  20  76  20  45
3  77   4  70  88   7  81  97  57  84
4  28  10  14  52  72  43  32   1  40
5  82  69  88  20   4  29  62  98  60
6  78  45  17  14  32  82  69  31  90
7  36   3  31  94   5  11   5  69  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve that:

1. **Agent 0:** Allocated items: [4]
   - Value: 98

2. **Agent 1:** Allocated items: [8]
   - Value: 98

3. **Agent 2:** Allocated items: [6]
   - Value: 76

4. **Agent 3:** Allocated items: [3]
   - Value: 88

5. **Agent 4:** Allocated items: [0]
   - Value: 28

6. **Agent 5:** Allocated items: [2]
   - Value: 88

7. **Agent 6:** Allocated items: [5]
   - Value: 82

8. **Agent 7:** Allocated items: [1, 7]
   - Values: 3, 69

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly, maximizing the total value for each agent based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [1, 7]
}
```
