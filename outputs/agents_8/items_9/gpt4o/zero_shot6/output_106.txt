Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58   2  77  84  24  69  77  95  90
1  50  59  35  95  59  86  47  91  97
2  33  92  70  49  82  29  96  99  22
3  55  28   7   3  12   2  44  76  60
4  50  88  41  49  26  79  92  62   7
5  35  39  66  52  76   4  59  19  90
6  91  63  25  83  12  18  14  13  89
7  36   4  81   3  45  99   0  91  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed, we can use a method that maximizes the sum of valuations each agent receives while ensuring fairness.

One possible allocation strategy is to examine the highest valuations first to ensure that agents get items they value the most while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [8]
- Agent 2: Item [7]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [2]
- Agent 5: Item [0]
- Agent 6: Item [5]
- Agent 7: Item [4]

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it highly, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [4]
}
```
