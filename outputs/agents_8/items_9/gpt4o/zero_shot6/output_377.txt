Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  24  22  59  21  51   8  10  72
1  62  50  18  13  61  55   4  21  58
2   3  60  99  98  34  56  35  26  85
3  14  13  48  76  59  94   7  32  59
4  47  15   1  79  62  61  44  18  67
5  31  59  65  41  43  87  40  55  21
6  63  13  54  92  56   4  25  11  18
7   2  85  54  34  62  17  15  43  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable and fair distribution based on the given valuations. Here's one possible allocation that seeks to respect the values each agent places on the items while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent is considered:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 0, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 8, which have relatively high values for them.
- Agent 2 receives item 2, which is highly valued by them.
- Agent 3 receives item 5, which they value second highest.
- Agent 4 receives item 3, which is highly valued by them.
- Agent 5 receives item 1, which they value moderately.
- Agent 6 receives item 7, which is the highest valued item that doesn't create conflicts.
- Agent 7 receives item 6, which they value moderately.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent is considered, while attempting to respect the valuations the agents have for the items.
