Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  16  48  24  96  76  46  25  34
1  45  18  82  38  32  14  75  90  92
2   7  22  15  14  32  52  51  95  27
3  43  27   7  38  10  67  24  45  28
4  59  20   9   7  49  65  78  66  17
5  56  71  26  41  64  14   5  10  43
6  71  24  58  69  43  70  72  52  19
7  20  86  52  10  50   6  61  26  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations table and aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. Here's one way to do it, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and maximizing the overall value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 4 (96). Assign item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 8 (92). Assign item 8.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 7 (95). Assign item 7.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 5 (67). Assign item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 6 (78). Assign item 6.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value for item 1 (71). Assign item 1.
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value for item 0 (71). Assign item 0.
8. **Agent 7**: Highest value for item 2 (86). Assign item 2.

Now, we have allocated 8 items. We need to allocate one more item. Let's choose an item that maximizes the fairness:

9. **Agent 3**: Next highest remaining value is item 3 (38). Assign item 3.

All items have been allocated, and each agent has received at least one item. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [2]
}
```
