Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91   5  87  13  35  55  71   9  94
1  29  52  66  64  58  68  29  92  34
2  91  27  56  52  64  38  51  57   9
3  28  48  29  62  11  84   7  52  57
4  57  21  61  81  89  23  85  38   6
5  22  58  17   1  31  15  41  47  52
6  49  79  45  81  41  34  63  40   4
7  85  68  14  76  43  99  21  15  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives or ensure a balanced distribution of value. Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance value among agents:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value: 91 for agent 0)
2. Assign item 1 to agent 6 (value: 79 for agent 6)
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value: 87 for agent 0)
4. Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value: 81 for agent 4)
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value: 89 for agent 4)
6. Assign item 5 to agent 7 (value: 99 for agent 7)
7. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value: 85 for agent 4)
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 (value: 92 for agent 1)
9. Assign item 8 to agent 0 (value: 94 for agent 0)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 8],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 4, 6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [5]
}
```
