Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  82  28  78  13  46  26   8   2
1  22  72  27  81   9  57  43  69  15
2  52  13  51  21  74  34  85  93  70
3  18  28  46  39   4  28  11   2  30
4  22  34  91  18   5  94  54  12  41
5  13  17  51  24  10  14  76   1   9
6  69   7  41  66  11  71  94  37  57
7  40  50  97  59  68  19  83   3  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's preferences based on the valuations given in the table. The aim is to distribute the 9 items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is fair. 

One possible approach is to allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each item, ensuring that each item goes to the agent who values it the most. Let's proceed with this method:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is 69 by Agent 6.
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is 82 by Agent 0.
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is 97 by Agent 7.
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is 81 by Agent 1.
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is 74 by Agent 2.
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is 94 by Agent 4.
7. Item 6: The highest valuation is 94 by Agent 6 (already has item 0, so let's check the next highest).
8. Item 7: The highest valuation is 93 by Agent 2 (already has item 4, so let's check the next highest).
9. Item 8: The highest valuation is 70 by Agent 2 (already has item 4 and can't take more, so let's check for others).

Adjusting allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Allocate item 6 to Agent 4 instead of Agent 6, since Agent 4 only has one item.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 5, who has not been assigned any items yet.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 3, who has not been assigned any items yet.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5, 6],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.
