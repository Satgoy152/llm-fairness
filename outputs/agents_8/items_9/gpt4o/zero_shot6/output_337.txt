Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  79  73  93  63  38  69  58  99
1  53  14  40  54  48  29  55   2  98
2  30  89  11  55  41  88  72  33  11
3  60  63  89  21  46  52  92  73  81
4  56  94  76  67  29  35  42  83  10
5  23  10  82  77  87  95  15  17  49
6  98  15  10  99  11  55  35  18  53
7  95  58  36  17  45  99  66  95   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the total value of items allocated to each agent is balanced as much as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values Item 7 the highest at 58.
2. Agent 1 values Item 8 the highest at 98.
3. Agent 2 values Item 1 the highest at 89.
4. Agent 3 values Item 6 the highest at 92.
5. Agent 4 values Item 1 the highest at 94 (already allocated), so the next highest is Item 7 at 83.
6. Agent 5 values Item 5 the highest at 95.
7. Agent 6 values Item 3 the highest at 99.
8. Agent 7 values Item 5 the highest at 99 (already allocated), so the next highest is Item 0 at 95.

Now, let's check for any unallocated items and adjust:

- Item 4 is unallocated.
- We will assign it to Agent 4, who has a relatively lower total valuation with one item, to balance the allocation.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7, 4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
