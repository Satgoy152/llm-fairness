Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  84  82  93  67  90  49  90  57
1   9  50  26  34  39  77   7  75  88
2  22  22  45  71  48  21  89  67  91
3  67  91  69  28  72   1  37  16   6
4  94  49  52   1  22   9  48  99  98
5  34  31  71  11  73  89  37  99   9
6  44   4  30  22  99  90  23  62  66
7  68  79  17   7  81   8  43  82  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 8 agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the overall allocation maximizes the satisfaction based on the given valuations. However, as we have 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items and others will receive one item each. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. First, let's sort each agent's highest valued items and allocate the highest value items to different agents.
2. Then, allocate the remaining items to agents with lower total values to balance the allocation.

Below is a possible allocation based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (value: 93)
- Agent 1: Item 8 (value: 88)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (value: 89)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (value: 91)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (value: 99)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (value: 89)
- Agent 6: Item 4 (value: 99)
- Agent 7: Items 0 and 2 (values: 68 and 17) - Agent 7 gets two items

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is distributed based on the highest valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [0, 2]
}
```
