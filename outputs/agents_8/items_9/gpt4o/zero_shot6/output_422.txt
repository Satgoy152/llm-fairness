Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  97  19  82  87  62  98  10  16
1  41  40  68  27  71  93  50  29   3
2  68   3  14  26  50  88  25  64  79
3  72  63  82  52   8  28  46  94  72
4  90  22  50  19  18  82  88  39  32
5  17  42  19  67   2  73  82   1  22
6  90  90  42  43  11  32  80  44   6
7  48  15  95  70  48  35  93  78  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider how to distribute the 9 items so that each agent has a fair chance based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Compute the total valuation each agent assigns to all items to get a sense of their overall interest.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If some agents end up with significantly more items or significantly higher total value, adjust the allocation to ensure a more balanced distribution.

Here is a proposed allocation based on these steps:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item (where possible), and the items are distributed among the agents while focusing on their highest valuations. The allocation doesn't exceed the total number of items, which is 9.
