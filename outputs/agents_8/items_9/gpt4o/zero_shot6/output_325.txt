Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  79  59  36  21  61  98  28  86
1   4  81  77  54  75  11  97  56  36
2  13  37  70  28  59  31  91  24  77
3  16   4  78  61  22  45  18  67  87
4   9  58  22  74  22   1  82  77  54
5  98   3  84  45  86  95  79  35  36
6  61  54  40  54  46  54  45  92  17
7  40  98   9  68  12  19  61  22  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We'll consider the valuations and attempt to distribute the items to maximize fairness and individual agent satisfaction. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 98)
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 75)
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 70)
- Agent 3 gets item 8 (value 87)
- Agent 4 gets item 7 (value 77)
- Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 95)
- Agent 6 gets item 3 (value 54)
- Agent 7 gets items 1 and 0 (values 98 and 40, respectively)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations of the items. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [1, 0]
}
```
