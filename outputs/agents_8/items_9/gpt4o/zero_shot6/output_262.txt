Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63   0  10  91  90  95   5  93  14
1  28  41  38  11  76  21  26  22  47
2   2  72  78  84  58  44  15  63  63
3  69  26  33  19  29  55   9  78  38
4   3  84  63  10  51  91  88  42  43
5  77  25  45  13  19  29  71  10  68
6  65  95  86  21  63   9   7  27  11
7  93  94  98  71  88  64  98  90  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the constraints, I'll attempt a fair allocation based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items.

Here is one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most, so they get item 5.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most, so they get item 4.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most, so they get item 2.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the most, so they get item 7.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most, so they get item 1.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most, so they get item 0.
- Agent 6 values item 3 the most, so they get item 3.
- Agent 7 values items 6 and 8 the most, so they get items 6 and 8.

This ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it highly, and all items are distributed.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [6, 8]
}
```
