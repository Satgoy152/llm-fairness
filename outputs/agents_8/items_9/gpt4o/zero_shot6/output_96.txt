Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  43  21  79  41  43  38  64  25
1  56  32  83  45  65  68  66  24  28
2  95  20  18  29  23  46  40  69  45
3  87  96  93  57  89  55  63  55  17
4  98  96  65  28  53  24  31  54   6
5  38  79  39  38  61  80  44  67  91
6  52  72  16  90  61  67  89   5  39
7   3  78  80  23  47  49  20  70  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we can follow a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, given there are 8 agents and 9 items. We can achieve this by first identifying the highest valuation each agent has for any item and then allocating items based on these valuations. However, since there are more items than agents, one agent will receive two items. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for any item and allocate that item to the agent.
2. Ensure one agent receives an additional item to make a total of 9 item allocations.

Let's go through the table and allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Highest value is 82 for item 0.
- Agent 1: Highest value is 83 for item 2.
- Agent 2: Highest value is 95 for item 0, but it's already taken. Next highest is 69 for item 7.
- Agent 3: Highest value is 96 for item 1.
- Agent 4: Highest value is 98 for item 0, but it's already taken. Next highest is 96 for item 1, but it's taken. Next is 65 for item 2; also taken. So, take item 3 with value 28.
- Agent 5: Highest value is 91 for item 8.
- Agent 6: Highest value is 90 for item 3, but it's taken. Next highest is 89 for item 6.
- Agent 7: Highest value is 80 for item 2, but it's taken. Next highest is 78 for item 1, but it's taken. Next is 72 for item 8; also taken. So, take item 5 with value 49.

Now, allocate the remaining item(s) to ensure all 9 items are distributed:

- Item 4 is left unallocated. We should assign it to the agent who would benefit the most from an additional item.
- Agent 1 has a good secondary valuation for item 4 with value 65.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving at least one item, and one agent receiving two items.
