Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  63  90  27  14  24   0  43   4
1  13   9  55  79   2  64  75  88  99
2  92  52  21  65  76  24  32  23  73
3  92  45  33  75  62  52  81  79   4
4  62  54   6  56  29  63   5  78  24
5  15  49  45  96  97  31  40  21  60
6  15  81   6  91  76  70  52  46  20
7  57  72   5  92  57  46  67  93  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent. Since there are 8 agents and 9 items, it means some agents might receive more than one item, while some might receive none.

A possible approach is to give each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's find such an allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the highest at 92.
2. Item 1: Agent 6 values it the highest at 81.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 90.
4. Item 3: Agent 5 values it the highest at 96.
5. Item 4: Agent 5 values it the highest at 97.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the highest at 64.
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values it the highest at 81.
8. Item 7: Agent 7 values it the highest at 93.
9. Item 8: Agent 1 values it the highest at 99.

Now, let's check if any agent has not received any items and adjust if necessary. 

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [5, 8]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [3, 4]
- Agent 6: [1]
- Agent 7: [7]

Now, let's format this into JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3, 4],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and the allocation is based on the highest valuation by each agent for the items they received.
