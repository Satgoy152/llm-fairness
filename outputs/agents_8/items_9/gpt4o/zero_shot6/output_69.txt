Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  75  24  76  16  57  67  58  50
1  96  74  13  77  90  29  77  16   6
2  89  40  77   5  67  27  99  60  54
3  97  76  87  56  89  96  99  58  26
4  33  34  96  70  88   9  90  50  66
5  95  22  52  85  75  66  67  48  76
6  87  78  55  75  54  13  87  46  86
7  82  18  88  74  77  77  11  16  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent is assigned an integer number of items. We'll perform this allocation by analyzing the table to determine which items are most valuable to each agent.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 3, 1, and 6. Allocate item 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value items are 0, 4, and 3. Allocate item 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 6, 0, and 2. Allocate item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value items are 6, 0, and 1. Allocate item 0.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value items are 2, 6, and 4. Allocate item 2.
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value items are 0, 3, and 8. Allocate item 8.
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value items are 0, 1, and 6. Allocate item 1.
8. **Agent 7**: Highest value items are 2, 5, and 4. Allocate item 5.

Now, we have allocated 8 items. We need to allocate one more item to ensure all items are distributed:

9. **Remaining item (7)**: Not yet allocated. Let's allocate it to any agent who would benefit. Agent 3 values item 7 quite highly, so we'll allocate it to them.

Now, we have allocated all 9 items. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is distributed fairly among the agents based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
