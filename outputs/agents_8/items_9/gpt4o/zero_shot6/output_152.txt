Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  16   5  39  34  68  61  22   5
1  88  34  30  20  62  28  31  77  72
2  86  89  87  77  84  50  52  78  60
3  19  78  51  95  92  87  21  30  15
4  75  63  72  43  85  64  32  76  53
5  11  44  83  86  84  98  70  78  64
6   6  13  80  86  58  60  92  77   2
7  63  73  94   3  99   5  61   7  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. One approach to achieving fairness is to prioritize the allocation based on the highest valuations for the items, ensuring that agents receive items they value more highly.

Here is a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 3 values item 3 the most, and the valuation is unique. Allocate item 3 to agent 3.
2. Agent 7 values item 4 the most, and the valuation is unique. Allocate item 4 to agent 7.
3. Agent 5 values item 5 the most, and the valuation is unique. Allocate item 5 to agent 5.
4. Agent 6 values item 6 the most, and the valuation is unique. Allocate item 6 to agent 6.
5. Agent 2 values item 1 the most, and the valuation is unique. Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
6. Agent 0 values item 7 the most, with a valuation of 22, which is higher than any other valuation. Allocate item 7 to agent 0.
7. Agent 1 values item 0 the most, and the valuation is unique. Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
8. Agent 4 values item 8 the most, and the valuation is unique. Allocate item 8 to agent 4.
9. Agent 5 also values item 2 highly, and since they have another item, this balances allocations. Allocate item 2 to agent 5.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [2, 5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are fairly distributed among the agents, with each agent getting items they value highly.
