Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  57   9  73  22  82  22  99  56
1  51  76  48   2  48  71  64  27  98
2  48  90  81  98  19  27  71  63  65
3  49  32  30  47  90  83  68  96  21
4  99   9  96  98  27  41  65   0  12
5  30  60  93  58   8  90  96  43  55
6  72  32  17  94  46  18  57  67  68
7  85  49  16   2  67  18   6  97  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an appropriate number of items, considering their valuations. Given each agent should ideally receive at least one item or a fair share, we need to ensure that all items are allocated and no agent receives more than necessary unless it's unavoidable.

Let's attempt a fair allocation based on the valuations provided:

1. Agent 0: Items [7] (Highest valuation: 99)
2. Agent 1: Items [8] (Highest valuation: 98)
3. Agent 2: Items [3] (Highest valuation: 98)
4. Agent 3: Items [4] (Highest valuation: 90)
5. Agent 4: Items [0] (Highest valuation: 99)
6. Agent 5: Items [5] (Highest valuation: 90)
7. Agent 6: Items [6] (Highest valuation: 57)
8. Agent 7: Items [1, 2] (Highest valuations: 49, 16)

In this allocation, each agent gets at least one item except for Agent 7 who gets two items due to the distribution need. All items are allocated, and the allocation attempts to respect the highest valuations for each agent as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [1, 2]
}
```
