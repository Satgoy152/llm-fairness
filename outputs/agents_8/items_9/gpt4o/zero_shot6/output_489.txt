Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  17  84  91  43  43  61  11  60
1  63  41  47  64  60  82  61  15  11
2  36   1  44  42   9   9  21  34  61
3  51  36  59  72   8   1  56  53  68
4  36  76  98  49  96  78  10  37  38
5  54  37   5  41  92  31  43  68  16
6  21  52  82  95   2  29  16  81   6
7  32  96  85  74  92  68  24   0  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item. However, since there are only 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items. The goal is to distribute these items in a way that maximizes fairness based on the given valuations. Let's approach this allocation by considering the highest valued items for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (91).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5 (82).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 8 (61).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 8, which is also taken. The next highest valuation is item 2 (59).
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 2, but it's already taken. The next highest valuation is item 4 (96).
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 4, but it's already taken. The next highest valuation is item 0 (54).
7. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 3, but it's already taken. The next highest valuation is item 6 (16).
8. Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 7 (0).

One item remains unallocated. Let's allocate this based on the next highest available value:

- Agent 4 has the next highest remaining valuation for item 1 (76).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with agent 4 receiving two items due to their high valuation for both items.
