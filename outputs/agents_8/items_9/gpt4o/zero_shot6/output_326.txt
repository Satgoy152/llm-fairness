Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  80  23  73  34  22  22   7  72
1  57  41  12  99  78  92  50  77  23
2   0  76   5  58  33  25  80   5  60
3  36  24  89  58   2  93  67  85  26
4  29  35  97  32  10  20  48  88  17
5  28  69  58  70  81  87   2  75  44
6  91   4  14   1  39  21  11  81  84
7  36  88  28  90  78  31  55  30  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent gets while ensuring that every item is allocated, and each agent can receive zero or more items. Here's one possible allocation that fairly distributes the items based on the given valuations:

1. Assign Item 1 to Agent 3. (Value = 24)
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 4. (Value = 97)
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1. (Value = 99)
4. Assign Item 4 to Agent 5. (Value = 81)
5. Assign Item 5 to Agent 1. (Value = 92)
6. Assign Item 6 to Agent 2. (Value = 80)
7. Assign Item 7 to Agent 0. (Value = 7)
8. Assign Item 8 to Agent 7. (Value = 90)
9. Assign Item 0 to Agent 6. (Value = 91)

This allocation ensures that each agent has the opportunity to receive items, and we maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [8]
}
```
