Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  30  24  49  41  37  33  91  65
1  17  87  62  14  69  14  29  96  55
2  19  64  94  77  99  45  10  26  49
3  10  77  72  26  36  57  28  60  55
4  16   6  43  40  81  30  90  93  28
5  92  16  93  93  11   1  25  73  82
6  33  87  52  57  51  10  51  47  79
7  85  54  42  35  67  13  13  93  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 8 agents based on the given valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items assigned to them while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive two items.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the item with the highest value for each agent.
2. Assign that item to the corresponding agent.
3. If any items are still unallocated, assign them to the agent with the next highest valuation for those items.

Following this strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (91), so assign item 7 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (87), so assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (99), so assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (77), but it's already taken, so assign item 3 (26) to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most (90), so assign item 6 to agent 4.
- Agent 5 values item 0 the most (92), so assign item 0 to agent 5.
- Agent 6 values item 1 the most (87), but it's already taken, so assign item 8 (79) to agent 6.
- Agent 7 values item 0 the most (85), but it's already taken, so assign item 7 (93) to agent 7.

Revisiting the allocation, we notice that item 2 and item 5 are still unallocated. We can assign these items to agents with the next highest valuation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 7, as Agent 7's second-highest valuation is for item 2 (42).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4, as Agent 4's second-highest valuation is for item 5 (30).

Let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [2]
}
```
