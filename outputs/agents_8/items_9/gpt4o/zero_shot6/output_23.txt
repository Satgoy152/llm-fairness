Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49   3  71  24   3  50  45  68  62
1  10  48  77  48  94  19  33  99  86
2  67  38  23  49  46  74  85  11  91
3  51  59  24  92  84  55  83  69  26
4  50  98  90  72   0  61  69   8   5
5  73  31  43  28  90  72  97  18  49
6   5  29  90  73   2  61  31  24  16
7  27  83  49  15  27  38   7  25  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. Given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, most agents will get one item, and one agent will get two items. We'll maximize the total valuation each agent receives as a guide for this allocation.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 2 (Value: 71)
2. Agent 1: Item 7 (Value: 99)
3. Agent 2: Item 8 (Value: 91)
4. Agent 3: Item 3 (Value: 92)
5. Agent 4: Item 1 (Value: 98)
6. Agent 5: Item 6 (Value: 97)
7. Agent 6: Item 5 (Value: 61)
8. Agent 7: Item 4 (Value: 27) and Item 0 (Value: 27)

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, maximizes individual valuations where possible, and allocates exactly 9 items in total.
