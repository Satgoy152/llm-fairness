Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  54   5   0  36  72  48  75  53
1  88  97  94  12  92  62  18  77  86
2  76  77  80  64  53  39  16  15  87
3   1   3  18  88  87   3  90  95  92
4  85  51  96  31  40   1  39  79  58
5  51  31  77  23  55   9  98  88  78
6  38  52  46   5  46  32  28  60  40
7  40  55  18  90  46  66  81  63   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, one approach is to consider each agent's valuation for the items and aim to distribute the items such that the overall value received by each agent is somewhat balanced. Given that we have 9 items and 8 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but the goal is to ensure no agent feels significantly disadvantaged.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are highest for items 5, 7, and 0. Allocate item 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are highest for items 1, 2, and 4. Allocate item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are highest for items 2, 8, and 1. Allocate item 8.
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are highest for items 7, 8, and 4. Allocate item 7.
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are highest for items 2, 0, and 7. Allocate item 2.
6. **Agent 5**: Valuations are highest for items 6, 8, and 7. Allocate item 6.
7. **Agent 6**: Valuations are highest for items 1, 8, and 4. Allocate item 4.
8. **Agent 7**: Valuations are highest for items 3, 5, and 6. Allocate item 3.

In this allocation, each agent receives one item, except for Agent 0, who receives item 0 (since there are more agents than items).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [3]
}
```
