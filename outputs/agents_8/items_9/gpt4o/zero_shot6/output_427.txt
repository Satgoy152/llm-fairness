Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  55  64  80  84  10  22  48  11
1  87  62  82  55  79  50  54  48  37
2  59  30  49  43  62  68  34  74  73
3  55  14  91  76  88  62   3  24   5
4  22  34  47  47  61  93   2  14   3
5  29  67  12  25  34  87  97  34  21
6  11  83  12  12  40   2  45  58  81
7  12  28  11  57  38  45  34  19  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their satisfaction, we can use a simple greedy method by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how you can approach this:

1. Go through each item and find out which agent values it the most.
2. Assign that item to the agent.
3. Ensure every item is allocated and no agent gets more items than another unless necessary due to the total number of items.

Let's perform this allocation based on our approach:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 1 (87).
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 6 (83).
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 3 (91).
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 0 (80).
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 3 (88).
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 4 (93).
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 5 (97).
- Item 7 is valued highest by Agent 2 (74).
- Item 8 is valued highest by Agent 7 (93).

Now let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and all 9 items are distributed among the 8 agents.
