Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  66  72  23  69  75  53  87  77
1  58  29  91  28  52  60  82  48  11
2  46  95  10  99  29  23  30  91  89
3  11  17  88  41  28  88   0  39   5
4   0  68  78  39  52  15   2  88  57
5  16  51  86  96  29  84  24  57  29
6  38  18   4  51  16   3  52  56  27
7  67  17  17  91  27  49  14  84  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. One common approach is to assign items based on the highest value an agent assigns to them, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 2 since they value it the highest (99).
2. Assign item 7 to agent 0 since they value it the highest (87).
3. Assign item 6 to agent 1 since they value it the highest (82).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 2 since they value it the highest (95).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0 since they value it the highest (69).
6. Assign item 8 to agent 7 since they value it the highest (95).
7. Assign item 5 to agent 5 since they value it the highest (84).
8. Assign item 2 to agent 0 since they value it the highest (72).
9. Assign item 0 to agent 7 since they value it the highest (67).

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, with each agent receiving an integer number of items:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [],
    "7": [8, 0]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 7, 4, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives item 6.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 1.
- Agent 3 receives no items.
- Agent 4 receives no items.
- Agent 5 receives item 5.
- Agent 6 receives no items.
- Agent 7 receives items 8 and 0.

This allocation is balanced in terms of maximizing the total value received by each agent based on their preferences.
