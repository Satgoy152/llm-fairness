Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  62  77  55  51  10  15  38  46
1  53  24  76  80  88  72  44  39  89
2  77  41   8  51  75  24  17  96   7
3  79  17  20  17  91  15  61  90  42
4  79  81  16  70  35   8  51  31  91
5  86  21  30  21  14  23  25  40  36
6  45  55  93  55  82   7  74  45  20
7  79  13   8  88  97  16  10  52  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, at least one agent will receive more than one item. Below is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 0 (Value 82).
2. Agent 1 receives item 8 (Value 89).
3. Agent 2 receives item 7 (Value 96).
4. Agent 3 receives item 4 (Value 91).
5. Agent 4 receives item 1 (Value 81).
6. Agent 5 receives item 5 (Value 23).
7. Agent 6 receives item 2 (Value 93).
8. Agent 7 receives items 3 and 6 (Values 88 and 10).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, while maximizing their individual valuations as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 8 agents, ensuring a fair and integer allocation.
