Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  59  21  34  30   2  96  30  20
1  40  44  18  14  98  41  53  79  13
2   1  10  84  14  35  87  20  22  19
3  96  69  76  15  42  41  22  74  75
4  17  46  38  39  73  25  19  27  53
5  74  74  94  81  57  10  73  91  45
6  60  47  19  72  14  46  13  17  67
7  15  84  27  31  81  98  75  46  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes the total value obtained by all agents or ensures that each agent gets roughly an equal share in terms of their valuations.

Let's analyze the table and proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Review the highest valuations for each item and try to allocate items to agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, but since there are 9 items and 8 agents, at least one agent will get more than one item.

Here's a possible allocation plan:

- Assign item 0 to agent 3, who values it at 96, the highest.
- Assign item 1 to agent 7, who values it at 84, the highest.
- Assign item 2 to agent 5, who values it at 94, the highest.
- Assign item 3 to agent 6, who values it at 72, the highest.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1, who values it at 98, the highest.
- Assign item 5 to agent 7, who values it at 98, the highest.
- Assign item 6 to agent 0, who values it at 96, the highest.
- Assign item 7 to agent 5, who values it at 91, the highest.
- Assign item 8 to agent 6, who values it at 67, the highest.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [2, 7],
    "6": [3, 8],
    "7": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring a fair distribution based on the provided valuations.
