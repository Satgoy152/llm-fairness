Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  89  78  82  78  44  51  96  39
1  49  97  12  16  58  40  97  85  94
2  78  74  30  63  54   4  59  64  49
3  46  36   6  88  51  80  98  85  52
4  75  32  35  48  96  48  74  13  31
5  71   1  49   6  99  88  33  12   1
6  26  31   2  99  19  79  72  47  63
7   6  74  25  61  79  27   1  28  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. We can try to maximize the overall satisfaction across agents by considering their highest value items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning each agent their highest valued item that hasn't been assigned yet.
2. Continue assigning the next highest valued item for each agent until all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation based on the given table:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest at 96.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 97.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 78.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest at 98.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest at 96.
- Agent 5 values item 5 the highest at 88.
- Agent 6 values item 3 the highest at 99.
- Agent 7 doesn't have any very high-value preferences after the above allocations, so we'll allocate the remaining items based on the next best available options.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [2, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
