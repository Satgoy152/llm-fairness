Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  76  49  66  56   5  95  42  82
1  89  81  40  32   9  28  52   3  68
2  61   9  41  73  99   4  90  61  83
3  50  87   9  32  71  82  27  38   7
4  85  21  55  42  37  71   0  58  86
5  94  19  46  30  30  60  76  47  83
6  58  62  30  60  94   5  49  33  92
7  41  50  78  54   7  44  10  88  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we need to approach the problem with fairness in mind. One way to do this is to try to maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** First, let's look for the highest valuations to prioritize initial allocations. This helps in ensuring that agents get items they value the most.

2. **Distribute Items:** Allocate items one by one to agents based on their highest value for an unallocated item.

3. **Ensure Total Allocation:** Make sure all 9 items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

4. **Reallocate if Necessary:** If an agent ends up with no items, check if it's possible to reallocate to optimize the distribution.

Here's a fair allocation based on the above principles:

- Agent 0: Receives item 6 (valued at 95).
- Agent 1: Receives item 0 (valued at 89).
- Agent 2: Receives item 4 (valued at 99).
- Agent 3: Receives item 1 (valued at 87).
- Agent 4: Receives item 8 (valued at 86).
- Agent 5: Receives item 2 (valued at 46).
- Agent 6: Receives item 3 (valued at 60).
- Agent 7: Receives item 7 (valued at 88).

Now, we ensure all items are distributed:

- Remaining item 5: Assign to the agent with the next highest value who hasn't received an item yet. In this case, Agent 3 could receive item 5 (valued at 82), increasing their total allocation.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are distributed, and the distribution is as fair as possible based on the given valuations.
