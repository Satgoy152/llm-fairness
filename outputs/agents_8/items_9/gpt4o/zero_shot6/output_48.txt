Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  79  37   8  11  22  27  62  79
1  43  64  88  43  10  18  48  76  84
2  98  75  89  86  71  22  18  83  14
3  44  19  47  69  29  76  62  31  32
4   6  11  85  41  28  94  18  39   5
5  25   2  82  26  27  61  41  80  71
6  29  90   5  64  75  49  41  26   9
7  75  99  87  19  89  14  70  95  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. One strategy is to try to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's start by evaluating the highest values and trying to distribute them evenly among agents:

1. Agent 2 highly values item 0 with a value of 98.
2. Agent 7 highly values item 1 with a value of 99.
3. Agent 2 also highly values item 2 with a value of 89.
4. Agent 7 highly values item 7 with a value of 95.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 5 with a value of 94.
6. Agent 1 highly values item 8 with a value of 84.
7. Agent 6 highly values item 4 with a value of 75.
8. Agent 3 highly values item 3 with a value of 69.
9. Agent 5 highly values item 6 with a value of 41.

The allocations will be distributed as follows:

- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [8]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [5]
- Agent 5: [6]
- Agent 6: [4]
- Agent 7: [1, 7]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [1, 7]
}
```
