Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  28   9  88  89   0  64  49  36
1  50  21  78  55   9  73  41  68  58
2  20  48  67  27  91  65  81  74  92
3  65  37  89  91  49  43  18  88  17
4  50  67  12  62  44  48  58  26  90
5  85  20  84  14  82  70  56  45  73
6  66  81  61  25   3  93  29  55  34
7  57  67  80  72  95  87  32  29  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we can use a method that attempts to balance the total valuations of items each agent receives. This will involve considering each agent's valuations and distributing the items to maximize fairness.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and attempt to distribute items such that each agent gets a reasonable share of high-value items based on their preferences.

2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

After analyzing the valuations, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [2]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 8]
- Agent 3: Items [1]
- Agent 4: Items [6]
- Agent 5: Items [5]
- Agent 6: Items [7]
- Agent 7: Items []

This allocation considers each agent's high-value items while ensuring all items are distributed fairly among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [7],
    "7": []
}
```
