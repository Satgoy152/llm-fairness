Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  42  94  67  46  11  50  77  20
1  82  46  51  65  56  63  13  58  56
2  76  25  85  17  63   2  13  13  27
3  15  34  10   8  92  75  80  26  36
4   1  21  80  77   8  64  34  23   7
5  75  88  90  70  27  17  73  97   9
6  39  57   7  20  70  27  97  52  42
7  59  28  61  22  84  53   0  64  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that reasonably balances the total value each agent receives, based on their individual valuations. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: First, we calculate the total value each agent would receive if they were assigned an item.

2. **Assign Items**: We assign items to agents by trying to maximize the individual agent's value for the assigned items. This can be done by iterating over the items and assigning them to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and that the total number of allocated items is 9.

Let's proceed with this approach:

### Allocation Strategy
- Allocate items based on who values them the most, while ensuring fairness by considering the overall distribution of total value among agents.

### Calculated Allocation
- Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while making sure no agent receives more than the necessary items to reach a total of 9 items.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5, 7],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items, while trying to maximize the value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.
