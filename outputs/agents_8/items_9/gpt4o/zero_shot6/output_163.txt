Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  34  19  43  37  22  77  67  20
1  77  25  49  44   8  29  96  15  30
2  88  12  26  33  91  89  76  74  81
3  78  98  36  49  14   8  72  29  99
4  64  69  21  41  12  70  61  62   7
5  22  35  43  17  43   7  34   3   7
6  12  73  46  69  80  60   1  58   6
7  81  48  70  63  79  73  15  94  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that exactly 9 items are allocated in total. Given that there are more agents than items, some agents will inevitably not receive any items. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and allocate that item to the corresponding agent. If there is a tie, we can break it arbitrarily.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (value 88).
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (value 98).
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 7 (value 70).
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 6 (value 69).
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (value 91).
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (value 89).
- Item 6: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (value 96).
- Item 7: Highest valuation is by Agent 7 (value 94).
- Item 8: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (value 99).

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it most, and each agent receives at least 0 and at most 2 items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [2, 7]
}
```
