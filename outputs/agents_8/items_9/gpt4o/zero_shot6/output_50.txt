Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  82   4  65   1  74  49  83   2
1   2  29  57  87  79  16  95   2  72
2  24  53  87  59  81  85  21  62   9
3   8  28  30  83   9  37  21  35  83
4  68  17  14   0   1   8  66  60  71
5  11  65  34  77  39  25  92  99  16
6  97  51  13  50  17  75  52  83  85
7  40  88  24   6  22  57  30  80  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents who value them the most. We will allocate one item at a time by selecting the agent who has the highest value for an item that has not been allocated yet. 

Here's how the allocations would look:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 6 values it the highest at 97.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 7 values it the highest at 88.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 87.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 87.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 81.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 85.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 95.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 5 values it the highest at 99.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 7 values it the highest at 98.

Now, we can allocate as follows, making sure each agent gets an integer number of items:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [1, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated, with some agents receiving multiple items based on their valuations.
