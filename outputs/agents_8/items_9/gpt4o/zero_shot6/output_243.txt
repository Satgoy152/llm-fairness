Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  63  58  84  22  57  14  85  78
1  49  45  23  54  54  98   6  91  82
2  84   8  79  77  55  43  99  61  63
3  33  16  52  97  43  46  14  96  66
4  33  76  81  57  18  83  69  46  10
5  87  50  29  85  78  27  70  94   8
6   2  88  65  77   2  34  17  38  74
7   0   6  77  21  65  29  84  33  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. However, we must also consider distributing items to ensure a fair allocation across agents. Here's one way to do it:

1. Calculate the total valuations for each item across all agents and allocate items to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring that every agent receives items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Following these principles, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 3, 7
- Agent 1 gets items: 5
- Agent 2 gets items: 6
- Agent 3 gets items: 2
- Agent 4 gets items: 1
- Agent 5 gets items: 0
- Agent 6 gets items: 8
- Agent 7 gets items: 4

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [4]
}
```
