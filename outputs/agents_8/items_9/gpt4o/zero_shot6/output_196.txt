Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  15  31  92  56  66  69  12  33
1  58  81  29  12  57   7  45  78  43
2  79   7  54  80  66  43  82  58  37
3  41  36  69  36  82   2  29  79  64
4  69  24   4  46   1  94  96  91  97
5   7  12  14   6  96  69  59  59  99
6  27  43  31  36  13  41  50  89  65
7  31  46  98  16  78  47  79  67  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent must receive 2 items while the others receive 1 item each. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Attempt to allocate items to balance these total values as evenly as possible.

Let's perform this allocation:

- Agent 0: Choose the item with the highest value for Agent 0, which is item 3 (value 92).
- Agent 1: Choose item 1 (value 81) for Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Choose item 6 (value 82) for Agent 2.
- Agent 3: Choose item 4 (value 82) for Agent 3.
- Agent 4: Choose item 8 (value 97) for Agent 4.
- Agent 5: Choose item 5 (value 69) for Agent 5.
- Agent 6: Choose item 7 (value 89) for Agent 6.
- Agent 7: Choose item 2 (value 98) for Agent 7.
- Agent 0 again: Since one agent needs to receive 2 items, and Agent 0 has the next highest value available for item 0 (value 44), assign item 0 to Agent 0 as well.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives as fairly as possible while ensuring every item is allocated.
