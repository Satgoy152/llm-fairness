Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  36  36  41  76  50  25  77  24
1  32  68  32  75  16  77  81  88  63
2  84  44  57  88  52  46  20  48  41
3  67  18  43   5   4  63  24  56  81
4  38  95  74  59  28  38  31  85  87
5   8  71  31  13  79  50  20  30  31
6  30   5  90  88  41  62  37  18  70
7  66   4  18  87  88  98  79  28  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each. 

Let's consider the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 0 with a value of 88.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 7 with a value of 88.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 3 with a value of 88.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 8 with a value of 81.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 1 with a value of 95.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation for Agent 5 is item 4 with a value of 79.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest valuation for Agent 6 is item 2 with a value of 90.
8. **Agent 7**: The highest valuation for Agent 7 is item 5 with a value of 98.

Now, all agents have one item each. We still have item 6 left to allocate. 

Agent 1 has the next highest valuation for item 6 with a value of 81, followed by Agent 7 with a valuation of 79. However, Agent 1 already has a high valuation item (item 7), and Agent 7 has the highest remaining value for item 5. Allocating item 6 to Agent 7 will increase their total valuation without giving any agent two high-value items.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [5, 6]
}
```
