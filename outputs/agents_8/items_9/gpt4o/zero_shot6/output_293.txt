Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  10  65  32  28  28  60  47  93
1  92  63  27   6  47  46  16  40  32
2  25   0  93  78   8  27  99   2  37
3  90  23  18  90  87  94  48  64  36
4  88  83  65  89   3  33  33  13  99
5  48  93  78  53  90  52  57  19  10
6  55  36  38  80  69  84  44  91  71
7  60  55   9  11  29  88  75  48  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation of the items by all agents. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, each agent should ideally get at least one item, with one agent getting two items. 

Hereâ€™s a potential allocation that balances the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (value 65)
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 (value 92)
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 (value 99)
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 5 (value 94)
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 8 (value 99)
6. **Agent 5**: Assign item 1 (value 93)
7. **Agent 6**: Assign item 3 (value 80)
8. **Agent 7**: Assign items 4 and 7 (values 29 and 48)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item, with Agent 7 receiving two items to account for all 9 items. The allocation aims to maximize the overall valuation by assigning the highest valued items to the respective agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [4, 7]
}
```
