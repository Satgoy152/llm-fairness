Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  73  62  95  23  72  59  51  16
1  34  55  55  69  19  83  60  82  47
2   3  89  83  77  83  30   4  52  41
3  11  35  60  31  76  40   9  26  38
4  44  78  13  95  81   5  72  87  21
5  56  79  15  87  30  91   8   7  17
6  50  19  67  46  19  16  63  29  88
7  51  19  95  30  49   4  98  90   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. I'll use a straightforward approach to allocate items by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Here's the allocation process:

1. Item 0: The highest value is 56 by agent 5.
2. Item 1: The highest value is 89 by agent 2.
3. Item 2: The highest value is 95 by agent 7.
4. Item 3: There are two highest values of 95 by agents 0 and 4. We'll assign it to agent 0.
5. Item 4: The highest value is 83 by agent 2.
6. Item 5: The highest value is 91 by agent 5.
7. Item 6: The highest value is 98 by agent 7.
8. Item 7: The highest value is 90 by agent 7.
9. Item 8: The highest value is 88 by agent 6.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0, 5],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, with each item going to the agent who values it the most, and agents are included even if they receive no items.
