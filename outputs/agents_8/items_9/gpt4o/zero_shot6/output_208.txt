Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42   1  23  58  54  80  80  66  21
1   8  76   5  83  63  52  13  80  50
2  17  79  79  15  90  15   8  35   5
3  75  40  50  91  18  91  57  59  32
4   7  40  45  45  73  16  13  72  23
5  92  96  58  33  92  96  68  93  69
6  13  27  70  78  91  60  84  72  71
7  34  17  70   6  38  65  70  38  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations**: 
   - Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 1 (96) and item 5 (96).
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 (91).
   - Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 4 (91).
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (90).
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (80).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (83).
   - Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 8 (88).
   - Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 4 (73).

2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed**: 
   - After assigning based on highest valuations, some items may remain unallocated if they are not the highest for any agent. Check those items and ensure they are also distributed fairly. Adjust allocations to ensure every item is assigned.

3. **Final allocation after adjustments**:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items, considering their preferences and the overall distribution of items. If necessary, adjustments can be made to further optimize based on specific criteria or constraints.
