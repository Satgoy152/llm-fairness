Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  25  42  88  41  83  99  56  58
1  27  61   7  17  72  90  73  74  16
2  13  72  46  43  31  48  53  46  71
3  20  24  82  78  36  70  25  40  90
4  83   9  85  12  90  67  65  14  13
5  70  42  34  91  74  63  95  61  24
6  11   5  93  55  40   6  70  73  19
7  24  12  33  35  15  88  43  77  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations given in the table. With 8 agents and 9 items, each agent should receive at least one item, and one agent will receive two items. A common approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the satisfaction or valuation for the items assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent gets an item.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Applying this strategy, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 6 (99)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (90)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (72)
- Agent 3: Item 8 (90)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (90)
- Agent 5: Item 3 (91)
- Agent 6: Item 2 (93)
- Agent 7: Items 7 (77) and 0 (24)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Now, here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [7, 0]
}
```
