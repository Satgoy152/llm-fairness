Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  29  35   9  28  59  15  64  48
1  65  18  87  51  17   3  30  55   5
2  75  48  52  32  54  55  89   9  49
3  26  92  81  14   5  44  34  84  35
4  59  90  66   5  91  62  86  40  68
5  97  22   1  90  69  52  35  46   3
6  61   5  11  96  44  68  95  98   4
7  32  33  53   1  74  88  64  82   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and ensure that each agent receives at least one item. There are 8 agents and 9 items, so one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each.

Given the valuations, we can prioritize assigning each agent an item they value highly. Let's go through the allocation step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 is valued the highest at 97.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 2 is valued the highest at 87.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 6 is valued the highest at 89.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 1 is valued the highest at 92.
5. **Agent 4**: Item 4 is valued the highest at 91.
6. **Agent 5**: Item 3 is valued the highest at 90.
7. **Agent 6**: Item 7 is valued the highest at 98.
8. **Agent 7**: Item 5 is valued the highest at 88.

Now, each agent has been allocated one item, and we have allocated 8 items so far. We have one more item (Item 8) to allocate. To decide who should get the extra item, we can look at who values the remaining item the most:

- Agent 0: 48
- Agent 1: 5
- Agent 2: 49
- Agent 3: 35
- Agent 4: 68
- Agent 5: 3
- Agent 6: 4
- Agent 7: 7

Agent 4 values Item 8 the highest at 68. Thus, Agent 4 will receive a second item.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 8],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [5]
}
```
