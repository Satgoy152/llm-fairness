Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38   4  18  80  98  28  63  72  39
1  52   2  56  89  29  23  10  90  16
2  78  84  59  87  82  32  73  49  74
3  16  20  68  43  39  66  47  73  44
4  10  87  76  21  15  53  63  24  35
5  74  68  12  69  65  66  51  37   0
6   2  27  23  26  82  24  11  69  79
7  28  30  56  45  48   2  23  69   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and that exactly 9 items are allocated in total. Here is one possible way to allocate the items based on maximizing the valuations for each agent as much as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the values, agent 0 highly values item 4 (98) and item 3 (80). Allocating these items to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 (89) and item 7 (90) highly. However, item 3 is already allocated to agent 0, so we allocate item 7 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has high valuations for item 1 (84) and item 3 (87), but item 3 is already taken. We allocate item 1 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3's highest value is for item 7 (73), but it's taken by agent 1. The next highest value is item 6 (47), which we can allocate to them.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 1 (87) and item 2 (76) highly. Item 1 is taken, so we allocate item 2 to agent 4.

6. **Agent 5**: Agent 5 values item 0 (74) highly, so we allocate item 0 to them.

7. **Agent 6**: Agent 6's highest value is for item 8 (79), which is available, so we allocate it to agent 6.

8. **Agent 7**: Agent 7 values item 3 (45) highly, but it is taken. We can allocate them item 5 (2), which is one of the remaining items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item where possible, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [5]
}
```
