Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  90  13  86  58   1  13  51  36
1   8  50  75  35   2  95  12  43  27
2  36  73  66   7  47  79  19  47  78
3  58  64  63  60  45  22  61  54  52
4  85  31  39  20  58  82  81  80   5
5  74  15  32  11  37  20   0   1  41
6  40  61  48  49   8  18   6  33  26
7  43   0  92  43   3  13  98  49  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation should be based on their valuations to some extent. We will aim to distribute the items such that the sum of the values for each agent is maximized under these constraints.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Consider the highest-valued items by each agent and assign those items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Distribute the items ensuring that each agent gets at least one item while trying not to leave any agent with no items if possible.

Following this approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly, so we give item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 highly, so we give item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 8 highly, so we give item 8 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly, so we give item 2 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 highly, so we give item 0 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 4 highly, so we give item 4 to Agent 5.
7. Agent 6 values item 3 highly, so we give item 3 to Agent 6.
8. Agent 7 values item 6 highly, so we give item 6 to Agent 7.

Finally, we have 9 items, and we need to allocate the final item. Let's distribute item 7 to a suitable agent to balance the allocation. Agent 4 values item 7 highly, so we give item 7 to Agent 4.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
