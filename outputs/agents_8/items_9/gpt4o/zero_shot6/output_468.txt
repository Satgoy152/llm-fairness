Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  83  94   3  23  21   3  31  56
1  61   8   8  45  41  82  70  12   4
2  76  38   5  62  53  77  79  18  47
3  86  51  71  42   9  78  35  88  61
4  76  57  64  12  24  26  76  29  73
5  49  93  13  76  15  61  21   4  88
6  36  35  19  57   9  25  30  63  74
7  28  80  11  11  51  25  95  25   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's total value, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Adjust allocations if any agent receives no items, to maintain fairness.

Let's analyze the table and determine the best allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value by agent 3 (86)
- Item 1: Highest value by agent 5 (93)
- Item 2: Highest value by agent 0 (94)
- Item 3: Highest value by agent 5 (76)
- Item 4: Highest value by agent 7 (51)
- Item 5: Highest value by agent 1 (82)
- Item 6: Highest value by agent 7 (95)
- Item 7: Highest value by agent 3 (88)
- Item 8: Highest value by agent 5 (88)

Let's allocate these items based on the highest values:

- Agent 0 gets item [2]
- Agent 1 gets item [5]
- Agent 2 gets no items []
- Agent 3 gets items [0, 7]
- Agent 4 gets no items []
- Agent 5 gets items [1, 3, 8]
- Agent 6 gets no items []
- Agent 7 gets items [4, 6]

This distribution ensures all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [],
    "5": [1, 3, 8],
    "6": [],
    "7": [4, 6]
}
```
