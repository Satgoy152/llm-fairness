Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  93  87  33  96  90  27  85  89
1  83   0  93  11  45  98  30  87  64
2  19  14  61  15  70  13  39   6  44
3  71  17  20   7  20  91  38   8  99
4  42  18  41  79  50  86  52  81  81
5  88  18  21  67  12  94  11  43  35
6  47  38   2   8  12  79  86  98  41
7  64  54  65  55  30  48  19  31  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate 9 items to 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the sum of all allocated items equals 9. We can use a simple heuristic approach to ensure fairness.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, but since we have 8 agents and 9 items, at least one agent will get 2 items.

Let's consider the highest valuations for each item and allocate accordingly:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 5 (88)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (93)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (93)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 4 (79)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (96)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 1 (98)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 6 (86)
- Item 7: Highest value by Agent 6 (98)
- Item 8: Highest value by Agent 3 (99)

Now let's assign them to ensure each agent gets at least one item where possible:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [No items]
- Agent 3: Items [8]
- Agent 4: Items [3]
- Agent 5: Items [0]
- Agent 6: Items [6, 7]
- Agent 7: [No items]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6, 7],
    "7": []
}
```
