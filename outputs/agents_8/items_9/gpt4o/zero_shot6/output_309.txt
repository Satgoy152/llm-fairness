Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3   0   4  95  95  17  25  33  53
1  32   6  44  76  38  28  19  60  12
2  87  56  62  81  80  45  39  96  86
3   1   0   0  26  52  32  72  20  72
4  96  35  19  29  64  23  86  17  17
5  79  24  97  28  39  47   0  75  85
6  48  53  63  94  62  84  83  74  30
7  69  64  89  55  90  46  59  12  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can aim to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations, attempting to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given the constraints, the allocation process needs to ensure that all 9 items are allocated.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 3, 4 (High valuation for these items)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 2 (Moderate valuation)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 7 (Highest valuation for this item)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 6 (High valuation)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 0 (Highest valuation)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 8 (High valuation)
7. **Agent 6**: Item 5 (High valuation)
8. **Agent 7**: Item 1 (High valuation)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the value for each agent based on their provided valuations.
