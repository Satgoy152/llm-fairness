Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  71  52  76  64  51  59   3  72
1   3  79  12  79  64   1  74  76  63
2  37  83  95  39  75  46  30  52  47
3  92  86  79   2   7  95  74  57   4
4  97  48  60  43  57  72  39  16  34
5   7  64  84  61  58  36  66  62  36
6  80  95  35  75  97  28  41   2  35
7  51  25  30  88  28  68  14  83  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. One approach is to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction or to simply ensure each agent gets at least one item fairly. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items, while the rest receive one.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each agent and allocate that item to the agent, ensuring each item is only given once.
2. Assign the remaining items in a way that complements the initial distribution, keeping the allocation fair.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 could get item 3 (value 76).
- Agent 1 could get item 1 (value 79).
- Agent 2 could get item 2 (value 95).
- Agent 3 could get item 5 (value 95).
- Agent 4 could get item 0 (value 97).
- Agent 5 could get item 8 (value 36).
- Agent 6 could get item 4 (value 97).
- Agent 7 could get items 6 and 7 (values 14 and 83, respectively).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [6, 7]
}
```
