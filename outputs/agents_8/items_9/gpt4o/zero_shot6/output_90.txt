Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  66  43  58  61  52  71  10  81
1  22  81  59  82  39  37  25  93  87
2  86  64  66  74  74  55  50  56  97
3   5  17  18  49  94  64  99  58  57
4  65  83  30  99  26  66   8   0  27
5  28  68  38  50  77  36  55  41  45
6  62   0  57  55  63  33  58  78  14
7  55  53  53  48  77  55  29  60   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate 9 items to 8 agents, we can follow a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 8 with a value of 81.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 7 with a value of 93.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 8, but it's already allocated, so we pick item 0 with a value of 86.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 6 with a value of 99.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 3 with a value of 99.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value for Agent 5 is item 4 with a value of 77.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest value for Agent 6 is item 7, but it's already allocated, so we pick item 6 with a value of 58.
8. **Agent 7**: The highest value for Agent 7 is item 4, but it's already allocated, so we pick item 1 with a value of 53.

Now we have allocated 8 items, and one item remains. We will assign this last item to an agent with the least allocation, while trying to maximize the agent's value from the remaining items.

9. **Remaining Item (Item 5)**: This item is best valued by Agent 3 (64), but since Agent 3 already received a high value item, let's allocate it to another agent. Agent 5 values it at 36, and Agent 6 values it at 33. We allocate item 5 to Agent 5.

Our final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4, 5],
    "6": [],
    "7": [1]
}
```
