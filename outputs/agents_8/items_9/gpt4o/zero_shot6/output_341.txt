Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  38  39  78   4   0  22  79   4
1  15  24  52  39  79  17  96  95  37
2  74  63  88  67  64  20  20  28  71
3  80  76  92  44  21  13  65  75  50
4  14  15  74  91  48  92  62  54  74
5  40   3  90  11  48  13  46  53  24
6  17  42  40  10  22  27  32   4  67
7  77  87  95  48  77  26  31  51  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider how to distribute them such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items is 9. This can be approached by evaluating the valuations and attempting to distribute the items to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Allocate item 3 to agent 0. (Value of 78)
2. Allocate item 6 to agent 1. (Value of 96)
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 2. (Value of 88)
4. Allocate item 0 to agent 3. (Value of 80)
5. Allocate item 5 to agent 4. (Value of 92)
6. Allocate item 8 to agent 5. (Value of 24)
7. Allocate item 1 to agent 7. (Value of 87)
8. Allocate item 7 to agent 4. (Value of 54)
9. Allocate item 4 to agent 1. (Value of 79)

This allocation is made to maximize the values for the agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one or no items. Here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 7],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [],
    "7": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
