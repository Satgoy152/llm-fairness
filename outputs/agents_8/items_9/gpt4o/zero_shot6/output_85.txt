Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  86  39  66  33   6  35  34  83
1  71  33  41  53  69  24  50  66  26
2  80  52  27  67  55  49  26  26  86
3  49   7  34  63  77   5  45  53  61
4   9  53  76  76  50  18  94  40  36
5  16  53  12  80  53  64  64  37  86
6   3   1  80  44   2  62  39  60  44
7  48  34  77  74  13  73  33   6  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can consider giving each agent at least one item, ensuring that all 9 items are allocated. Since there are more items than agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each.

Here is a possible allocation based on the given data:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 86)
- Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 53)
- Agent 2 gets item 8 (value 86)
- Agent 3 gets item 4 (value 77)
- Agent 4 gets item 6 (value 94)
- Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 64)
- Agent 6 gets item 2 (value 80)
- Agent 7 gets item 7 (value 6) and item 0 (value 48)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item, and one agent receives two items, while all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [7, 0]
}
```
