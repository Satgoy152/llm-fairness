Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  75  53  24  93  87  14  43  52
1  62  80  29  92  81  82  65   3  93
2  93  41  77  35  86  86  16  85   1
3  64   2  10  52  69  59  18  31  62
4  76  55  84  71  10  72  61  61  97
5  91  76  90  70  99  75  93  25  38
6  32  76  51  50  84  75  29   9  93
7   4  10   6  91  52  59  11  18  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total allocation sums to 9. Here is one possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, or otherwise distribute the items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Assign to agent 2 (value 93)
- Item 1: Assign to agent 1 (value 80)
- Item 2: Assign to agent 5 (value 90)
- Item 3: Assign to agent 1 (value 92)
- Item 4: Assign to agent 5 (value 99)
- Item 5: Assign to agent 0 (value 87)
- Item 6: Assign to agent 5 (value 93)
- Item 7: Assign to agent 2 (value 85)
- Item 8: Assign to agent 4 (value 97)

Now, let's ensure each agent is accounted for in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [2, 4, 6],
    "6": [],
    "7": []
}
```

This allocation fairly distributes the items while considering agents' preferences and ensuring all items are allocated.
