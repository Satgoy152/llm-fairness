Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  99  94  81  49  44  19  21   1
1  96  49  91  64  76  49   1  87   4
2  75  41  67  20  46  44  20  67  15
3  93  46  22  27  65  42  27  20  11
4  63   2  67  51  27  14   4  39  24
5  65  75  47  57  69  67  88  89  49
6  73  54  69   0  40  56  43  71  78
7  72  54   3  31  54  77  11  70  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to maximize the total valuation for the agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no items are left unallocated. Given the data provided, we can use a greedy method to allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure that every agent gets at least one item. If not, reallocate items from agents with multiple items to those with none while trying to minimize the loss in total valuation.

Here's a solution for the given problem:

- Item 0 is most valued by agent 1 (96).
- Item 1 is most valued by agent 0 (99).
- Item 2 is most valued by agent 0 (94).
- Item 3 is most valued by agent 0 (81).
- Item 4 is most valued by agent 5 (69).
- Item 5 is most valued by agent 7 (77).
- Item 6 is most valued by agent 5 (88).
- Item 7 is most valued by agent 5 (89).
- Item 8 is most valued by agent 6 (78).

This initial allocation gives us:

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: []
- Agent 5: [4, 6, 7]
- Agent 6: [8]
- Agent 7: [5]

Now, let's adjust to ensure every agent gets at least one item:

- Assign Item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 6 from Agent 5 to Agent 4.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4, 7],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all agents receive at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.
