Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  17  17  87  93  72  86  64  83
1  20  13  85   7  16  47  62   8  62
2  38   5  80  24  99  80  66  48  74
3  55  45  99  36  42  82  80  64  14
4   5  26  73  15  32  86   4  23  28
5  16  98  33  32  70  70  37  44  14
6  37  94  30   0   9  69  60  22  29
7  49  65  57   1  18   2  22  27   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. We can aim for a balanced distribution based on the provided valuations, ensuring each agent receives items that they value highly while taking into account the overall fairness of the distribution. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 highly.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 highly.
7. Agent 6 values item 1 highly.
8. Agent 7 does not have particularly high valuations, so we assign any leftover items.

After considering these observations, here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.
