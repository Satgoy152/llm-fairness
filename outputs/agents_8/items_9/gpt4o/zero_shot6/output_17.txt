Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60   3  64  87  81  73  45  84   0
1  95  81  56  88  39  76  25  66  10
2  54  31   6  67  29   6  39  74  53
3  95  84  55  81   2  67  46  31  24
4  54  71  17  12  32  95  72  91  31
5  35  70  39  57  68   9  80  96  68
6  45  49  92  41  22  39  57  19  97
7  45  57   9  96  69  82  78  18  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a manner that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Here's a suggested allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Distribute remaining items to maximize total valuation.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (87).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (95).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 8 (53).
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 0, but since it's already taken, we check other high valuations: they get item 1 (84).
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 5 (95).
6. **Agent 5** has the highest valuation for item 7 (96).
7. **Agent 6** has the highest valuation for item 2 (92).
8. **Agent 7** has the highest valuation for item 3, but since it's already taken, they get item 6 (78).

Now, let's assign the remaining item:

- Item 4 is unassigned. Agent 0 and Agent 7 have high valuations for it. Assign item 4 to **Agent 0** (81).

Finally, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [6]
}
```
