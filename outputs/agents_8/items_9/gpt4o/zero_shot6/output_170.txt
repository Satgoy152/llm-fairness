Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  92  57  58  24  55  24   9  48
1  15  69   3  12  46  55  90  77  44
2  80   4  45   8  97   1  38  32  78
3  93  75   2  42  29  78  49  90  97
4  62  95  38  35  35  36  28  94  58
5   6   7  99  30  13  50  23  78  34
6  91   2  33  24  79  67  66  63  68
7  58  19  81  61   4  46  62  69  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. The goal is to distribute all 9 items among the 8 agents.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 1 (92). Allocate item 1.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 6 (90). Allocate item 6.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 4 (97). Allocate item 4.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 8 (97). Allocate item 8.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 1 (95), but it's already taken. The next highest available is item 7 (94). Allocate item 7.
6. **Agent 5**: The highest valuation is for item 2 (99). Allocate item 2.
7. **Agent 6**: The highest valuation is for item 0 (91). Allocate item 0.
8. **Agent 7**: The highest valuation is for item 2 (81), but it's already taken. The next highest available is item 3 (61). Allocate item 3.

This allocation uses up 8 items, leaving one item unallocated. The next highest available valuation across all agents for the remaining item is agent 4's valuation for item 5 (36). Allocate item 5 to agent 4.

Now we have:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [8]
- Agent 4: [7, 5]
- Agent 5: [2]
- Agent 6: [0]
- Agent 7: [3]

Each agent has at least one item and all 9 items are allocated. Here is the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7, 5],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [3]
}
```
