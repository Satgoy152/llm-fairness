Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  50  56  26   1  45  61  89   5
1  58  15  56  50   1  57  70  65   0
2   6  28  58  96  67  81  47  72  51
3  79  75   3   9  34  14   7  91  44
4  81  90  20  48  38   8  63  71  44
5  74  84  27  46  52  59  52  50  43
6   4  61  97  48   9  22  25   3  81
7  86  96  23  94  13  88   5  96  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will need to receive more than one item. Let's attempt to distribute the items accordingly:

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Item 6 (Highest value for Agent 0)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 0 (Highest value for Agent 1)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 3 (Highest value for Agent 2)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 7 (Highest value for Agent 3)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 1 (Highest value for Agent 4)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 5 (Highest value for Agent 5)
7. **Agent 6**: Item 8 (Highest value for Agent 6)
8. **Agent 7**: Item 2 (Highest value for Agent 7)

Now, since we have allocated 8 items and have one item left to allocate, we need to decide who should receive an additional item. We can choose based on who will benefit the most from an additional item:

- Agent 7 has high valuations for multiple items. Assigning Agent 7 another item can help balance valuations.

9. **Agent 7**: Item 4 (Second highest value for Agent 7)

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
