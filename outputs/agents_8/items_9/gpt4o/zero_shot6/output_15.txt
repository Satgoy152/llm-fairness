Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  33  67  22  43  87  38  25  36
1  43  55  73   8  74   6  61   2  43
2  40  98  62  11  43  49  85  12   6
3  54  75  64  92  48  28  14  69  15
4  80   0  28  33  77  60  30  83  40
5  55  21  72  86  62  69  66  94  69
6  76  23  89  38  33  37  21  40  70
7  37  18  43  38  98  63  97  45  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple algorithm. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. This is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Evaluate the highest valuation for each item among all agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. Ensure all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 0 (76).
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 2 (98).
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 6 (89).
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 3 (92).
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 7 (98).
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 0 (87).
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 7 (97).
- Item 7 is valued highest by agent 5 (94).
- Item 8 is valued highest by agent 7 (96).

Given this allocation strategy, here is the resulting JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [4, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are assigned while considering the highest valuation by each agent for an item.
