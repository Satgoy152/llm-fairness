Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  21   7  53   0  41  12  69  44
1  67  33  58  78  56  61  52  42  85
2  59  27  37  47  21  82  23   2  66
3   4  15  62  76  59   9  13  54  41
4  60  77  40  33  20  78  11  76  25
5  82  71  50  60  28   7  50  78  33
6  41  20  59   9  19  36  92  93  12
7  55  99  61  21  63  34  33  85  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated exactly once and every agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item across all agents, and try to allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation for it.
2. Ensure no agent is overloaded by adjusting allocations as necessary to maintain a balance.

Let's go through the table to allocate each item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (82).
- **Item 1**: Agent 7 has the highest valuation (99).
- **Item 2**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (62).
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (78).
- **Item 4**: Agent 7 has the highest valuation (63).
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (82).
- **Item 6**: Agent 6 has the highest valuation (92).
- **Item 7**: Agent 6 has the highest valuation (93).
- **Item 8**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (85).

Allocating based on these valuations, we get:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6, 7],
    "7": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated once and every agent receives an integer number of items, with a fair distribution based on the highest valuations.
