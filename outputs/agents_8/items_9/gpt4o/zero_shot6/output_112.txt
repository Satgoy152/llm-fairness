Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  72  41  44  16  25  14  59  65
1  89  99   4  32  46  46  57  15  46
2  33  86  11  71  33  39  22  88  11
3  60  91  34  21  93   6  19  23   6
4  66  21  98  20   6  47  82   7  51
5  75  94  44  13  11   0  37   4  71
6  55  89  36  71  53  62  76  21  33
7  14  11  44  90   9  43   5  75  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents where each agent should receive an integer number of items, we can utilize a method that seeks to balance the total valuation each agent receives. This approach aims to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is as even as possible, considering the constraints.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 0.
2. Agent 1 gets item 1.
3. Agent 2 gets item 2.
4. Agent 3 gets item 4.
5. Agent 4 gets item 3.
6. Agent 5 gets item 8.
7. Agent 6 gets item 5.
8. Agent 7 gets items 6 and 7.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed to the agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [6, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation seeks to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated equals 9.
