Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  41  82  65  64  70  24  21  86
1  83  54  39  75  53  45  50  67  80
2  81   5  44  54  22   3  38  75  37
3  85  89  75  74  55   0  94  69  59
4  91  70  78  99  10  49  57  92  30
5  27  32  29  55  39  57  39  35  52
6  57  43  32  26  33  54  18  27  41
7  26  75   1  43  97  41  93  65  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items based on maximizing their individual valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the constraint that there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the rest will receive 1.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 4, as agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 1, since agent 1 values item 0 highly.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 3, since agent 3 values item 1 highly.
4. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as agent 0 highly values item 2.
5. Assign item 5 to agent 5, since agent 5 values item 5 highly.
6. Assign item 4 to agent 7, as agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 4.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 6, since agent 6 values item 6 decently without better options.
8. Assign item 8 to agent 2, as agent 2 values item 8 highly.
9. Assign item 7 to agent 4, as agent 4 has the next highest valuation for item 7.

Based on the above rationale, here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their respective valuations within the constraints given.
