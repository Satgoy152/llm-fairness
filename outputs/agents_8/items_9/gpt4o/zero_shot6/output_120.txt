Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  35  48  98  63   8  11  65  15
1  52   6  77  71  35  14  60  39  42
2   9  33  75  69  60  83  56  47   9
3  10  67  85  15  25  23  68  66  83
4  49  56  69  26  95  49  51  87  32
5  99  64  74  24  46   2  93  51  27
6  37  42  90  93  50  38  21  16  40
7  20  84  54  69  58  22   5  74   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations of the items. With 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each. We aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 3 (value 98)
2. Agent 1: Item 2 (value 77)
3. Agent 2: Item 5 (value 83)
4. Agent 3: Item 8 (value 83)
5. Agent 4: Item 4 (value 95)
6. Agent 5: Item 0 (value 99)
7. Agent 6: Item 6 (value 21)
8. Agent 7: Items 1 and 7 (values 84 and 74)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed fairly based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [1, 7]
}
```
