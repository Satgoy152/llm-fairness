Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  99  20  37  46  22  56  82  35
1   5  31  61  55  51  67   4  41  69
2  29  50  10  49  94  55  46  39  87
3  80  73  82  33  75  57  36   3  53
4   3  75  19  48  97   8  63  96  47
5  28  60  29  95  37  55  17  63  15
6  13  39  69  67  47  67  77  94  25
7  68  25  46  86  70  38  59  49  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for the items. Given that there are 8 agents and 9 items, one approach could be to assign items based on the highest value an agent places on them while ensuring each item is allocated only once.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (value 99)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (value 61)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (value 94)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (value 80)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (value 96)
- Agent 5: Item 3 (value 95)
- Agent 6: Item 6 (value 77)
- Agent 7: Item 8 (value 91)

Since there are 9 items, one more item has to be allocated. Let's assign item 5 to Agent 1 because it's the next highest valuation and Agent 1 has only one item so far.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [8]
}
```
