Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  96  83  42  81  24  92  28  93
1  62  72  14  71  55  74  58  52  51
2   3   3  82   0  16  91  60   4  38
3  80   3  28   4   6  44  39  59  26
4  79  64   5  68  87  44  11  48  96
5  48  27  36  47  70  12   9  47  11
6  56   5  95  36  69  47  14  93  83
7  18  94  75  17  62  40  38  59  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that all items are distributed while considering each agent's valuation of the items. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Highest valuation for items 1, 6, and 8.
2. Agent 1: Highest valuation for item 5.
3. Agent 2: Highest valuation for item 2.
4. Agent 3: Highest valuation for item 0.
5. Agent 4: Highest valuation for item 4.
6. Agent 5: Moderate valuation for item 3.
7. Agent 6: Highest valuation for item 7.
8. Agent 7: Highest valuation for item 1 is already assigned, so assign item 3, which is still available.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [7],
    "7": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is distributed, maximizing the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.
