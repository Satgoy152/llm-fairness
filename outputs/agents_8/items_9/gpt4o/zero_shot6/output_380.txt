Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  66  21  81  95  92  62  85  97
1  92  15  27  88   7  50  25  34  13
2  75  33  98  77  17  69  36  31  30
3  74  36  35  50  36  67  21  88   6
4  24  49  19   5  68   8  16  33  82
5  62  61  82  42  75  16  33  37   1
6  88  93  52  54   4  67  48   0  24
7  27  19  49  55  41  64  76  11  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will distribute the 9 items (numbered 0 to 8) to the 8 agents (numbered 0 to 7). One approach to ensure fairness is to consider the highest valuations and allocate items to agents who value them the most, while also ensuring each agent has a fair opportunity to receive items. 

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 8 (value 97).
2. Agent 1 receives item 3 (value 88).
3. Agent 2 receives item 2 (value 98).
4. Agent 3 receives item 7 (value 88).
5. Agent 4 receives item 4 (value 68).
6. Agent 5 receives item 6 (value 33).
7. Agent 6 receives item 1 (value 93).
8. Agent 7 receives item 5 (value 64).
9. Agent 0 receives item 0 (value 94) to ensure all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the items are distributed based on high valuations.
