Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  28  51  76  73  19  39  39  43
1  78  98  62  81  52  30  49  51   5
2  39   1  15  36  13  53  38  19  43
3  10  25  90   3  95  33  13  46  13
4  71  89  54  52   3  48  99  43  25
5  84  32   6  75  95  48  38  12  29
6  99  90   6   4  83  63  24  90   7
7  84  99  47  20   8  97  90  38  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 8 agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items such that the allocation is balanced. Given there are 9 items and 8 agents, one or more agents will receive more than one item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the highest, where possible, without duplication.
2. Ensure all items are allocated.
3. Balance the allocation as fairly as possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (highest value for item 0).
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (highest value for item 1).
- Agent 2 gets item 5 (highest value for item 5).
- Agent 3 gets item 2 (highest value for item 2).
- Agent 4 gets item 6 (highest value for item 6).
- Agent 5 gets item 4 (highest value for item 4).
- Agent 6 gets item 7 (highest value for item 7).
- Agent 7 gets items 3 and 8 (highest available values for items 3 and 8).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [3, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent receives an integer number of items, and no item is allocated to more than one agent.
