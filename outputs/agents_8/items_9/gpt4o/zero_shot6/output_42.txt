Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  90  60  10  71   3   4  91  73
1  99  11  18  52   3  15  47  97  51
2  72  77  10  36  32  68  25  94  89
3  28  53  67  63  81  26  50  33  58
4  91  74  56  71  25  43   5  65  38
5  34  57  40  50  59  29   8  59  28
6  42  28   2  33   9  11  36  64   4
7  87  43  69  47  54  66  28  22  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we aim to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the distribution feels balanced. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 7 and 8.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a moderate valuation across many items, highest for item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Has a high valuation for item 0.
6. **Agent 5**: Has moderate valuations, item 4 is the highest.
7. **Agent 6**: Has low valuations across all items.
8. **Agent 7**: Has a high valuation for item 2.

Based on these observations, here is a possible allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 6.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 7.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 has a high valuation for this item too).

This ensures each agent receives at least one item and the total allocation is 9 items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [2]
}
```
