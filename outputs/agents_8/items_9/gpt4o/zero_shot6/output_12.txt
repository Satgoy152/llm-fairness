Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  18  43   8  30  75  42  56   2
1  48  56  80  42  51  32  83   5  22
2  48   0  45  15  95  14  14   0  31
3  83  58  43  26  48   4  15  95  82
4  65  46   3  84  73  60  77  99  77
5  49  65  76  75  47  82  94  69  75
6  46  10  39  45  15  45  36  56  51
7  77   7  76  83  23  65  16   2  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we will consider maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. We can use a simple approach where we iterate over each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring no agent receives more than slightly more than their fair share.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Allocate item 0:** Agent 3 has the highest value of 83.
2. **Allocate item 1:** Agent 3 has the highest value of 58.
3. **Allocate item 2:** Agent 1 has the highest value of 80.
4. **Allocate item 3:** Agent 4 has the highest value of 84.
5. **Allocate item 4:** Agent 2 has the highest value of 95.
6. **Allocate item 5:** Agent 5 has the highest value of 82.
7. **Allocate item 6:** Agent 5 has the highest value of 94.
8. **Allocate item 7:** Agent 4 has the highest value of 99.
9. **Allocate item 8:** Agent 3 has the highest value of 82.

This allocation involves some agents receiving more items than others, which may need balancing for fairness. Let's adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and no agent receives an unfair number of items.

Revised allocation:
- Give item 0 to Agent 3.
- Give item 1 to Agent 0.
- Give item 2 to Agent 1.
- Give item 3 to Agent 4.
- Give item 4 to Agent 2.
- Give item 5 to Agent 5.
- Give item 6 to Agent 6.
- Give item 7 to Agent 7.
- Give item 8 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 8.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This way, each agent receives at least one item while ensuring that items are allocated based on their valuations.
