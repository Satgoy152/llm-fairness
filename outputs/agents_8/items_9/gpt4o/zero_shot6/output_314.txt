Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  19   9  97  27   2  18  59  80
1  90  45   0  45  26  56  77   2  83
2  65  29  94  28  52  16  40   0  86
3  95  24  72  46  80  53  72  94  82
4  86  13  41  66  15  47  36  95   7
5  94  16  62  94  21  71   8   9  51
6  45  79  92  79  41  45  33  80  64
7  45  33  81  28  50  15  84  94  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives by assigning items based on their highest valuations. It is important to ensure that each agent is considered, and we allocate exactly 9 items in total.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Start by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. This helps in maximizing individual satisfaction.

2. **Ensure Each Agent is Considered:** While trying to maximize the total valuation, we should also ensure each agent is in consideration for allocation. Given that there are 8 agents and 9 items, some agents might not receive any items.

3. **Allocate Items:** Assign items based on the highest valuations, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

Here is a possible allocation of the items:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (97)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (90)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (94)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (94)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (36)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (71)
- Agent 6: Item 1 (79)
- Agent 7: Item 8 (73)

This allocation assigns each item to the agent who values it highly, ensuring a fair distribution of items.

Now, let's present the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [8]
}
```
