Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  42  21  73  16  39  94  62  87
1  49  72  53  60  10  58  94  56  22
2  16  54  69  90  28  41  46  79  17
3  76  21  72  32  64  64  93  38  80
4  97  25  70  56  95  72  97  52  81
5  28  86  59  45  82  18  45  77  70
6  87  77  90  22  99   2   9  17  70
7  61  46  21  64  20  98  34  46  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuation of the items. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, at least one agent will receive more than one item.

Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with an allocation strategy. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that each agent gets the item they value most highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **High Valuation Preference**: Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation, ensuring each gets their most preferred available item.
2. **Balancing**: Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and no item is left unallocated.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (value 94).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (value 94), but item 6 is already taken. Next highest for agent 1 is item 1 (value 72).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (value 90).
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (value 93), but item 6 is already taken. Next highest for agent 3 is item 8 (value 80).
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 97).
- **Agent 5**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 86), but item 1 is already taken. Next highest for agent 5 is item 7 (value 77).
- **Agent 6**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 99).
- **Agent 7**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (value 98).

Now, let's check the allocation:
- Items allocated so far: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 
- Item 2 is unallocated.

Distribute the remaining item (item 2) to an agent with fewer items:
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 3. Consider giving item 2 to an agent with no items yet.
- **Agent 1**: Currently has one item, item 1.
- **Agent 3**: Currently has one item, item 8.

Allocate item 2 to **Agent 3** since they have room and initially contested for item 6.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [8, 2],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent is assigned at least one item, and all items are distributed.
