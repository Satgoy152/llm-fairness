Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33   2  73  80   7  61  11  44  38
1  72  92  98  22  51  48  83  14  11
2  19  41  70  58  85  23  68  31  17
3  43  95  86  63  71  30  68  57  29
4  70  75  89  63  62  35  66  11  61
5  34  92  13   7  69  93  63  35  51
6  70  46  57  45  47  76  69  56  88
7  90  84  77   8  94  22  44  35  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the preferences of each agent. A simple way to approach this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent gets more than 9 items and every item is allocated.

Let's assign the items:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 7 (value: 90).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (value: 95).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (value: 98).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value: 80).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 7 (value: 94).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 5 (value: 93).
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (value: 83).
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value: 44).
9. **Item 8**: The highest valuation is by agent 6 (value: 88).

Now, let's format these allocations into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most while respecting the constraint that all items are allocated and each agent is included in the JSON format.
