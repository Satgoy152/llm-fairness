Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14   1  44  51  46   2  60  99  72
1  90  40  29  14  14   7  51   1  27
2  12  85  95  75  19  49  82  26  90
3  93   4  87  59  26  19  14  22  53
4  45  82  95  67  37  33  18   5  47
5  34   9  65  80  29  63  19  50  82
6   0  58   6  18  38  76  27  56  53
7  91  29  70  65  30  28  29  65  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can use a simple approach aiming to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that every item is allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most with 93.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most with 85.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most with 95.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most with 51.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most with 46.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 6 values it the most with 76.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most with 60.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most with 99.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it the most with 72.

After assigning the items based on maximum valuations, let's adjust to ensure fairness and that every agent gets at least one item:

- Initially, Agent 0 has 5 items (3, 4, 6, 7, 8), Agent 2 has 2 items (1, 2), Agent 3 has 1 item (0), and Agent 6 has 1 item (5).
- We need to distribute some items from Agent 0 to others to ensure fairness.

Revising allocations to ensure fairness:
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 5 (second-highest valuation after Agent 0).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 7 (second-highest valuation after Agent 0).
- Leave Agent 0 with Items 6, 7, and 8.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 8],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [4]
}
```

With this allocation, each item is assigned, and every agent gets at least one item or none based on their highest valuations.
