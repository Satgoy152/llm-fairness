Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  23  17  71   5   2  36  87  90
1  54  97  72   4  34  57  91  48  14
2  14  51  68  58  17  96  48  63  30
3  22  89   9  42  80  33  96  77  20
4  61   2  57  74  88  12  51  63  53
5  74   8  81  80  35  51  63  76  24
6  76  25  30  83  66  17   6  26  19
7  14   8  64   5  19  80  60  12  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair chance based on their valuations. The challenge is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and the total number of items allocated equals 9. We can prioritize assigning items based on the highest valuations to ensure fairness and satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation strategy, keeping in mind that each agent should get an integer number of items and that all items should be allocated:

- Agent 0 highly values item 8 (90) and item 7 (87).
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 (97) and item 6 (91).
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (96).
- Agent 3 highly values item 6 (96).
- Agent 4 highly values item 4 (88).
- Agent 5 highly values item 2 (81).
- Agent 6 highly values item 3 (83).
- Agent 7 highly values item 8 (99) and item 5 (80).

Considering these valuations, a possible allocation is:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [2]
- Agent 6: [3]
- Agent 7: [8]
- Agent 0: [0] (Reallocating to ensure all items are distributed)

This ensures each agent gets at least one item and the items are distributed fairly based on the highest valuations. This allocation uses all 9 items.

Here is the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [8]
}
```
