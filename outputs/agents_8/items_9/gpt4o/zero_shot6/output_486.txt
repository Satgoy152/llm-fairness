Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  76  19  51  14  12  94  48  92
1  71  37  85   2  48  74  89  14  46
2   2  67  96  99   6  50  15  92  72
3   6  46  99  30  18  47  35   9  12
4  72  87  82  78  83  51  11  30  24
5  97  78  59  61  35  49  60  75  11
6  56  69  39  34  10  17  74   5  34
7  18  15  55  35  40  86  90  93  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents while ensuring that each item is assigned to one agent, we can use a simple approach by considering a combination of each agent's valuation for the items and ensuring a balanced distribution. Here is one potential allocation:

1. Assign items based on highest valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item until all items are allocated.
2. If there are more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 94).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 85).
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 99).
- Agent 3 gets item 4 (value 18).
- Agent 4 gets item 1 (value 87).
- Agent 5 gets item 0 (value 97).
- Agent 6 gets item 8 (value 34).
- Agent 7 gets items 5 and 7 (values 86 and 93, respectively).

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
