Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60   5  47  27  12  67  76  88  32
1   9  41  33  91  32  34  68  26  86
2  63  22  41   1  14  56  11  25   5
3  57  14  54  51  85  56  62  11  73
4  30   2  28  79  13  24  29  30   0
5  55  24  79  82  47  10  56  89  17
6  29  46  25  79  90  54  14  92  78
7  70  52  75  87  91  31  48   7  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable distribution based on their valuations. We'll aim for a fair distribution where each agent gets at least one item, as there are 9 items and 8 agents. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring each item is assigned only once.
   - If an item is the highest value for multiple agents, assign it to the agent with the next highest value for another item.

2. **Equal Distribution:**
   - Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items. We can assign the additional item to the agent with the next highest valuation of a remaining item.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 7 (value: 88).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value: 91).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value: 63).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4 (value: 85).
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3, but since it is already allocated to Agent 1, we allocate their next highest, item 7 (value: 30).
- Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 7, but since it is already allocated, we assign item 2 (value: 79).
- Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 4, but since it's allocated, we assign item 8 (value: 78).
- Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 4, but since it's allocated, we assign item 6 (value: 48).

Now, we have 8 items allocated. We need to assign the last remaining item. Let's optimize by analyzing remaining values:

- Agent 0 can be assigned item 5 (value: 67), as it's their next highest unallocated item.

With 9 items allocated, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, with the exception of Agent 3 who does not receive any item in this fair distribution. Adjustment can be made if a different fairness criterion is applied.
