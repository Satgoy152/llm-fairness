Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  47  16  20  90  53  76  82   4
1  27  21   9  92  77  63  39  60  46
2  48  86  65   4  88  95  78   6  41
3  85  41  99  74  94  50  89  34  71
4  39  31   6  39  57  82  95  97  80
5  50  75  54   5  64  94  37  74  68
6  97  88  25  47  44  94  61  64  34
7  10  58  24  40  32  42  32  99  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [10 58 24 40 32 42 32 99 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 6, as they have the highest valuation for it (97).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it (86).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3, as they have the highest valuation for it (99).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it (92).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3, as they have the second highest valuation for it (94). 
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation for it (95).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 4, as they have the highest valuation for it (95).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 7, as they have the highest valuation for it (99).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 4, as they have the highest remaining valuation for it (80).

This allocation ensures that each of the 9 items is assigned to an agent and tries to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [6, 8],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [7]
}
```
