Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  23  99  13  46  39  20   7  58
1  35  67   1  70  13  98  64  22  51
2   4  74  50  53  21   6   2  97  76
3  30  35  27  80  77  54   4  20  38
4  50  89  43  62  22  15  62  81  50
5  11  18  82  56  16  12   1  18  82
6  71  48  77  34  75  30  76  32  26
7  12  91  68  13  14  44  13  19   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. Let's attempt to distribute the items based on the highest valuation expressed by each agent.

Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign item 2 (value 99)
- Agent 1: Assign item 5 (value 98)
- Agent 2: Assign item 7 (value 97)
- Agent 3: Assign item 3 (value 80)
- Agent 4: Assign item 1 (value 89)
- Agent 5: Assign item 8 (value 82)
- Agent 6: Assign item 0 (value 71)
- Agent 7: Assign item 4 (value 14)
- Item 6 remains unallocated, let's allocate it to the agent who values it the most:
  - Agent 6 (value 76)

Now, each agent has been allocated an item based on their highest preference, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [0, 6],
    "7": [4]
}
```
