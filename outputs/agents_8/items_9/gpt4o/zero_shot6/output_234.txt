Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  80  80  99  31  93  98   1  36
1  45  45  35  66  71  59  89  52  13
2  66  34  73  43  29   7   1  67  65
3  60  96  30  37  63  90  58  45   6
4   8  88  35  97  50  43  75  59  42
5  93   5  81  36  33  95   6   8  80
6  52  70  39  79   6   8  79  80  91
7  83  10  43  86  27   9  10  32  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to allocate all 9 items such that the distribution is as fair as possible.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where items are distributed to agents based on their highest valuations. However, we must ensure that the allocation is fair, meaning each agent should have at least one item if possible.

Below is a suggested allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Adjust the allocation if needed to ensure fairness and all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Best items: 3, 6 (total valuation 197)
- Agent 1:
  - Best item: 4 (valuation 71)
- Agent 2:
  - Best item: 2 (valuation 73)
- Agent 3:
  - Best item: 1 (valuation 96)
- Agent 4:
  - Best item: 8 (valuation 42)
- Agent 5:
  - Best item: 5 (valuation 95)
- Agent 6:
  - Best item: 7 (valuation 80)
- Agent 7:
  - Best item: 0 (valuation 83)

With this allocation, each agent receives one item initially. If adjustments are needed to ensure all 9 items are distributed, the allocation can be adjusted:

To allocate fairly, here is one possible solution:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
