Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  97  46  88  39  56  46  48  18
1  94  45  76   6  46  41  87  72  93
2  96  56  62  18  90  12  54  63  33
3  43  41  32  33   4  74  11  76  45
4  56  22   3  81  80  51  49  63  87
5  85  38  29  12  42  42  73  54  32
6  94  63   2  21  54  75  33  52  31
7  33   7  66  38  82  93  12  39  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers both the valuations and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this: 

1. Start by allocating the item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, given there are more items than agents.
3. Distribute remaining items to maximize the overall happiness based on valuations.

Following these steps, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (highest value 97)
- Agent 1 gets item 8 (highest value 93)
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (highest value 96)
- Agent 3 gets item 7 (highest value 76)
- Agent 4 gets item 4 (highest value 80)
- Agent 5 gets item 6 (highest value 73)
- Agent 6 gets item 5 (highest value 75)
- Agent 7 gets item 3 (highest value 38)
- Agent 7 also gets item 2 (next highest value 66)

This distribution considers each agent's highest valued item and attempts to balance the allocation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [2, 3]
}
```
