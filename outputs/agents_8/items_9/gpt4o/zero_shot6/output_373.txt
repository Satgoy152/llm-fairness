Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  41  44  67  85  52  26  98   6
1  91  61  21  53  89  73  25   5  53
2  96   0  66  57  55  99  72  42  38
3  45   1  83  23  32  17  30  24   7
4  28   3  83  54  92  73  15  21  55
5  93  50  69  57   5  26  81  23  77
6  60   3  77  60  32  42  67  78  29
7  33  88  86  15  21  13   1  95  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, I will consider a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one item each.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: (Item 7) - Highest value for item 7.
2. **Agent 1**: (Item 0) - Highest value for item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: (Item 5) - Highest value for item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: (Item 2) - Highest value for item 2.
5. **Agent 4**: (Item 4) - Highest value for item 4.
6. **Agent 5**: (Item 8) - Highest value for item 8.
7. **Agent 6**: (Item 6) - Highest value for item 6.
8. **Agent 7**: (Item 1 and 3) - High values for items 1 and 3.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and one agent receives two items.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [1, 3]
}
```
