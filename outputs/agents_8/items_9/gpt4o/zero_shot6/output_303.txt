Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  19  81   5  41  42  95   0  81
1  87  18  46  74  79  37  69  11  84
2  47  54  35  77  36  61  18  17  48
3  75  51  86  15  70  43  20   4   1
4  16  14  84  54  25  63  63  14  15
5  12  13  84  57  55  99  35  34  32
6  23  27  57  50  89  73  93  85  29
7  67  85  65  46   2  54  91  10  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation by examining the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for items [0, 2, 6, 8].
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for items [0, 3, 4, 8].
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for items [1, 3, 5].
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for items [0, 2, 4].
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation for items [2, 5, 6].
6. **Agent 5**: High valuation for items [2, 3, 5].
7. **Agent 6**: High valuation for items [4, 5, 6, 7].
8. **Agent 7**: High valuation for items [1, 7, 8].

Given these preferences, we will aim to distribute items to maximize satisfaction based on valuations.

### Allocation Strategy

- Assign item 0 to **Agent 0** (highest valuation).
- Assign item 1 to **Agent 7** (highest valuation).
- Assign item 2 to **Agent 3** (highest valuation).
- Assign item 3 to **Agent 1** (high valuation).
- Assign item 4 to **Agent 6** (highest valuation).
- Assign item 5 to **Agent 5** (highest valuation).
- Assign item 6 to **Agent 0** (second-highest valuation).
- Assign item 7 to **Agent 6** (second-highest valuation).
- Assign item 8 to **Agent 1** (high valuation).

This allocation considers the high-value items for each agent and distributes the items fairly while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4, 7],
    "7": [1]
}
```
