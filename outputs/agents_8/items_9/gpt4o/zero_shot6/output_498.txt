Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  10  84  54  54  96  27  97  27
1  88  32  69  29   9  18  55  13  75
2  42  61  37   6  99  46  23  37  47
3   3   7  45  64  72  83   0  98  14
4   9  25   0  36   2  50  28  94  53
5  78  50  63  39  11  66  29  30  73
6  29  14  98  49  38  15  93  40  43
7  11  44  14  64  16  26  78  13  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. We should try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.

One possible way to allocate the items while considering fairness and maximizing each agent's total value is as follows:

1. Identify the highest value an agent has for any item and allocate that item to the agent.
2. Continue the process for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
3. Balance the allocation by ensuring each agent has at least one item, if possible, but no more than two items since we have 8 agents and 9 items.

Following this approach, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 96)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 8 (values 88, 75)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (value 99)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (value 98)
- Agent 4: Item 3 (value 36)
- Agent 5: Item 2 (value 63)
- Agent 6: Item 6 (value 93)
- Agent 7: Item 1 (value 44)

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in such a way that agents receive items they value highly while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [1]
}
```
