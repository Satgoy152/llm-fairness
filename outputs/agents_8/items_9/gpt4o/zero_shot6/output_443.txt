Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  58  66  41  33  25  47  24  34
1  19  13  16  41  94  44  71  64  69
2  93  40   8   0  90  67  83  80  56
3  92  36  34  97  27   8  87  97  40
4  12  74  55  68   4  70  19  65  55
5  85  69  76  73  69  55  28  85  78
6   1  80  26  10  76  34  32  76  16
7  82  22  47  21  65   8  95  58  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring all items are allocated and no agent receives more than one item if possible due to the constraint of having more agents than items. Here's a reasonable allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 0. We can assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly. We assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 highly, but since Agent 0 has already taken item 2, we assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 and 7 highly. We can assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a relatively high valuation for item 1. We assign item 1 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 values item 8 highly. We assign item 8 to Agent 5.
7. Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 7. We assign item 7 to Agent 6.
8. Agent 7 values item 6 highly. We assign item 6 to Agent 7.

This allocation distributes the items fairly based on the given valuations, trying to give each agent a high-value item where possible. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [6]
}
```
