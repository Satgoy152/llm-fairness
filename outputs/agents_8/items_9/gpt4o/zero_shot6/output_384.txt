Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  79  54  73  71  38  51  63  63
1  43  15  27  90  66   2  88  92  81
2  83  23  92  55  90  34   6  53  76
3  83  80  95  20  26  17  26  52  20
4  76  33  80  79  10   6  26  48  13
5  53  15  16  42  33  29  61   7  69
6   1  12  54  98  56  40  95  55   4
7  64  22  31  64  38  52  74  72   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple greedy method. We'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation:

- Item 0 is most valued by agent 2 with a value of 83.
- Item 1 is most valued by agent 0 with a value of 79.
- Item 2 is most valued by agent 3 with a value of 95.
- Item 3 is most valued by agent 6 with a value of 98.
- Item 4 is most valued by agent 2 with a value of 90.
- Item 5 is most valued by agent 7 with a value of 52.
- Item 6 is most valued by agent 6 with a value of 95.
- Item 7 is most valued by agent 1 with a value of 92.
- Item 8 is most valued by agent 1 with a value of 81.

Let's present this allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [3, 6],
    "7": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents fairly, based on their individual valuations.
