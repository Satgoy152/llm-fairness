Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  94   8  50  70  16  27  74  67
1  97  47  51  88  33  35  98  86  69
2  43  28  24  37  50   2  79  81  95
3   4  14  20  38  81  10  18  56  18
4  41  73  22  10  47  21  94  87  44
5  48  25  82   5  64  31  40  28  32
6  66  71  54  41  33  94   2  14  63
7  62  89  85   1  77  55  98  48  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. We will try to maximize the total valuation by each agent for the items they receive.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure no agent receives more than one item unless unavoidable.

Let's analyze the table and allocate items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it most at 97.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it most at 94.
- Item 2: Agent 5 values it most at 82.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it most at 88.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it most at 81.
- Item 5: Agent 6 values it most at 94.
- Item 6: Agent 7 values it most at 98.
- Item 7: Agent 4 values it most at 87.
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it most at 95.

Now let's ensure that this allocation respects the constraints:

- Agent 0: 1 item (item 1)
- Agent 1: 2 items (items 0 and 3)
- Agent 2: 1 item (item 8)
- Agent 3: 1 item (item 4)
- Agent 4: 1 item (item 7)
- Agent 5: 1 item (item 2)
- Agent 6: 1 item (item 5)
- Agent 7: 1 item (item 6)

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and no agent receives more than one item unless unavoidable. Here is the JSON output:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [6]
}
```
