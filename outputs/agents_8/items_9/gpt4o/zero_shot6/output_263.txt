Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  17  63  16  13  82  86  86  77
1  25  39  91   3  97  78  14   2  35
2  20  93  99  58  86  72   3  66  34
3  93  69  97  45   7  83  48  45  12
4  26  17  95  17  89  35  58  77  78
5   7  50   7  21  89  72   0   2   2
6   2  75  12  49  30  43  79  96  97
7  21  20  14  95  76  66  54  14  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the sum of the allocations for each agent while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent. One way to approach this is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most.

Let's go through the items one by one and assign them:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 3 with a value of 93.
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 2 with a value of 93.
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 2 with a value of 99.
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 7 with a value of 95.
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 1 with a value of 97.
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 0 with a value of 82.
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 6 with a value of 79.
- Item 7 is valued highest by agent 6 with a value of 96.
- Item 8 is valued highest by agent 6 with a value of 97.

Now let's allocate the items based on the above analysis:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [6, 7, 8],
    "7": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to exactly one agent, and the allocation is based on the highest valuation for each item.
