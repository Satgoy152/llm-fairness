Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  98   1  74  83  90   7  38  92
1  58  99  59   0  21  83  25  28  90
2  70  88  81  36  23  87  27  89  27
3   6   4  33   3  67  89  76  28  43
4  85  92  22   2  71  92  52   9  16
5  47  85  47  79   3  23  43  72  52
6   0  18  39  83  12  43  36  95  50
7  57  60  30   5  93  15  49  16  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for different items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others receive only one item each. 

Let's try to allocate the items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent, ensuring everyone gets at least one item. After evaluating the table, here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 98).
2. Agent 1 gets item 2 (value 59).
3. Agent 2 gets item 7 (value 89).
4. Agent 3 gets item 6 (value 76).
5. Agent 4 gets item 5 (value 92).
6. Agent 5 gets item 3 (value 79).
7. Agent 6 gets item 8 (value 50).
8. Agent 7 gets item 4 (value 93).

As we have 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive an additional item. We can allocate the remaining item 0 to the agent who benefits the most, considering the highest potential value. In this case, Agent 4 will also get item 0 (value 85), as this maximizes their total valuation among the remaining agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 0],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [4]
}
```
