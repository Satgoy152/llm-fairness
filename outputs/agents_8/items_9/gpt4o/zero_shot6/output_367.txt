Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  17   4  31  75  62  67  89  32
1  61  98  69  59  23  50  96   1  95
2  45  43  60   2  44  43   6  32  91
3  90  18  46   4  68  94   7  69   2
4  72  87  32  24  28  34  80  97  42
5  37  83   0  79  11  19  76  78  19
6  53  90  75  50  71  13  61  64  84
7  51  56  15  43  71  33   1  47  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given that there are 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive two items while others receive one.

Let's analyze the table and make the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (97).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (98).
3. Agent 2 values item 8 the highest (91).
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (94).
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the highest (97).
6. Agent 5 could take item 3, which they value at 79.
7. Agent 6 values item 2 the highest (75).
8. Agent 7 values item 8 second highest (85), but since item 8 is already taken, we'll give them item 4 (71).

Now, we have one item left, item 6. We will allocate it to the agent who values it next highest among those who received only one item:

- Agent 4 values item 6 at 80.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7, 6],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed fairly among the agents.
