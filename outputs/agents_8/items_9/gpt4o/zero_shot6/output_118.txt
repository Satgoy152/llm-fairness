Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  85  96  81  92  94  16  65  18
1   9   0  14  49  44  62   1  37   5
2  33   9  94  35  71  59  19  10  81
3  98   3  10  24  88  30  92  28  47
4  12  98  25  16  77  53  82  16  35
5  26  60  68  17  76  92  45  56  97
6   3  82  52  23   8  69   0   0  88
7  67  66  87  52  35  33  85  19  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, while also trying to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences. Let's start by analyzing the valuation matrix and then assigning the items.

1. **Agent 0:** High valuations for items 2 and 5.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 5.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuation is for item 0.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuation is for item 1.
6. **Agent 5:** Highest valuation is for item 8.
7. **Agent 6:** Highest valuation is for item 8.
8. **Agent 7:** High valuations for items 2, 0, 8.

We can allocate the items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the items while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** [0] - item 0 has a high valuation (81) for agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** [5] - item 5 is the highest valued item (62) for agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** [2] - item 2 is the highest valued item (94) for agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** [3] - item 3 has a reasonable valuation (24) for agent 3.
- **Agent 4:** [1] - item 1 is the highest valuation (98) for agent 4.
- **Agent 5:** [8] - item 8 is the highest valued item (97) for agent 5.
- **Agent 6:** [6] - item 6 is valued (0) for agent 6, but it needs to be allocated.
- **Agent 7:** [4, 7] - item 4 has a decent value (35) and item 7 has a reasonable value (19) for agent 7.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets an integer number of items:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [4, 7]
}
```
