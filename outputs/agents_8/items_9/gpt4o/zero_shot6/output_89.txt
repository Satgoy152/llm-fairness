Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  20  68  15  24  80  74  89  63
1  39  36   7  72   7  97  16  11  25
2  68  10  10  30  82  23  83  64  24
3  86  42  23  77  80  69  31  91  47
4  12  87  11  55  44  52  35  13   0
5  33  73  97  29  42  85  10  60  44
6  57  83  32   6  48  54  87  65  72
7   0  15  60  51  66  78   5  10  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value. In this approach, I'll try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 5 (80) and 7 (89) are highly valued.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 5 (97) is highly valued.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 6 (83) is highly valued.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3 (77) and 7 (91) are highly valued.
5. **Agent 4**: Item 1 (87) is highly valued.
6. **Agent 5**: Item 2 (97) is highly valued.
7. **Agent 6**: Item 6 (87) is highly valued.
8. **Agent 7**: Item 5 (78) is highly valued.

Now let's allocate the items based on their high valuations:

- Agent 0: Item 7 (89)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (97)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (83)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (77)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (87)
- Agent 5: Item 2 (97)
- Agent 6: Item 8 (72)
- Agent 7: Item 4 (66)

Since we have allocated 8 items, we need to assign the final item:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (19) (as it's not highly valued by others and Agent 0 has relatively high valuation for item 0)

Now, all 9 items are allocated, ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [4]
}
```
