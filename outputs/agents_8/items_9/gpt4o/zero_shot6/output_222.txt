Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  12  29  12  63  41  64  57  45
1  91  71   9  81   5  40  54  36  75
2  79  26  53  66  12  98  92   6  18
3  55  80  69  12  91  73  65  19  64
4  21  18  50  61  60  56  84  18  95
5  41   7  16  89  12  51  23   2  35
6  49   1  44  61  30  47  65  50  65
7  94  51  17  94  95  82  52  79   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated equals 9. We should also consider the valuations to ensure a fair distribution of value.

Here is a possible allocation based on the given valuations, trying to maximize the overall satisfaction:

- Agent 0: [0] - This agent gets item 0, which they value highly.
- Agent 1: [8] - This agent values item 8 relatively high compared to others.
- Agent 2: [5] - Item 5 is highly valued by this agent.
- Agent 3: [1, 3] - This agent gets items 1 and 3, which they value reasonably well.
- Agent 4: [6] - Item 6 is valued well by this agent.
- Agent 5: [7] - Item 7 is assigned to this agent.
- Agent 6: [2] - This agent gets item 2.
- Agent 7: [4] - Item 4 is assigned to this agent.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [4]
}
```
