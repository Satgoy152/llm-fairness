Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  54  64  46  44  64  65  84  20
1  31  54  77  26  18  57  93   7  49
2  36  31  34  58   8  17  90  59  70
3  17  25  46  10  96  45  53   0  69
4  76  37  70  77  16  71  55  51  12
5  64  93  28   6  23  17  15  39   1
6  75  33  24  40  64   9  69   4  22
7  83   3  75  11  94  29  84  66  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. Create a list of tuples for each item, containing the item number and its highest valuation along with the corresponding agent.
2. Sort this list based on the highest valuation to prioritize allocation to the agent who values the item most.
3. Allocate items to agents based on the sorted list, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Following this approach:

1. For item 0, agent 0 values it the most at 85.
2. For item 1, agent 5 values it the most at 93.
3. For item 2, agent 1 values it the most at 77.
4. For item 3, agent 4 values it the most at 77.
5. For item 4, agent 3 values it the most at 96.
6. For item 5, agent 4 values it the most at 71.
7. For item 6, agent 1 values it the most at 93.
8. For item 7, agent 0 values it the most at 84.
9. For item 8, agent 7 values it the most at 73.

After assigning based on the highest valuation, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are assigned to the agents based on their highest valuations, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
