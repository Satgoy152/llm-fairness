Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  96  72  62  21  64  63  94  23
1  79  68  97  86   6  24  20  96  49
2  40  45  15  68  36  93  85  45  26
3  23  11  51  11  39  36  75  31  16
4  95  58  18  70  76  31  40  39  93
5  87  25  29  47  13  56  58  26  89
6  73   7  55  67   7  76  45   8  50
7  10  96  72  15  49  57   4  60  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

One way to approach this is to assign items to agents who value them the most while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, given the constraints of the problem.

After evaluating the highest valuations for each item, here's a potential allocation:

- Item 0 goes to Agent 4 (value 95).
- Item 1 goes to Agent 0 (value 96).
- Item 2 goes to Agent 1 (value 97).
- Item 3 goes to Agent 1 (value 86).
- Item 4 goes to Agent 4 (value 76).
- Item 5 goes to Agent 2 (value 93).
- Item 6 goes to Agent 3 (value 75).
- Item 7 goes to Agent 1 (value 96).
- Item 8 goes to Agent 4 (value 93).

This allocation ensures that most items are given to the agents who value them the most, and all items are distributed among the agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 4, 8],
    "5": [],
    "6": [],
    "7": []
}
```

This respects the requirement of allocating exactly 9 items among the agents and includes empty allocations for agents who don't receive any items.
