Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  14  65  75  85  62  30  94  76
1  38   5  72  11  36  36  41  35  18
2  62  41  60  26  71  75  41  80  25
3  37  41  73  53  66  18  77  49  54
4  33  30  46  96  55  88   8  28  31
5  28  60  98  89  83  82  96  74  71
6   1  35  68   8  78  27  64  64  98
7  64  36  87  97  17  78  32  14  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and every item is allocated. We can use a greedy approach to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 7 values it the most at 64.
2. Item 1: Agent 5 values it the most at 60.
3. Item 2: Agent 5 values it the most at 98.
4. Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most at 96.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
6. Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most at 88.
7. Item 6: Agent 5 values it the most at 96.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 94.
9. Item 8: Agent 6 values it the most at 98.

Let's put this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 5],
    "5": [1, 2, 6],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and every item is allocated while ensuring that all agents are considered.
