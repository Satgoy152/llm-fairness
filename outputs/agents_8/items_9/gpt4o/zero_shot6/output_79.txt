Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  99  26   9  49  95  82  50  28
1  61  17  77  39  84  25  73  51  79
2  75  79  94  89  82   9  30  30  12
3  99  74  94  19  26  50  45  75  73
4  44  69  67  69  56  89  87  13  32
5  65   1  85  82   3  57  82  18  49
6   5   0  89  59  33  13  99  52  96
7  84  45   8  76  68  60  47  21  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for a distribution where each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, some agents may get more than one item, while others may receive none.

Let's distribute the items by considering each agent's highest-valued items first. We'll aim for each agent to receive at least one highly valued item, if possible, and ensure that all items are allocated.

Here is a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Items [1] (value 99)
- Agent 1: Items [2] (value 77)
- Agent 2: Items [3] (value 89)
- Agent 3: Items [0] (value 99)
- Agent 4: Items [5] (value 89)
- Agent 5: Items [8] (value 49)
- Agent 6: Items [6] (value 99)
- Agent 7: Items [4, 7] (values 68, 21)

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item they value highly, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [4, 7]
}
```
