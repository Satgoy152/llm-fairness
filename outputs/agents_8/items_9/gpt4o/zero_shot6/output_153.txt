Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  12  18  75  99   8  50  42  50
1  31   3  75  76  18  76  50  91  73
2  61  71  20  65   1  59  37  19  91
3  77  46  38  90  23  96  40  84  86
4  11  69   0  67  61  96  59  49  78
5  51  83  33   0  95   1  11  76  75
6   3  76  73  38  60  68  72  19  92
7  79   9  66  97  47  11  85  59  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach to maximize the total valuations. One way to do this is by using a "highest bidder" approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 7 (79).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 5 (83).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (75).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 7 (97).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (99).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (96).
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by agent 7 (85).
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (91).
9. **Item 8**: The highest valuation is by agent 6 (92).

Now, based on these allocations, we can construct the JSON object that represents the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [0, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring all items are assigned.
