Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  79  16  98  45  46  62  48  76
1  36  81  51  98  85  55   7  79  15
2   2  66  99   1  60  61  39  81  82
3  63  60  72  34  83  25  93  21  11
4  62  85  79  74  29  12  58  92  23
5  92  12  57  29  76  54  37  56  65
6  19  80  64  16  51  55  13  94  26
7  32  75  74  17  60  70  88  75  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can adopt a strategy that aims to maximize individual satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. We will use a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each item:

1. Identify the agent with the highest valuation for each item.
2. Allocate the item to that agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure that all items are distributed.

Let's work through this process:

- Item 0: Agent 5 has the highest valuation (92).
- Item 1: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (81).
- Item 2: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (99).
- Item 3: Agent 0 and Agent 1 have the highest valuation (98). Assign to Agent 0 to balance allocations.
- Item 4: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (85).
- Item 5: Agent 7 has the highest valuation (70).
- Item 6: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (93).
- Item 7: Agent 6 has the highest valuation (94).
- Item 8: Agent 2 has the second highest valuation (82).

Now, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4
- Agent 2: Items 2, 8
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: No items yet
- Agent 5: Item 0
- Agent 6: Item 7
- Agent 7: Item 5

Since Agent 4 has no items, we need to adjust to ensure fairness. Let's reallocate:

- Take Item 4 from Agent 1 and give it to Agent 4.

Here's the adjusted allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 8
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 0
- Agent 6: Item 7
- Agent 7: Item 5

Total items allocated: 9

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [5]
}
```
