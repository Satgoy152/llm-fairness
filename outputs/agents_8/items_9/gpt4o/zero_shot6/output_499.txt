Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  68  89  74  60  94  39  78  45
1  49  88  25  16  45  41   5  97  58
2  73  10  47  21   5  20  71  99  47
3  69  96  21  77  81  41  59  22  80
4  90  99  79  27  35  37  96  30   5
5  24  60  81  18  30  18  76  69  20
6  12  81  65  45  63  73  38  34  84
7  62  78  97   7   9  90  42  47  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable distribution of items based on their valuations. We have 9 items and 8 agents, so one agent will receive two items while the others receive one item each.

The goal is to maximize the satisfaction or total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness. Here's one way to do this:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 4, as they have the highest valuation (90) for any item.
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation (88) for this item.
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 7, as they have the highest valuation (97) for this item.
4. Allocate item 3 to agent 3, as they have the highest valuation (77) for this item.
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 3, since they have the highest remaining potential valuation (81) for any item.
6. Allocate item 5 to agent 0, as they have the highest valuation (94) for this item.
7. Allocate item 6 to agent 4, as they have the highest remaining valuation (96) for this item.
8. Allocate item 7 to agent 2, as they have the highest valuation (99) for this item.
9. Allocate item 8 to agent 6, as they have the highest valuation (84) for this item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [0, 6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [2]
}
```
