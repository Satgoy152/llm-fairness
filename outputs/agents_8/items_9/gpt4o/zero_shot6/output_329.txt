Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  37  38  10   8  78  45  55   2
1  22  58  22  34  74   8  79  82   7
2  29  60   1  97  46  36  63  59  78
3  37  61  53  62  47  21  60  96  51
4  67  25  21  45  20  75   6  45  54
5  20  37  57  55  26  88  56  85  76
6  25  55  16  18  60   9  56  66  49
7  11  54  84  15  45  83  51  15  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, except for one agent who will receive no items since there are only 9 items to distribute.

One approach is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item based on the highest valuation they have for any item, and then allocate the remaining item to an agent who has the next highest valuation for any remaining item. 

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 7.
- Agent 4 has a relatively high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 8.
- Agent 6 can be assigned item 4.
- Agent 7 has a high valuation for item 2.

With this allocation, agent 1 receives one item while the rest of the agents receive items based on their highest valuations, ensuring a fair distribution.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [2]
}
```
