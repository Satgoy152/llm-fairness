Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  19  83  85  46  32  22  94  68
1  76   4  24  77  77  60   2  13  59
2  91  94   7  48  23  71  92  27  39
3  16   9  58  94  55  10  98  33  49
4  79  41  99  64  74  81  13  89  35
5  42  81  79  29  77  93  63  80  64
6  56  95  78  69  49  72  96  48  48
7  27  50  70  37  89  79  33  74  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction (i.e., the sum of valuations) while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible and every item is allocated. Given the constraints, we need to make strategic decisions based on the valuation table. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring every agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Balance the total number of items allocated to each agent.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 (value 85) and item 7 (value 94).
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 77).
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 91).
- Agent 3 gets item 6 (value 98).
- Agent 4 gets item 2 (value 99).
- Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 93).
- Agent 6 gets item 1 (value 95).
- Agent 7 gets item 8 (value 62).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [8]
}
```
