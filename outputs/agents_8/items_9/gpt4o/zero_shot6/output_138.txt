Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  10  51  56   1  35  37  14  89
1  38  29  51  47  69  56  84   9   3
2  22   9  91  85  92  26  21  55  67
3  94  16   8  59  37  82  95  11  74
4  35  16  80  28  66  34  23  68  27
5  48  37  42  23  51   1  69  51  32
6   2  67   4  35   4  96   8  47  46
7  49  16  93  34  80  67  63  82  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 8 agents, we should aim to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the distribution is as balanced as possible in terms of the agents' valuations. Given there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others will each receive one. 

Let's consider each agent's highest-valued item and attempt to allocate based on those preferences while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 8 the highest with 89. Assign item 8 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the highest with 84. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest with 92. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 highly too, but since it's already assigned, the next highest is item 0 with 94. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the highest with 80. Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Values item 6 the highest with 69, but it's assigned. Next is item 0 with 48, but it's also assigned. Then item 1 with 37. Assign item 1 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 5 the highest with 96. Assign item 5 to Agent 6.
8. **Agent 7**: Values item 2 the highest with 93, but it's assigned. Next is item 7 with 82. Assign item 7 to Agent 7.

Now, we have one more item (item 3) that needs to be allocated. Let's assign it to an agent who doesn't have the highest valuation focus:

- **Agent 4** could use an additional item as they have a relatively low-valued item compared to their other options. Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 3],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [7]
}
```
