Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  50   0  33   9  10  75  49  48
1  98  48  48  21  60  26  61  48  15
2  74  95  82  95  97  63  58  96  13
3   6  45  64   0  89  83  49  39  53
4  77  47  45  92  39   2  81  75   4
5   0  35  92  51  14  22  45  62  84
6  55  81  45  41  68  41  45  46  39
7  29  68  53  95   4  52  51  59  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and the allocation is balanced in terms of total value. Given the valuations provided, I'll try to distribute the items so that each agent receives items with relatively high value to them, while ensuring an equitable distribution.

Below is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 3
- Agent 5: Item 2
- Agent 6: Item 1
- Agent 7: Items 7, 8

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [7, 8]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item. Agent 7, who has relatively high valuations for multiple items, receives two items to balance the distribution.
