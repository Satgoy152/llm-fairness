Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  55  13  79  23  16  47  37  36
1  88  37  60  66  77   7  75  77  19
2  77  29  26  27  55  88  91  13  95
3  37  10  13   5  84  65   3   7  44
4   4   9  51  65  34  87   3  57  61
5  19  42   8  51  28  63  60  25  12
6  27  58  71   7  52  38  65  39  69
7  75  83  54  97  32  39  60  64  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to distribute the 9 items in such a way that each agent receives some items and the total valuation is balanced. One common approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the individual value each agent places on the items, thereby ensuring that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation. Here's one way to perform such an allocation:

1. **Assign items based on highest unique valuations**: Start by assigning items to agents who have the highest unique valuation for an item, meaning no other agent values that item as high.

2. **Assign remaining items based on highest preference**: For items not yet assigned, allocate them to the agent who values them the most.

Applying this strategy to the given table, we get the following allocation:

- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 0 (value = 94).
- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 7 (value = 83).
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 6 (value = 71).
- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 7 (value = 97).
- Item 4 is most valued by Agent 3 (value = 84).
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 2 (value = 88).
- Item 6 is most valued by Agent 2 (value = 91).
- Item 7 is most valued by Agent 4 (value = 57).
- Item 8 is most valued by Agent 2 (value = 95).

This allocation ensures that the items are distributed to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their preferences. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5, 6, 8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [1, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to one agent, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
