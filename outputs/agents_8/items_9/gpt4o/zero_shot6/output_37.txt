Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53   2   6  73  87  27  55   9  68
1  72  78  41  10  43  30  64  61  21
2  87  20   1  93  91  14  84  65  26
3  40  61  22  44  24  62  98  65  36
4  76  35  41  28  28   9  53  50  24
5  45  26  86  21  78  41  32   7  31
6   3  77  82  26  10  85  19   4  16
7  42   4  73  21  81  88  14  58  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a heuristic approach that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their valuations. Here's how we can proceed:

1. We need to assign exactly 9 items to 8 agents. This means one agent will get 2 items, and the rest will get 1 item each.

2. We start by finding the highest valuation for each agent and assign that item to them if it's still available.

3. For the agent with the second item, we can choose the next best available item based on the remaining unallocated items and their valuations.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item:
   - Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 87)
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 78)
   - Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 93)
   - Agent 3 gets item 6 (value 98)
   - Agent 4 gets item 0 (value 76)
   - Agent 5 gets item 2 (value 86)
   - Agent 6 gets item 5 (value 85)
   - Agent 7 gets item 8 (value 79)

2. With all agents having one item, allocate the remaining item to the agent with the next highest valuation:
   - The remaining item is item 7.
   - For item 7, the valuations are: 
     - Agent 0: 9
     - Agent 1: 61
     - Agent 2: 65
     - Agent 3: 65
     - Agent 4: 50
     - Agent 5: 7
     - Agent 6: 4
     - Agent 7: 58
   - Both agents 2 and 3 have the highest valuation of 65 for item 7. We can choose either based on tie-breaking preference or other criteria. Let's allocate it to agent 2.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated.
