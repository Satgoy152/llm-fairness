Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  89  39  70  10  19  53  16  43
1  58  66  27  21  69  73  44  85   3
2  19  87  70  42  63  55  81   9  15
3   1  41  20  47  22  43   5  47  87
4  92  24  12  93  44  69  33  70   9
5   8   7  50   2  27  69  62  53  66
6  79  38  21  72  27  25  11  76  93
7  23  92  80  57  22  95  36  64  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each.

Let's determine an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 1 (Value: 89)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 7 (Value: 85)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 6 (Value: 81)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 8 (Value: 87)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 3 (Value: 93)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 5 (Value: 69)
7. **Agent 6**: Item 4 (Value: 27)
8. **Agent 7**: Item 2 (Value: 80)

Now, we have allocated 8 out of 9 items. We need to allocate one more item to any agent. Let's allocate the remaining item with the highest unallocated value to an agent who would benefit most:

- Item 0 (Value: 28 for Agent 0) is left. Let's allocate it to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents while maximizing their total value.
