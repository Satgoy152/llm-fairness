Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  12  20  73   9  58   8  61  59
1   2  71  45  73  45  21  71  56  34
2  24  98  32  83  95  23  88  83  81
3   8  50   7  23  81  45  50  42  57
4  10  95  47  55  48  96  27  99   8
5  26  92  47  73  67  72  99  46  15
6  61  86  84  75   8  87  88   0  91
7  56   6  49  39  98  11  52  30  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and we should aim for a distribution that reflects the agents' valuations. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Identify the highest value each agent places on any item and allocate that item to the respective agent, provided it hasn't already been assigned to another agent.
2. If a tie occurs or an item has already been allocated, consider the next highest valuation for that agent or allocate based on an overall second preference.

Following this method:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation (73) for item 3. Allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation (73) for item 3, but it's already allocated. The second highest (71) is for item 1. Allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation (98) for item 1, but it's already allocated. The second highest (95) is for item 4. Allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation (81) for item 4, but it's already allocated. The second highest (57) is for item 8. Allocate item 8 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation (99) for item 7. Allocate item 7 to agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation (99) for item 6. Allocate item 6 to agent 5.
7. Agent 6 has the highest valuation (91) for item 8, but it's already allocated. The second highest (88) is for item 6, but it's already allocated. The next highest (87) is for item 5. Allocate item 5 to agent 6.
8. Agent 7 has the highest valuation (98) for item 4, but it's already allocated. The second highest (87) is for item 8, but it's already allocated. Allocate item 2 (49, as the next highest unallocated) to agent 7.
9. Item 0 remains unallocated. It can be given to agent 0, who doesn't have another item.

This allocation satisfies the criteria, distributing all nine items among the agents. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [2]
}
```
