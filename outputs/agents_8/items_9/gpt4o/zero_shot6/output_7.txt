Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  55  35  36  74  66  99  93  39
1  71  57  24  21  72  19   3  66  39
2  69  52   9  89  12  25  10  64  71
3  70  80  87  39  96  50  41  34  44
4  21  26  41  39  93  39  61  77  46
5  48  32  64  19  24  45  63  73  65
6  83  97  40  46  97   1  67   8  34
7  94   6   7  16  65  35  65  89  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. One way to do this is by sorting the items based on the highest valuation by any agent and assigning them accordingly. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - Item 0: Max value of 94 by Agent 7
   - Item 1: Max value of 97 by Agent 6
   - Item 2: Max value of 87 by Agent 3
   - Item 3: Max value of 89 by Agent 2
   - Item 4: Max value of 97 by Agent 6
   - Item 5: Max value of 66 by Agent 0
   - Item 6: Max value of 99 by Agent 0
   - Item 7: Max value of 93 by Agent 0
   - Item 8: Max value of 71 by Agent 2

2. **Allocate Items Based on Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 5, 6, and 7.
   - Agent 2 receives items 3 and 8.
   - Agent 3 receives item 2.
   - Agent 6 receives items 1 and 4.
   - Agent 7 receives item 0.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure each item is allocated, and no agent is omitted from the list.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [1, 4],
    "7": [0]
}
```
