Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  58  62  72  62  87  99  26  75
1  50  30  33  13  51  16  61  79   4
2  35  54  64  81  22  71  62  97  72
3  75  98  29  52  49  65  30  67  38
4  36  37  21  85  69  46  20  93  40
5  12  94  86  90  68  37  80  73  51
6  41  30   6   6   3   6  25  34  10
7  39  32  35  84   3  21  37   3  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items for which they have relatively high valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the total items available. Given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, each agent should ideally receive at least 1 item, and 1 agent will receive 2 items.

Here is one way to allocate the items based on maximizing individual valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuation is for item 6 (99).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 7 (79).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 3 (81).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuation is for item 1 (98).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuation is for item 7 (93) but it's taken; next is item 3 (85).
6. **Agent 5:** Highest valuation is for item 3 (90) but it's taken; next is item 1 (94).
7. **Agent 6:** Highest valuation is for item 0 (41).
8. **Agent 7:** Highest valuation is for item 3 (84) but it's taken; next is item 2 (35).

Now, re-evaluate and allocate based on the above preferences while ensuring no item is assigned twice:

- **Agent 0** gets item 6.
- **Agent 1** gets item 7.
- **Agent 2** gets item 3.
- **Agent 3** gets item 1.
- **Agent 4** gets item 8.
- **Agent 5** gets item 5.
- **Agent 6** gets item 0.
- **Agent 7** gets item 2.
  
One item remains unallocated (item 4), which can be assigned to the agent with the next highest valuation that hasn't already received an extra item. Agent 4 can take item 4 since they have a relatively high valuation for it, and it is still unallocated.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8, 4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [2]
}
```
