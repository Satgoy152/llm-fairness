Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  11   7  94  87  63  92  85  15
1   6  70  93  43  43  67  20  38  68
2  51  33   0  48  75  77  91  59  45
3  31  37  51  78  81  58  32  27  98
4   6  89  21  89  32  58  16   3   7
5  40  79  63  91  29  49  65  74  86
6  36   1   0  79  18  30  38  22  24
7  71  49  85  38  74  88  11  98  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. While doing this, we must ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that exactly 9 items are allocated in total. 

Given the constraint that each agent can get an integer number of items, we can try to allocate one or a few items to agents who value them highly so that the overall allocation is fair and maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high value for items 0 (95), 3 (94), and 6 (92).
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 (93) highly.
3. **Agent 2** can take item 5 (77) which is among the highest valued for this agent.
4. **Agent 3** values item 8 (98) the most.
5. **Agent 4** does not have any highly unique maximum values compared to others, so they can be left without an item in this allocation.
6. **Agent 5** can take item 7 (74), which is one of their higher values.
7. **Agent 6** does not have any high unique maximum values and can be left without an item.
8. **Agent 7** can take item 1 (49) and item 4 (74).

This allocation considers the highest values for each agent while ensuring all 9 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [],
    "7": [1, 4]
}
```
