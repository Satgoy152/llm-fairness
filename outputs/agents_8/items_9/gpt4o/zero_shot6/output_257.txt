Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  39  15  32  66  16  87  65  22
1   6  80   1  48  27  71  81  31   0
2  91  94   0  39  78  75  33  51  57
3   5  47  42  60  94  12  18  39  95
4  10  87  55  67  25  15  58  72  72
5  81  65  88  81  88  37  85  22  38
6  19  27  56  81  40  73  19  46  19
7  86  68  51  15  41   6  54  49   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction. However, since the problem does not specify the approach to fairness (e.g., maximizing total value, envy-freeness, etc.), I'll make a reasonable allocation based on maximizing the sum of values for each agent's selected items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 6, so give them item 6.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1, so give them item 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 1, but it is already taken, so give them item 0.
- Agent 3 highly values item 8, so give them item 8.
- Agent 4 highly values item 1, but it is already taken, so give them item 7.
- Agent 5 highly values item 2, so give them item 2.
- Agent 6 highly values item 5, so give them item 5.
- Agent 7 highly values item 0, but it is already taken, so give them item 3.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. We have not yet given out item 4. Since agent 0 has the highest value for item 4 among those without two items, give item 4 to agent 0.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
