Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  46  66  42  41  46  47  97  60
1  25  41   1  75  90  56  90  47  62
2  33  62  26  85  23  35  23  82   6
3  55  14   5  73  64   7   3  72  23
4   8  19  98  52  44  97  13  97  67
5  70  27  83  55  18  60   3  87  34
6  85  57  49  55  91  59  54  51  40
7  40  92  82  34  82  20  99  20  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each of the 9 items is allocated to one of the agents. We'll aim to distribute the items in a way that reflects the agents' valuations as closely as possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 7 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 5 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 6 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 7 values item 1 highly.
- Item 8 can be allocated to agent 1 as they value it fairly well compared to others.

With these considerations, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is given to the agent that has either the highest valuation or a reasonably high valuation for it. This approach aims to maximize overall happiness based on the given valuations.
