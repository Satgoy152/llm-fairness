Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  35  50  35  54  13  94  62  78
1   0   7   2  34   2  93  27  10  15
2  74  17  45  69  99  64  31  86  81
3  76  15  94  41  63  93  70  20  44
4  56   4  41  61  12  46  57  21  78
5   6  43  82  19  17  31  39  39  17
6  93  21  59  16  34  31  16   7  94
7  70  19   0   8  67  35  73   4  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, given there are 9 items and 8 agents. Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. 
2. If any agent is not assigned any item, re-evaluate the assignments to ensure everyone gets at least one item.

Based on the given valuations:

- Item 0 is most valued by agent 6 (value 93).
- Item 1 is most valued by agent 5 (value 43).
- Item 2 is most valued by agent 3 (value 94).
- Item 3 is most valued by agent 2 (value 69).
- Item 4 is most valued by agent 2 (value 99).
- Item 5 is most valued by agent 1 (value 93).
- Item 6 is most valued by agent 0 (value 94).
- Item 7 is most valued by agent 2 (value 86).
- Item 8 is most valued by agent 6 (value 94).

Let's allocate these items ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 gets item 6.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 2.
- Agent 4 gets no items (re-evaluate this).
- Agent 5 gets item 1.
- Agent 6 gets items 0 and 8.
- Agent 7 gets no items (re-evaluate this).

This allocation leaves agent 4 and agent 7 without any items, which we need to fix. Let's adjust:

- Reassign item 3 from agent 2 to agent 4.
- Reassign item 8 from agent 6 to agent 7.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [4, 7]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [3]
- Agent 5: [1]
- Agent 6: [0]
- Agent 7: [8]

Convert this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [8]
}
```
