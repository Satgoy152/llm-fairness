Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  28  99  49  57  24  37  67  38
1  69  78  35  69  50  78  21  10  41
2  68  82  62  36  91  71   8  39  10
3  12  28  93  71  86  62  83  43  25
4  66  99  72  41  19  21  39  11  23
5  76  22  62  40  11  36  15  51  98
6  64  61   6  42  80   3  39  14  76
7  23  21  19  38  70  50  68  73  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple rule where we try to maximize the total value of items each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Let's go through the process to allocate these items:

1. First, each agent should receive at least one item.
2. Then, distribute the remaining items to maximize the total valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for an unassigned item until each agent has at least one item.
- Distribute any remaining items to maximize the total valuation.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Item 2 – Highest valuation for unassigned item.
2. **Agent 1:** Item 1 – Highest valuation for unassigned item.
3. **Agent 2:** Item 4 – Highest valuation for unassigned item.
4. **Agent 3:** Item 3 – Highest valuation for unassigned item.
5. **Agent 4:** Item 0 – Highest valuation for unassigned item.
6. **Agent 5:** Item 8 – Highest valuation for unassigned item.
7. **Agent 6:** Item 6 – Highest valuation for unassigned item.
8. **Agent 7:** Item 5 – Highest valuation for unassigned item.
9. **Agent 3:** Item 7 – Next highest valuation for unassigned item.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while maximizing the total value. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [5]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with at least one item and ensures a fair distribution based on the values provided.
