Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  28  31  58  58  32  86   6  70
1  50  33  12   5  26   4  60  12   9
2  12   4  61  65  18  63   0  39  63
3  91  65  99  19  98  65  71  29  32
4  28  82  89  69  26  38  24  55  33
5  25  11   3  32  35  92  69  85  24
6  43  31  72  57  88  98   7  61  80
7  37  12  23  58  51  64   3   5  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated in total. A common approach is to try and maximize the satisfaction or total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets some items. Since we have 8 agents and 9 items, ideally one agent will have 2 items, and the rest will have 1 item each.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. **Item 0:** Highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 91.
2. **Item 1:** Highest valuation is by Agent 4 with 82.
3. **Item 2:** Highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 99 (Agent 3 gets this item too since they have the highest valuation for it).
4. **Item 3:** Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 58.
5. **Item 4:** Highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 98 (Agent 3 already has 2 items, next highest valuation is Agent 6 with 88).
6. **Item 5:** Highest valuation is by Agent 6 with 98 (Agent 6 gets this item too since they have the highest valuation for it).
7. **Item 6:** Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 86 (Agent 0 already has 1 item, next highest valuation is Agent 1 with 60).
8. **Item 7:** Highest valuation is by Agent 5 with 85.
9. **Item 8:** Highest valuation is by Agent 6 with 80 (Agent 6 already has 2 items, next highest valuation is Agent 0 with 70).

Let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3, Item 8
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: 
- Agent 3: Item 0, Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 1
- Agent 5: Item 7
- Agent 6: Item 4, Item 5
- Agent 7: 

Now, let's put this into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4, 5],
    "7": []
}
```
