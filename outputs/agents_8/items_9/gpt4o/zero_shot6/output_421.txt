Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  65  81  23   3  22   9  64  93
1  23  48  10  34  38  34  14  32  38
2  41  46   6  68  23   4  43  60  94
3  75  76   9  99  47   1  10  91  62
4   1   0  98  52  28  11  38  43  98
5  98  51  30  34  10  34  52  23  52
6  23   3  52  62  72  98  46   4  51
7  73  97  33  91  25  80  31  56  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that all 9 items are distributed while considering the agents' valuations for the items. A potential approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed step-by-step:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item:** For each item, find the agent who values it the most.
2. **Assign the item to that agent:** Allocate the item to the agent who values it the highest.
3. **Ensure all items are allocated:** Repeat the process until all items are distributed, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item if possible.

Following this strategy, here's the allocation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 5 values it the highest at 98.
- **Item 1:** Agent 7 values it the highest at 97.
- **Item 2:** Agent 4 values it the highest at 98.
- **Item 3:** Agent 3 values it the highest at 99.
- **Item 4:** Agent 6 values it the highest at 72.
- **Item 5:** Agent 6 values it the highest at 98.
- **Item 6:** Agent 5 values it the highest at 52.
- **Item 7:** Agent 3 values it the highest at 91.
- **Item 8:** Agent 2 values it the highest at 94.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [0, 6],
    "6": [4, 5],
    "7": [1]
}
```
