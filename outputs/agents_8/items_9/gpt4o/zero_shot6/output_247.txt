Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  36  80  10  43  84  50  32  72
1  53  58  75  64  50  70   1  17  73
2  72  63  69   1  73  23  80  23  38
3  31   8  95   4  30  76  11  56  53
4  52  51  45  60   3  54  31  95  70
5  47  41  22  38  83  60  11  51  71
6  10  76  65   7   0  89  71  11  51
7  69   5  11  30  73  96  23   7  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, with some agents potentially receiving no items at all. We'll distribute the items such that they are assigned to agents based on maximizing the agents' valuations while maintaining fairness.

Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are [23, 36, 80, 10, 43, 84, 50, 32, 72]
   - High valuation: Item 5 (84)

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are [53, 58, 75, 64, 50, 70, 1, 17, 73]
   - High valuation: Item 2 (75)

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are [72, 63, 69, 1, 73, 23, 80, 23, 38]
   - High valuation: Item 6 (80)

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are [31, 8, 95, 4, 30, 76, 11, 56, 53]
   - High valuation: Item 2 (95), but already taken, next: Item 5 (76)

5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are [52, 51, 45, 60, 3, 54, 31, 95, 70]
   - High valuation: Item 7 (95)

6. **Agent 5**: Valuations are [47, 41, 22, 38, 83, 60, 11, 51, 71]
   - High valuation: Item 4 (83)

7. **Agent 6**: Valuations are [10, 76, 65, 7, 0, 89, 71, 11, 51]
   - High valuation: Item 5 (89), but already taken, next: Item 1 (76)

8. **Agent 7**: Valuations are [69, 5, 11, 30, 73, 96, 23, 7, 27]
   - High valuation: Item 5 (96), but already taken, next: Item 4 (73), but already taken, next: Item 0 (69)

After assigning high-value items to each agent, we must ensure all items are distributed:

- Items assigned: 5, 2, 6, 5, 7, 4, 1, 0
- Items left: 3, 8 (total 2 items)

Now distribute remaining items:
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1, who has a good valuation for it.
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 0, who has a decent valuation for it.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [0]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives the items based on their highest preference possible while distributing all 9 items among the agents fairly.
