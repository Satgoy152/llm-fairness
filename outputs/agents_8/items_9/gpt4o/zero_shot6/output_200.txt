Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  58  84  89  10  93  70  62   8
1  10  73  51  55  92  12  82  23  39
2  87  77  91  42  19  49   5  53   7
3  68  67  43  19  89  93  73  18  88
4  30  33  27  47  15  27  29  16  43
5  50  24  81  35  61  39  61  15  30
6  35   2  99  73  13  74   7  89  83
7  92  30  13  27  84  42  90   9   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a simple allocation strategy where each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives. One way to achieve this is by iteratively assigning the highest available value to an agent that hasn't reached the average value cap yet. Hereâ€™s how it can be done:

1. Calculate the average number of items per agent: Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, each agent should ideally get about 1.125 items. Practically, this means some agents will get 1 item and some 2 items.

2. Sort each agent's valuations to determine the most valued items for each agent.

3. Allocate items by assigning the highest available valued item to the agent that values it the most until each agent has an acceptable number of items.

Following this method, here's a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [0, 1, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 5, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 5 gets item 6.
- Agent 6 gets item 8.
- Agent 7, with the highest value for items 0 and 1, also gets item 7 due to available items.
- Agent 4 does not get any item, as all items are distributed at this point.

This distribution ensures all 9 items are allocated, and each agent's allocation tries to maximize their individual valuations.
