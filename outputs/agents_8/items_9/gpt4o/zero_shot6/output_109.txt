Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  47  19  83  93  18  50  60  53
1   5  59  59  20  34  68  84  45  46
2  97  91  23  63  87  27  52   9  36
3  51  69  10  99   8  32  56  95  44
4  65   4  61  81  99   7   5  64  50
5  38  89  76  34  75  35  88  18  84
6  60  98  29  84  21  80  45  88  42
7  96  77  16   5  20  20  90  38  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their valuation while distributing the items as evenly as possible. Given there are 8 agents and 9 items, most agents will receive one item, and one agent will receive two items.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (value 93).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 6 (value 84).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 0 (value 97).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 3 (value 99).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 4 (value 99), but item 4 is already taken, so we consider item 3 (value 81), but it is also taken, so we consider item 2 (value 61).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 6 (value 88), but it is taken, so we consider item 8 (value 84).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value is for item 1 (value 98).
8. **Agent 7**: Highest value is for item 0 (value 96), but it is taken, so we consider item 6 (value 90), but it is also taken, so we consider item 1 (value 77).

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 2.
- Agent 5 gets item 8.
- Agent 6 gets item 1.
- Agent 7 currently has no item. We look to give the remaining item to agent 7.

Since item 5 is still available, we can assign item 5 to agent 7.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [5]
}
```
