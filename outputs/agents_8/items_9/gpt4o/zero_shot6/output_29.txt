Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  78  46  84  38  82  71  85  81
1  62  77  42  54  74  65  21  35  12
2  48  98   1  56  62  61  63  34   9
3  33  61  31  94  93   0  13   4  80
4  10  17  36  57  38  95  39  85  27
5  68  15  63  18  66  43  92  90  63
6  40  46  83  17  81  81  80  22  73
7  62  69  45  94  29  90  82  78  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. We will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution is fair based on their valuations.

Let's assign the items based on maximizing the individual agent's valuation for an item while ensuring a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations on items 3, 7, and 5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations on items 4, 8, and 3. Since item 3 is already assigned, assign item 8 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation on item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5** has a high valuation on items 6 and 7. Assign item 6 to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6** has high valuations on items 2 and 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 6.
8. **Agent 7** has high valuations on items 3 and 5. Since these are already assigned, assign item 7 to Agent 7.
9. The remaining item 2 can be assigned to Agent 7, who has a relatively good valuation for it.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent has received at least one item.
