Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  38  96  38  81  87  98  20  76
1  34  59  52  85  44  25   0  42  19
2  82  18  95  89   6  33   0  12  56
3  89  92  93  22  50   1  39  20  98
4   1   4  65  78  40   3  31  70  86
5  42   8  78  39  20  55  87  90  40
6  75  64  74  92  48  61   8  57  41
7  89  16  13  73  28  70  46  16  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should try to maximize each agent's total valuation for their assigned items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, as we have exactly 8 agents and 9 items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate each agent's highest valuation for an item and assign that item to them if it hasn't been allocated yet. This ensures each agent gets at least one item they value highly.
2. Distribute the remaining items by maximizing the remaining unallocated item's value for agents who have fewer items.

Let's go through the agents and assign items:

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 6 (value: 98)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (value: 85)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (value: 95)
- Agent 3: Item 8 (value: 98)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (value: 70)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (value: 55)
- Agent 6: Item 3 is already taken, go for Item 6 (value: 61) but already taken, assign Item 0 (value: 75)
- Agent 7: Item 0 is already taken, go for Item 3 (value: 73) but already taken, assign Item 5 (value: 70) but already taken, assign Item 4 (value: 28)

### Remaining Items:
- Item 1 is unallocated.

### Assign the Remaining Item:
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 5, as it increases his total value most significantly.

Now ensure the allocation is even, and no agent is left with zero items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5, 1],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [4]
}
```

Each agent has received at least one item, and all 9 items have been allocated.
