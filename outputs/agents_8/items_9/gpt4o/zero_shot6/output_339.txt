Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  60   9  85  76  99  18  17  52
1  78  47  60  61  19  91  45  17  96
2  92  38  93  53   0  89  25  60  89
3  67  77  71  95  23  33  33   6  20
4   1  94   7  57   1  28  55  76   8
5  79  91  99  62   4  51  29  71   3
6  23  98  87  28  31  31  18  54  78
7  93  95  76  55  95   0  97  63  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to distribute them such that each agent ends up with at least one item, if possible, and the items are distributed in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** 
   - Compute the total value each agent would have if they received their top-valued items. This helps in understanding which items are most desired by each agent.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that every agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust to Ensure Fair Distribution:**
   - Redistribute items if necessary to ensure that each agent has at least one item, while keeping the allocations as fair as possible in terms of total value.

Based on these steps, here's a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [4]
}
```

This allocation is designed to ensure each agent gets an item, and items are allocated to agents who value them highly. Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items sums to 9.
