Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  25  40  82  36  73  92  67  90
1  46  65  55  56  83  52  38  81  82
2  60  33  86  24  95  87  45  74  61
3  80  70  97   1  48  88  55  64  72
4  32  69  40  13  72  47  14  93  62
5  56  18  47  53  81  27  29  95  14
6  68  10  55  41  92  74  82   2  62
7  37  29  76   1  44  21  16  15  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple approach to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while distributing all items.

Here is the step-by-step allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and allocate that item to the agent with the highest valuation for it.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible and try to balance the allocations.

Using this heuristic, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 0 (82)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 4 (69)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 3 (97)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 0 (82)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 2 (95)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 3 (88)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (92)
- Item 7: Highest value by Agent 4 (93)
- Item 8: Highest value by Agent 0 (90)

Now, we can adjust the allocations to ensure fairness and distribution:

- Agent 0 has too many items. We can reallocate items 3 and 6 to other agents with high valuations.
- Give Item 3 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation).
- Give Item 6 to Agent 6 (third-highest valuation).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [1, 7],
    "5": [],
    "6": [6],
    "7": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agents with higher valuations receive more items, while trying to balance the distribution.
