Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  30  77  20  83  76  62   7  86
1  51  13  98  16  79  66  34  51   0
2   6  21  65  18  68  73  26  17  88
3  26  75  70  61  49  55   1  16  75
4  15  35  38  46  88   3  70  36  43
5  61  61  49  28   5  43  76  14  44
6   9  25  76   4  86  60   2  78  54
7   6   8  86  75  15  99  25  69  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a similar total value, considering their respective valuations. Here's a potential allocation that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Has relatively high valuations for items 0, 4, and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Values items 5 and 8 highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 highly.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 4 and some moderate values.
6. **Agent 5**: Moderate values for items, but no high peaks.
7. **Agent 6**: Values item 7 highly.
8. **Agent 7**: Highly values item 5.

Given these observations, here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 3 and item 6 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 6.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 7.

Now, let's format this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3, 6],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items is nine.
