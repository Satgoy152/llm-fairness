Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  49  95  19  14  33  75   1  55
1  58  63  32  83  55  48  51  11  68
2  32   0  69  89  99  97  39  51  18
3  27  38  89  29  47  16  63  97  83
4  61  90  83  82  22  99  18  68  73
5  53  24  27  47  32  35  50  45  77
6  88  12  64   4  27  22  86   4  59
7  18  76  54  16  38  73  84  61  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuations each agent gets from their allocated items. We will start by considering the highest valued items for each agent and allocate them accordingly while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, and no agent receives more than 2 items (to ensure fairness and distribution across agents).

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 6. Allocate items 2 and 6 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 3. Allocate items 1 and 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4 and item 5. Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 7. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 0. Allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has a moderate valuation for item 8 but as it is the last unallocated item, allocate item 8 to Agent 5.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets items based on high valuations while keeping the distribution fair.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [],
    "7": []
}
```
