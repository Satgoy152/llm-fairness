Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  75  41  46  61  15  38  24  12
1  55  54  86  79  42  66  76  66  43
2  99  43  39  76  95  31  66  51  64
3   8  56   1  56  29  99  10  18  22
4  48   6  56  98  40  40  76  88  17
5  42  68  80  48  84  88   1  22  48
6  14  67   0   8  40  48  58   8  35
7  75  18   0  27  42   5  35  78  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can follow a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent can get. Given there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, while the rest will receive 1 item each.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 1 values item 2 the most (value of 86).
2. Agent 3 values item 5 the most (value of 99).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (value of 99).
4. Agent 4 values item 3 the most (value of 98).
5. Agent 5 values item 6 the most (value of 88).
6. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (value of 75).
7. Agent 7 values item 7 the most (value of 78).
8. Agent 6 values item 8 the most (value of 35).

Given this approach, each agent gets their highest valued item, and the total number of items allocated is 8. To allocate the remaining item fairly, we can give an additional item to one of the agents based on their next highest value:

9. Agent 1 can also receive item 4 (value of 42) as it complements their existing allocation and ensures all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [7]
}
```
