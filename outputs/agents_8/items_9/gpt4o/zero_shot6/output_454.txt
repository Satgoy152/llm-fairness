Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  59  29  31  40  24  48  79  83
1   7  12   4  37  94  71  18  47  29
2  87  36  86  93  57  45  95  46  76
3  27   8  92   7  18  90  75  12  86
4   2   5  37  42  93  40  94  53  47
5  39  14  55  16  44  68  12  96  33
6  48  83  28  30  83  74  91  73  99
7  97  99  47  95  69  64  44  51  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the problem of fairly allocating the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets as close to an equal share of the total value as possible. Given the valuations provided in the table, we can use a greedy approach to allocate items to the agents such that the overall distribution is as fair as possible.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Sort the items based on their value for each agent.
3. Allocate items to agents starting from the agent with the highest total value down to the lowest, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items in a way that attempts to balance the total value they receive, given their individual valuations.
