Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  65  39  83  41  35  56  17  39
1  52  89  11  48  66  59  53  45  14
2  15  12  81  40  36  11  52  55   9
3  84  42   4  77  59  11   5  99  69
4  95  60  48   0  81  66  67  53  62
5  50  29  98  82  34  42  65  85  75
6  83   5  59   0  50  20  64  80  81
7  86  12  70  32  11  48  79  38  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can try to balance the total valuations for each agent across their allocated items. We will distribute the items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives, ensuring that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's calculate a fair allocation of the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0: Allocate items 0 and 2 (total value = 63 + 39 = 102)
2. Agent 1: Allocate items 1 and 4 (total value = 89 + 66 = 155)
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 3 (total value = 40)
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 7 (total value = 99)
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 8 (total value = 62)
6. Agent 5: Allocate item 5 (total value = 42)
7. Agent 6: Allocate item 6 (total value = 64)
8. Agent 7: No items allocated

This distribution attempts to maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring that each item's total allocation is fair.

Here is the allocation represented in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": []
}
```
