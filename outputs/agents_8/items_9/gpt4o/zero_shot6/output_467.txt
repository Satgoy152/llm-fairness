Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  19  23  17  53  61   4  67  46
1  67  34  10  38  92  47  31  15  42
2  39  17  29  97   6  39  31   3  37
3  70  65  33  34  64  42  45  67  80
4  40  72  49  98  31  31  64  44  97
5  74  71   9  17  48  35  64  92  56
6   0  17  94   4  47  71  59  39  85
7  18  88  72  56   1  16  34  38  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Assign items to agents by highest value**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most and allocate it to that agent.

2. **Ensure fairness**: Adjust the allocations if necessary to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items while maximizing the total valuation.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 5 (value 74).
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 7 (value 88).
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 6 (value 94).
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 4 (value 98).
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 1 (value 92).
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 0 (value 61).
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 45).
- Item 7 is valued highest by agent 5 (value 92).
- Item 8 is valued highest by agent 3 (value 80).

After assigning the items based on the highest valuation, we have the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0, 7],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent's allocation is based on maximizing their valuations.
