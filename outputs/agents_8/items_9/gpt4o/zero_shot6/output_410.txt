Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  53  73  26  88  49  33  53  65
1  79  36  71  99  93  51  82  39   2
2  89  91  89  10  33  28  62  77  87
3  88  88  96  51  59  85  34  87  83
4   5  29  73   7  88   8  27  43  19
5  16  96  21  25  65  76  94  32  27
6  93  32  27  72  70  75  66  89   0
7  63  51  74  83  61  57  49  34   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that balances the overall value each agent receives. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each. Here's one possible allocation that attempts to maximize fairness based on the provided valuations:

1. Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 94).
2. Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 99).
3. Agent 2 gets item 1 (value 91).
4. Agent 3 gets items 2 and 7 (values 96 and 87).
5. Agent 4 gets item 4 (value 88).
6. Agent 5 gets item 5 (value 76).
7. Agent 6 gets item 6 (value 66).
8. Agent 7 gets item 8 (value 6).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, with agent 3 receiving two items. Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [8]
}
```
