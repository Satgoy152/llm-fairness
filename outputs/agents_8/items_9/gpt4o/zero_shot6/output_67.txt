Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  26  54  20  86  22  49  81  77
1  93  59  98  26  21  87  66  86  20
2  42  88  63  16  58  83  49  79  71
3   8   1   2   6  23  19  53  29  43
4  86   9  30  81  39  56   9  54  42
5   9  92  27  10  15  77  70  39  84
6   7  60  13  77  24  96  20  27   6
7  97  63  65  69  99  81  99  52  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a relatively balanced total value of items, considering that each agent's valuation of the items varies.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by identifying the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no two agents get the same item.
3. If some items remain unallocated, assign them to agents with the least total value so far to balance the allocations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 4 (value 86).
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 2 (value 98).
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 1 (value 88).
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 6 (value 53).
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 0 (value 86).
6. Agent 5: Allocate item 8 (value 84).
7. Agent 6: Allocate item 5 (value 96).
8. Agent 7: Allocate item 7 (value 52).

Now, we have allocated 8 items. We need to allocate one more item. We will assign item 3 to Agent 7, as it provides a decent value and balances the overall distribution.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has at least one item, except Agent 7, who has two items.
