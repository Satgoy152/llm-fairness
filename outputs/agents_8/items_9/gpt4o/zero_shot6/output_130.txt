Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  59  73  39   8  35  49   3  43
1  43  87  85  20  14   3  81  36  67
2  99  23  16  98  13  80  68   6  92
3  38  38   7  34  86  96  25  91  72
4  86   3  83  64  60  37  87  85   5
5  51  95  58  46  24  46  17  38  17
6  97  63  79  33  59  32  65  63   0
7  93  46  64  43  53  57  50  59  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations until all items have been allocated. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 2 has the highest valuation of 99 for item 0, so assign item 0 to agent 2.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation of 87 for item 1, so assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 1 also has a high valuation of 85 for item 2, so assign item 2 to agent 1.
4. Agent 2 has a high valuation of 98 for item 3, so assign item 3 to agent 2.
5. Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 96 for item 5, so assign item 5 to agent 3.
6. Agent 4 has the highest valuation of 87 for item 6, so assign item 6 to agent 4.
7. Agent 3 has the highest remaining valuation of 91 for item 7, so assign item 7 to agent 3.
8. Agent 2 has a high valuation of 92 for item 8, so assign item 8 to agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0, 3, 8],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [],
    "7": []
}
```
