Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  32  39  38  27  12  30  13  46
1  23  84  35  39  83  58  51  85  61
2  78  40  77  91  63  53  23  35  48
3  96  69  83  74  12  14  64  28  11
4  20  88  22  42  39  49  12   8  85
5  85  51  65  42  71  81  78  82  32
6  67  80  35  34  85  60  47   1   3
7   9  34  35   5  98  46  80  80  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that exactly 9 items are allocated in total. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that considers the valuations and aims for a balanced allocation.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying each agent's highest valued items and ensuring each agent receives at least one high-valued item if possible.
2. Distribute remaining items by considering the next highest valued items for each agent, aiming for a balanced distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 0
- Agent 1 receives items: 1
- Agent 2 receives items: 3
- Agent 3 receives items: 2
- Agent 4 receives items: 8
- Agent 5 receives items: 5, 6
- Agent 6 receives items: 4
- Agent 7 receives items: 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed.

The JSON format of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5, 6],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [7]
}
```
