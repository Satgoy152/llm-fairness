Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  32  77  58  51  15  12  49  61
1  59  80  73  16  22  68  39  28  41
2  28  56  30   9  86  52  32  91  57
3  92  80  61  82  93  19  48  16  23
4  37  23  91  88  21   5  39  50  79
5  13   9  88  97  45  92  77  71  93
6  94  32  46  34  58  25  72  51  73
7  58  57  53  34  34   7  37   0  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9, and each agent gets at least one item. Here, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation from the items they receive, ensuring a fair distribution based on their preferences.

Given the constraints, let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0 gets items 0 and 2.
2. Agent 1 gets item 1.
3. Agent 2 gets items 4 and 7.
4. Agent 3 gets item 3.
5. Agent 4 gets item 8.
6. Agent 5 gets item 5.
7. Agent 6 gets item 6.
8. Agent 7 gets no items.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item, except for Agent 7, who receives none due to the constraints and valuation preferences.

Now, I will present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": []
}
```
