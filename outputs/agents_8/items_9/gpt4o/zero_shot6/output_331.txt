Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  12  12  58  41   3  57  80  46
1  90  35  87  40  21   2  54  47  22
2  57  52  30  36  39  87   7  75  50
3   2  16  49  71  47   8  24  42  44
4  70  11  64  74  90   0  81  62  50
5  41   7  59  14   6  26  21   5   5
6  35  59  33  95  13  62  19  93  40
7  21  89  74  45  20  30  46  76   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items equals 9. A possible way to achieve this is to consider the highest valuations each agent has for different items and allocate accordingly while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 0, as they have the highest valuation for it.
2. Agent 1 receives item 2, as they have the highest valuation for it.
3. Agent 2 receives item 5, as they have the highest valuation for it.
4. Agent 3 receives item 3, as they have the highest valuation for it.
5. Agent 4 receives item 4, as they have the highest valuation for it.
6. Agent 5 receives item 6, as their valuation for it is relatively high among unchosen items.
7. Agent 6 receives item 7, as they have the second-highest valuation for it.
8. Agent 7 receives item 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.
9. Agent 7 also receives item 8, as they have some valuation for it and it ensures all items are allocated.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [1, 8]
}
```
