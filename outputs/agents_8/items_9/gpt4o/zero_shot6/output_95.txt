Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  27  17  89  21  52  10  61  62
1  59  14  86  11  29  66  42  95  56
2  82  52   8  70  45  39  76  13  60
3  12  57  43  70  37  22  88  16  24
4  16  59  18  82  83  10  33  44  45
5  26  49  70  28   2  76  83   4  89
6  69   6  62  69  53  51   8  73  14
7  88  61  50  47  59  67  56  43  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the 9 items such that the allocations consider the valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least some items. Given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive an additional item compared to others.

A balanced way to do this is to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, with one agent receiving two items. We can prioritize allocations based on the relative values each agent assigns to the items, trying to maximize the total value for each agent's allocated items.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest value each agent gives to any unassigned item.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. Allocate an additional item to one agent based on remaining unassigned items and their valuations.

Using this approach, here's a potential allocation:

Agent 0: Gets item 3 (value 89)
Agent 1: Gets item 7 (value 95)
Agent 2: Gets item 0 (value 82)
Agent 3: Gets item 6 (value 88)
Agent 4: Gets item 4 (value 83)
Agent 5: Gets item 8 (value 89)
Agent 6: Gets item 5 (value 51)
Agent 7: Gets items 1 and 2 (values 61 and 50)

Now we present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [1, 2]
}
```
