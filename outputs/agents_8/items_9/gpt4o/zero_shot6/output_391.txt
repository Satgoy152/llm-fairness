Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  66   9   0  18  60  29  46  14
1  34   5  32  24  24  52  84  74  57
2  45  32  91  64  85  90  24   9  45
3  46  10   3   4  56  92  75  60  68
4   6  56  22  49  95  63  52  81  10
5  53  50  72  65  72  63  37  15  50
6  22  93   0  69  69  25  71  99  66
7  53  13   9  63  17  10  41  36  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets as close to an equal share of total value as possible. Given there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items combined.
2. Distribute items to maximize each agent's total value received, while ensuring every agent gets at least one item.

Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has relatively high values for items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 5.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 5 and 2 highly.
- Agent 6 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 7 has relatively high values for item 0.

Allocating based on these considerations:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [3]
- Agent 6: [7]
- Agent 7: [0, 8]

By giving Agent 7 two items, we ensure that all 9 items are allocated and each agent receives at least 1 item. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [0, 8]
}
```
