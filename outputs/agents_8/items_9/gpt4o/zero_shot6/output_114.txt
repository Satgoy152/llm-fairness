Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  77  72  58  90  29  26  40  18
1  72  72   0  76  88  76  69   1  52
2  25  15  93  94  17  73  26  85  25
3  18  42  86  37  49  84  13  87  27
4  31  37  44  90  41  30  79  17   0
5  34  24  31  40  36  84  43  58  22
6  55  57  72  19  67  81  64   8  36
7  34  56  18  56  76  39  51  61  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method where each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most. This ensures that each agent gets the items they value highly, resulting in a fair distribution.

Let's go through the items one by one and allocate them based on the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (72).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (77).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (93).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (94).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (90).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by agent 3 and agent 5 (84 each). Assign it to agent 3 for this case.
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by agent 4 (79).
8. **Item 7**: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (87).
9. **Item 8**: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (52).

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item by re-evaluating the allocation if necessary. Here's a potential fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [],
    "6": [],
    "7": []
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets at least one item, except for agents 5, 6, and 7, who have lower valuations across all items compared to the others. However, the allocation is fair based on the highest value each agent assigns to the items they receive.
