Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  75  27  83  97  43  42  56  38
1   1  16  17  25  88   3  65  39  83
2  75  81  20  80  39  19  88  42   5
3  23  48  79  42  36  26  55  45  23
4  14  25  85  56  44  85   6  30  72
5  83   0   1  76  19  98  85   5  94
6  12  49  44  98  15  52  33  37   1
7  52  93   3  94  50  29  20  10  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all 9 items are distributed. The challenge is to make sure each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
2. Agent 1 values item 8 highly.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 6.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 5.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 7.
7. Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 3.
8. Agent 7 has a high valuation for item 1.

Considering these points, a possible allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Item 8
- Agent 2: Items 0, 6
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 5
- Agent 5: Item 7
- Agent 6: 
- Agent 7: Item 1

This allocation distributes all 9 items fairly, considering the highest valuations for each agent. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [],
    "7": [1]
}
```
