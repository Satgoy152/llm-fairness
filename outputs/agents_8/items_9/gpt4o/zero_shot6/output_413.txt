Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  68  90   3  89  94  91  98  58
1  53  20  27  38  70  14  32  76  69
2  33  81  25  36  37  46  16  42  80
3  55  46  37  28  86  80  12   7  25
4  70  87  86   4  72  88  45  69  88
5  32  99  96  23  71  79  27  48  46
6  23  54  68  53  22  75  28  12  47
7  24  67  29  22  77  66   1  23  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach where each agent receives at least one item, ensuring all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent one item based on their highest valuation to ensure fairness.
2. Distribute the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here's the allocation process:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 7 (value 98).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 4 (value 70).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 1 (value 81).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 4 (value 86) but it's taken, so item 5 (value 80).
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 5 (value 88) but it's taken, so item 8 (value 88).
- Agent 5 has the highest value for item 1 (value 99) but it's taken, so item 2 (value 96).
- Agent 6 has the highest value for item 5 (value 75) but it's taken, so item 3 (value 53).
- Agent 7 has the highest value for item 4 (value 77) but it's taken, so item 0 (value 24).

Now, let's finalize the allocation and ensure all items are covered:

- Items 6 hasn't been allocated yet. Allocate it to Agent 0 since it gives the next highest value (91).

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
