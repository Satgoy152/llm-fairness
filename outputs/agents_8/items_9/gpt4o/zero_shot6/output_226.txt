Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  56  11  25  46  10  19  17  83
1  24  81  84  59  31  37  99  57  75
2  50  56  72  93  43   4  57  73   5
3  30  34  30  95  73  94  55  87  43
4  65  51  67  29  68  32  49  42   3
5   1  41  97  32  95  45  26  25  23
6  10  28  48  22  70  16  78  65  51
7  68   5  22  32  93  75  36  29  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider how to distribute the 9 items in a way that respects the preferences of each agent as indicated by their valuations. The goal is to ensure that every agent has a fair share of items, considering the total value they perceive. Here is a proposed allocation:

1. Assign each agent at least one item, focusing on maximizing their total valuation for the items they receive.
2. Ensure that exactly 9 items are distributed among the agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 8
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Agent 5: Item 2
- Agent 6: Item 7
- Agent 7: Item 0, Item 1

This allocation considers that each agent receives a fair distribution based on their preferences. Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [0, 1]
}
```
