Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74   5  98  39  21  48  89  10  69
1  45  78  36  30  76  74  64  95  68
2  47  55  48  33  52  25  50  66  79
3  95  24  79  45   8  75  15  46  83
4  50  35  36  39  42  22  18  98  16
5  86  44  26  56  12  72  52  87   7
6  93   9  91  95  14  79  33  27  97
7  81  48   2  79  38  75  23  31   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that exactly 9 items are allocated in total across all agents.

Let's approach this step by step:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: For a fair allocation, we could start by distributing the items based on the highest value each agent places on any available item.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: We allocate the items to the agents who value them the highest. We will iterate over the list of items, assigning each to the agent who values it the most and hasn't been allocated that item yet.

3. **Ensure fairness**: Ensure that every agent gets a reasonable share of items and no items are left out.

Given the nature of the problem, let's proceed with allocating items:

- **Allocate item 0**: Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 95.
- **Allocate item 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 78.
- **Allocate item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 98.
- **Allocate item 3**: Agent 6 values item 3 the highest at 95.
- **Allocate item 4**: Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 76.
- **Allocate item 5**: Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 48.
- **Allocate item 6**: Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 89.
- **Allocate item 7**: Agent 4 values item 7 the highest at 98.
- **Allocate item 8**: Agent 6 values item 8 the highest at 97.

This leads to the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [],
    "6": [3, 8],
    "7": []
}
```

Each agent is included in the allocation, even if no items are assigned to them, to meet the requirement of having each agent represented in the JSON object.
