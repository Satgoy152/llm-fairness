Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  20  36  68  13  78  84  67  23
1  52  67  94   9   9   2  85  96  87
2  38  28  67  85   4  53  40  79  63
3  38  52  73  62  45  95  50  13  84
4  18  35  67  82  84  54  63  74  70
5  51  18  64   2   3  51  76  87  29
6   4  66  38  65  86  75  79  93  99
7  11  73  36  41  28  73  95  47  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one item each.

Here's a potential allocation strategy based on the values provided:

1. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 7.
2. Agent 2 has a relatively high value for item 3.
3. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 5.
4. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 4.
5. Agent 5 has a relatively high value for item 6.
6. Agent 6 has the highest value for item 8.
7. Agent 7 has the highest value for item 1.
8. Agent 0 can take item 0, and since it needs another item, can also take item 2.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their top preferences while ensuring all 9 items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [1]
}
```
