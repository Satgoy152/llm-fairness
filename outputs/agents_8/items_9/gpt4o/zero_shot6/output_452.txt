Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  30  50  61  52  62  98  14  98
1  65  11  63  21  99  71  11  76  80
2  25   4  71  51  57  73  11  33  88
3  77  67  77  37  36   5  57  47  40
4  13  85  17  32  31  27   1  60  29
5  67  73  23  34  73  87  41  41  32
6  28  38  26  20  13  50  30  63  15
7  23  42  52  54  76   7  65  22  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Since there are 8 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Our goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's preferences based on their valuations.

Below is one fair allocation of items to agents:

- Agent 0 receives item 6 (value 98) and item 8 (value 98).
- Agent 1 receives item 4 (value 99).
- Agent 2 receives item 5 (value 73).
- Agent 3 receives item 0 (value 77).
- Agent 4 receives item 1 (value 85).
- Agent 5 receives item 3 (value 34).
- Agent 6 receives item 7 (value 63).
- Agent 7 receives item 2 (value 52).

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [2]
}
```
