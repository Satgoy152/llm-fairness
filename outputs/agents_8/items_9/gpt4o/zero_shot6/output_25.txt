Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  50  33   1  42  96  35  84  79
1  26  77  99  70  34  11  37  45  82
2  11  67  32  30  46  16  38  47  64
3  46  81  99  21  81  60  10  87  28
4  94  25  73  37  43  23  11  43  95
5  38   8  26  33  31  66  23  98  70
6  84  53  26  22  74  39  74  32  61
7   5  68   4  61  64  93  16  24  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items based on the given valuations, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent, while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. First, let's calculate the optimal allocation based on the values given:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 5 (value 96) and 7 (value 84).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 2 (value 99).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 8 (value 64).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 2 (value 99), but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 7 (value 87).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 8 (value 95), but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 0 (value 94).
6. **Agent 5**: The highest value is for item 7 (value 98), but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 5 (value 66).
7. **Agent 6**: The highest values are for items 0 and 4 (both value 74), but item 0 is taken, so we choose item 4.
8. **Agent 7**: The highest value is for item 5 (value 93), but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 8 (value 81).

Adjusting for conflicts and ensuring all items are allocated:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 5.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 6.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 7.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 can take another item).

Now, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [6]
}
```
