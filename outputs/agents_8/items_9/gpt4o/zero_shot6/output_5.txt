Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  11  87  74  75  66  59  31  78
1  17  16  62  59  81   2  26  95  15
2  86  75  80  78  71  45  74  29   3
3  86  58  98  32  10  19  72  75   9
4  74  65   2  64  36  24  25   8  53
5   5  51  91  43  95  91  66  51  93
6  10  48  61  17  97   0  96  29   5
7   1   5  85  61  61  88  61  92  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that no agent feels significantly undervalued or overvalued compared to others. Given the constraints, let's proceed with an equitable allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are highest for item 0 (99), item 2 (87), and item 4 (75).
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are highest for item 4 (81), item 7 (95).
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are highest for item 0 (86), item 2 (80).
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are highest for item 2 (98), item 6 (72).
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are highest for item 0 (74).
6. **Agent 5**: Valuations are highest for item 4 (95), item 2 (91).
7. **Agent 6**: Valuations are highest for item 4 (97).
8. **Agent 7**: Valuations are highest for item 7 (92), item 8 (89).

Based on this, a fair allocation can be:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (as they have fewer high-value options).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (decent valuation and to balance allocation).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 6 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 5 (second highest value).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (second highest value).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 7 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 7 (second highest value).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item that they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.
