Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  93   0  77  90  77  40  29  79
1  55  61  95  28  44  95  19  54  73
2  17  14  24  32  90  73  13  76  67
3  19  22  66  15  36  59   8  13  51
4  95  98  77   6  96  75  22  55  91
5  18  79  49  32  85  77  39  40  80
6  29  66   9   5  81  95  39  12  84
7  42  18  74  77  67  29  81  60  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. This type of problem can be approached by considering each agent's highest valued items and trying to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. However, given there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent may receive more than one item.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Items 0 and 1 (Values: 87, 93)
2. Agent 1: Item 2 (Value: 95)
3. Agent 2: Item 3 (Value: 32)
4. Agent 3: Item 6 (Value: 8)
5. Agent 4: Item 4 (Value: 96)
6. Agent 5: Item 8 (Value: 80)
7. Agent 6: Item 5 (Value: 95)
8. Agent 7: Item 7 (Value: 60)

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 8 agents, with agents receiving items they value highly.
