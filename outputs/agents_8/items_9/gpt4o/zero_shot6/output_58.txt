Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  72  99  58  45  16  70  34   6
1  95  60  89  83  88  24  86   7  79
2  12  57  40  66  20  24   8  11  49
3  43  63  69  46  89   1  98  28  10
4  65  10  36  10  21  27  10  87  72
5  36  91  26  48  49   5  33  66  49
6  92  73  29  82  22  88  35  47  64
7   7  12  98   7   6  23  44  41  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. We also need to make sure that all 9 items are allocated to one of the agents. Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
- Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 3 has high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 4 has high valuation for item 7.
- Agent 5 has relatively high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 6 has relatively high valuation for item 8.
- Agent 7 has high valuation for item 2, but itâ€™s already taken, so we will not allocate any items to agent 7 in this allocation.

Based on these considerations, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [8],
    "7": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to exactly one agent, and all agents are accounted for in the list.
