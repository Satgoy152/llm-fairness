Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  18  16  98  40  24  38  77  15
1  77   6   1  31  67  64  41  80  75
2  96  40  83   6  57   8  16  54  54
3  78  29  15  25  91  79   0  61  38
4  80  68  13  16   5  10  93  13  67
5  39  50  92  51  44  97  47  30  31
6   1  52  40  72  79  63  65  32  80
7  90  27  33  33  53  81  22  69  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 9 items are distributed. One way to approach this problem is to try to maximize the total value for each agent while making sure that the distribution is as balanced as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3 (Value: 61 + 98 = 159)
- Agent 1: Items 7 and 1 (Value: 80 + 6 = 86)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (Value: 83)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (Value: 91)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (Value: 93)
- Agent 5: Item 5 (Value: 97)
- Agent 6: Item 8 (Value: 80)
- Agent 7: No items

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent and that we have distributed all 9 items. Below is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [8],
    "7": []
}
```
