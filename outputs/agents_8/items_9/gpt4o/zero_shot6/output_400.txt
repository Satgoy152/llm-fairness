Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  81   7  39   0  68   8  31  52
1  10  59  58   2  70  48  62  43  45
2  45  76  87  65  80  80  18  34  23
3  88  60  93  73  10  43  95  57  10
4  23  22  64  28  28  46  30  61  40
5  60  54  98  50  10  77  76  70  62
6  53   5  23  89  55  26  22  14  83
7  31   2  35  32  65   5  33  99  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for the items. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is a possible fair allocation, considering the valuations:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 6.
5. Agent 4 has a relatively high valuation for item 7.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 5.
7. Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 3.
8. Agent 7 has a high valuation for item 8.
9. We need to allocate one more item, let's choose item 0 for agent 3, as it also has a high valuation from them.

Here's the allocation based on these considerations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations while distributing all 9 items.
