Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  50  50  21  15  92  45  45  67
1  49  61  28  98  79  39  90  55  41
2  21  93  82   4  59  80  34  22   9
3  40  77  87  12  86  91  56  27  72
4  76  98  17  74  77  57   4  86  18
5  60  60  32  33  42   5  95  93  55
6  48  90  86  31  73  29   3  44  27
7  89  54  42  52  81  45  82  30  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, I will try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items and the others 1 item each.

Here's a reasonable allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 5 (value 92)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 98)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 93)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 (value 87)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 7 (value 86)
6. **Agent 5**: Item 6 (value 95)
7. **Agent 6**: Item 4 (value 73)
8. **Agent 7**: Items 0 and 8 (values 89 and 44)

This allocation ensures each agent gets an item with high personal value, and agent 7 receives two items to cover all 9 items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [0, 8]
}
```
