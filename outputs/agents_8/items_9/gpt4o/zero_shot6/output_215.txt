Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  48  36  58  62   7  74  52  82
1  55   7  68  47  44  93  90  31  69
2  78  66  97  86  69  28  12  92  54
3  98  18  14  94  61  71  99   2   5
4  59  78  49  91  40  53  65  32  50
5  76  23  64   3  43   2  77  47  97
6  72  53  51  94  56   2  51  97  46
7  48  95  66  65  76  40  48  70  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can consider a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the highest values for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 98 by agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 95 by agent 7.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 97 by agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 94 by agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 76 by agent 7.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 93 by agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 99 by agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 97 by agent 6.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 97 by agent 5.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: No items allocated
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Items 0, 3, 6 (3 items total)
- Agent 4: No items allocated
- Agent 5: Item 8
- Agent 6: Item 7
- Agent 7: Items 1, 4 (2 items total)

Now, we format this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3, 6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocations are made to maximize the agentsâ€™ values for the items they receive.
