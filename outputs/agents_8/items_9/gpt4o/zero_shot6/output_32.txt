Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  17  92  74  28  86  50   6  49
1  92  57  82  25  26  25  79  93  36
2  45  19  27  73  12   1  42  21  88
3  19  33  22   3   5  69  48  90  22
4  69  57  38  61  14  35  21  15  63
5  33  55   4  15  45  31  79   4  83
6  50  11  98  37  87  19  22  85   6
7  47  98   8  11  80  81  98  54   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Since there are 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive two items, and the others will receive one item each. We'll attempt to maximize the total value for each agent based on their valuations.

1. Agent 7 values item 1 highly (98), so we can allocate item 1 to Agent 7.
2. Agent 6 values item 2 highly (98), so we can allocate item 2 to Agent 6.
3. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (66), so we can allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 1 values item 7 highly (93), so we can allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
5. Agent 2 values item 8 highly (88), so we can allocate item 8 to Agent 2.
6. Agent 3 values item 5 highly (69), so we can allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
7. Agent 4 values item 3 highly (61), so we can allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
8. Agent 5 values item 6 highly (79), so we can allocate item 6 to Agent 5.
9. We'll allocate the remaining item, item 4, to Agent 4, as it has a relatively higher value for them compared to other agents.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [1]
}
```
