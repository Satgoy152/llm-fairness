Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6   4   1  32  55  93   7  43  11
1  37  67  89  68  82  34  28  52  83
2  98   1  23  78  69  91  55   2  47
3  35  25  84  65  57  96  58  32  90
4   3  70  59  95  50  25  42  54  62
5  43  55  74  91  17  57  96   1  80
6  63  45  65  69  89   0  77  11  72
7  40  47   9  31  32  39  28  42  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and exactly 9 items are allocated in total, we need to consider the preferences of each agent as indicated by their valuations. A common approach is to implement a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how it can be done:

1. For each item, find the agent who has the highest valuation for that item.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure each agent receives at most one item initially, then redistribute if necessary to ensure fairness and that exactly 9 items are allocated.

Following this approach, here is the allocation:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2 (valuation of 98).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 4 (valuation of 70).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 1 (valuation of 89).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 4 (valuation of 95).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 6 (valuation of 89).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 3 (valuation of 96).
7. Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 5 (valuation of 96).
8. Item 7 is valued highest by Agent 0 (valuation of 43).
9. Item 8 is valued highest by Agent 3 (valuation of 90).

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives a fair allocation, considering any redistribution that might be needed. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 8],
    "4": [1, 3],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [4],
    "7": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents while considering their highest valuations for a fair allocation.
