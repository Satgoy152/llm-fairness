Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  85  25   3  77  52  78  97   6
1   3  85  72  15  73  10  46   9  72
2  79  94  33  39  80  18  21  12  91
3  42   8   1  43  37  34  19  68  25
4  18  94  38  48  23  62  52  29  46
5  29  93  77  21   4  73  94  14  19
6  64  52  60  83   8  22  92  52  49
7  23  25  24  73  25  67  31   9   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and the allocations are balanced based on the valuations. Given that there are 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will end up with 2 items. We will try to distribute the items in such a way that the total valuation for each agent is reasonably balanced.

One possible method is to assign each agent an item with the highest valuation for them and adjust as necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item:
   - Agent 0: Item 7 (Value 97)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (Value 85)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (Value 94) - already taken by Agent 1, next highest is Item 8 (Value 91)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 (Value 43)
   - Agent 4: Item 1 (Value 94) - already taken, next highest is Item 5 (Value 62)
   - Agent 5: Item 6 (Value 94)
   - Agent 6: Item 3 (Value 83) - already taken, next highest is Item 6 (Value 92) - already taken, next is Item 0 (Value 64)
   - Agent 7: Item 5 (Value 67) - already taken, next highest is Item 3 (Value 73) - already taken, next is Item 2 (Value 24)

2. Allocate the remaining items to balance agent allocations:
   - Item 0, 2, and 4 are unallocated. Assign item 0 to agent 6 (who has only one item), item 2 to agent 7 (who also has only one item), and item 4 to agent 0 (who also has only one item).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, with one agent receiving two items.
