Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89   5  25  97  99  22  46  36  28
1   5  31  47  95  55  40  20  13   3
2  75   8   5  29  11  47  95  65  84
3  52  59  64  68   4  81  58  61  40
4   4  68  55  72  44  36  78  50  73
5  13  95  49  47  41  62  45  43  67
6   0  51  13  42  51  50   8   7  98
7  36  85  33  32  63  12  71  80  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the 8 agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, we can consider the agents' valuations for the items. A possible strategy is to allocate items based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and exactly nine items are allocated in total.

Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 4 (value 99) to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2 (value 47) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 6 (value 95) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 5 (value 81) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 1 (value 68) to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 5**: Allocate item 3 (value 47) to Agent 5.
7. **Agent 6**: Allocate item 8 (value 98) to Agent 6.
8. **Agent 7**: Allocate items 0 (value 36) and 7 (value 80) to Agent 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation takes into account each agent's highest-value item while ensuring all items are allocated.
