Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  82  66  30  73  25  27  83  38
1  68  79  56  12  10  59  24  36  89
2  91  26   9  88  45  72  66  50  68
3  28  93   7  84  49  14  67  82   6
4  34  54  37  91  38  81  92   1  88
5  49  11  36  46  94  44  56  14  63
6  36  16  10  38  83  26  55  52   2
7  43  97  91  24  68  89  14  11  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent obtains from their assigned items while ensuring each agent gets a number of items. Given there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each. Hereâ€™s one way to do the allocation:

1. Evaluate each agent's highest valuation for an item.
2. Assign items based on the highest valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Below is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 7 (value 83)
- Agent 1: Item 8 (value 89)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (value 91)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (value 93)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (value 92)
- Agent 5: Item 4 (value 94)
- Agent 6: Item 3 (value 38)
- Agent 7: Item 2 (value 91)

Since agent 7 has the highest valuation left for an unallocated item (item 5 with value 89), assign item 5 to agent 7.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [2, 5]
}
```
