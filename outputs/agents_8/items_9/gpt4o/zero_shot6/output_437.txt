Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26   8  24  36  10  27  41  31  86
1  31  44  88  10  14  70  15  67  19
2  28  67  13  44  96  97  18  56  30
3  65  97  49  88  52   5  36   2  10
4   9  51  74  73  98  74  36  44  12
5  62  83  13  32   9  86  29  42  55
6  63  31  72   9  84  65  26  70  57
7  51  67  90  74   4  19  10  14  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. This problem can be approached using different strategies, such as maximizing the minimum value an agent receives or maximizing the total valuations. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that attempts to balance the satisfaction across all agents by considering their highest-valued items.

Here's a possible fair allocation of the items:

- Agent 0: Items [8] (valued at 86)
- Agent 1: Items [2] (valued at 88)
- Agent 2: Items [5] (valued at 97)
- Agent 3: Items [1] (valued at 97)
- Agent 4: Items [4] (valued at 98)
- Agent 5: Items [0] (valued at 62)
- Agent 6: Items [6] (valued at 26)
- Agent 7: Items [3, 7] (valued at 74 and 14, respectively)

This allocation respects each agent's highest valuation for the items they receive, while also ensuring that all items are distributed fairly across the agents.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [3, 7]
}
```
