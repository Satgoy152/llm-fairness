Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  35  86  46  73  37  98  75  20
1  40  75  95  57  24  46  49  90  58
2  52  46  30  75  99  25  25  19  83
3  34  78  12  15  58  20  94  68  26
4  49   0  70  28  35  28  38  54  33
5  41  36  21   6  94  39   6  47  19
6  95   8  43  21  27  91  67  57  96
7  55  23  69  15  67  48  77  77  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents, we need to consider the preferences of each agent for the items, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. A simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 6 (95).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (78).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (95).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (75).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (99).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 6 (91).
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (98).
8. **Item 7**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (90).
9. **Item 8**: Highest valuation is by Agent 6 (96).

Let's summarize the allocations based on these preferences:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Items 2, 7
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: No items
- Agent 5: No items
- Agent 6: Items 0, 5, 8
- Agent 7: No items

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 5, 8],
    "7": []
}
```
