Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  69  80  41  44  52  74  81  66
1  74  12  78  94  12  19  94  79  27
2  63  55  39  87  97   5  67  52  32
3  56  35  97  15  50  88  52  17  37
4  15  63  37  16  53   6  46   5  28
5  44  73  41   2  22   2  14  15  43
6  53  63   9  99  97  74  81  87  42
7  45  57   1   9  59   6  86  75  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the rest receive 1 item each.

Here's a potential approach to allocate the items fairly:

1. Each agent should receive at least one item with the highest valuation for that agent.
2. The remaining items are then allocated to the agent who values them the most.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (81).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (94).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (97).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (97).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most (63).
- Agent 5 values item 1 the most (73), but it's already taken, so we allocate item 8 (43).
- Agent 6 values item 3 the most (99), but it's already taken, so we allocate item 6 (81).
- Agent 7 values item 6 the most (86), but it's already taken, so we allocate item 0 (45).

Now, all agents have one item each, except for Agent 5 who needs an extra item. The remaining unallocated item is item 5. We assign it to Agent 5 as they have the next highest valuation for it.

Now, the final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [8, 5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and one agent receives two items, with a total of 9 items allocated.
