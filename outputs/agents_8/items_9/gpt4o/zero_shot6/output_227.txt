Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  53  87  51  18  30  71  57  69
1  61  13  86  72  35  18  73  63  94
2  45  72  31  89  43  99  58  53  80
3  11  42  38  27  51  77   9  72   2
4  67  23  77  37  64  81  52  67  72
5  61   6  52  89  83  74   3  64  32
6  36  27  96  38  74   6  79  56  12
7  50  17  12  14   5  28  96  66  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to 8 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value an agent might receive from each item.
2. Distribute the items by trying to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, while ensuring every agent gets a fair chance at high-value items.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (Value: 87)
- Agent 1: Item 8 (Value: 94)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (Value: 99)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (Value: 72)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (Value: 64)
- Agent 5: Item 3 (Value: 89)
- Agent 6: Item 6 (Value: 79)
- Agent 7: Item 0 (Value: 50)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [0]
}
```
