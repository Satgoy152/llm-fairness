Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  74  74  56  78  90  84  45  20
1  84   8  18  26  45  74  63  77  88
2  70   4  55   7  45  78  95  47  64
3  71   0  62  45  89  29  85  67  43
4   0  81  90  89  84  71   0  40  17
5  23  68  43  48  67  18  16  30  44
6  14  47  52  88  12  49  71  41  20
7  90   6   9  82  16  73  55  95  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each.

One approach to achieve this is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, and then adjust to ensure everyone receives an item. Here is a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most at 90.
2. Agent 1 values item 8 the most at 88.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the most at 95.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the most at 89.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most at 90.
6. Agent 5 values item 1 the most at 68.
7. Agent 6 values item 3 the most at 88.
8. Agent 7 values item 7 the most at 95.

Since agent 4 has a second-highest value for item 4 (84) and agent 3 values item 4 (89) the most, we can adjust the allocation to allow agent 4 to receive item 0, which agent 7 values the most at 90, but agent 7 can receive item 7 (95).

Here is the final allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 8.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.
- Agent 4 gets items 2 and 0.
- Agent 5 gets item 1.
- Agent 6 gets item 3.
- Agent 7 gets item 7.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 0],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [3],
    "7": [7]
}
```
