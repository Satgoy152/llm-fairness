Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  55  89  13  36  25  39  40  51
1  45   4  42  24  76  16  77  98  16
2  81  32  15  56  95  61  12  36  12
3  42  46  27  58  64  62   5  31  83
4  11  67  99  99  45  69  51  10  63
5  94  75   8  64   2   2  99  59  47
6  63  77  94  51  12  86  91  98   8
7   1  27  94   2  86  14  36   2  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that balances fairness and the preferences of the agents. One approach is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and then to distribute any remaining items based on the highest valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Allocation:** Assign each agent one item for which they have the highest valuation. This ensures that every agent gets at least one item they value highly.
2. **Remaining Items:** Distribute any remaining items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring no agent has more than one more item than any other agent.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuation is for item 2 (89).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 7 (98).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 4 (95).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuation is for item 8 (83).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuation is for item 2 (99), but already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 3 (99).
6. **Agent 5:** Highest valuation is for item 0 (94).
7. **Agent 6:** Highest valuation is for item 7 (98), but already taken by Agent 1. Next highest is item 6 (91).
8. **Agent 7:** Highest valuation is for item 4 (86), but already taken by Agent 2. Next highest is item 2 (94), but already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 8 (60), but already taken by Agent 3. Next highest is item 1 (27).

After this initial allocation, the items taken are: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8. The only item remaining is item 5.

Now, assign the remaining item 5 to the agent with the next highest valuation for that item:

- Agent 0: 25
- Agent 1: 16
- Agent 2: 61
- Agent 3: 62
- Agent 4: 69
- Agent 5: 2
- Agent 6: 86
- Agent 7: 14

**Agent 6** has the highest valuation for item 5 (86). Since Agent 6 already has one item, this allocation is balanced.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [6, 5],
    "7": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share, with Agent 6 receiving one additional item due to the highest valuation and available item.
