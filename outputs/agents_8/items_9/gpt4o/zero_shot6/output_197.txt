Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  54  98  21  10  10  58  86  85
1  17  62  40  37  69  81  26  90  22
2  38  26  34  93  17  11  35  29   9
3  75   7  97  50  27   1  87  73  13
4  44  78  57  88  64  94  88  75   5
5  25  72  21  26  68  36  55  20  60
6   7  19  93  41  81  60  30  26  61
7  26  25  79  89  70  85  42  51   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, and each other agent will receive 1 item.

Initially, we can assign each agent one item based on their highest valuation, and then adjust to accommodate the extra item:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 2 (98).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 7 (90).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 3 (93).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 2 (97), but it's taken, so next highest is item 6 (87).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 5 (94).
6. **Agent 5**: Highest value is for item 4 (68).
7. **Agent 6**: Highest value is for item 2 (93), but it's taken, so next highest is item 4 (81).
8. **Agent 7**: Highest value is for item 3 (89), but it's taken, so next highest is item 5 (85), but it's taken, so next highest is item 4 (70), which is also taken, so allocate item 7 (51).

Now, we have assigned 8 items, and we need to allocate one more item to one of the agents. Let's analyze the remaining valuations to decide:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 7 (86), but it's taken, so allocate item 8 (85).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest is item 5 (81), but it's taken.

Considering the assignments and remaining options, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations.
