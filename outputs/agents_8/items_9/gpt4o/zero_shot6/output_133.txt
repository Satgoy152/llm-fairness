Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  74   1  12  89  18  93  16  21
1  21  68  96  70  90   9  90  53  75
2  64  81  18  83  31  72  52  35  28
3  36  89  59  50  28  18  61  59  31
4  85  21  38  56  27  68  43  60  13
5  25  98  81  38  93  97  34  35   3
6  12  47  31  99  41  19   0  79  63
7  89   9   7  30  73  74  76   9  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we must ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. We will aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives items they value highly, while also ensuring a fair distribution.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 receives item 6, which they value highly (93).
2. Agent 1 receives items 2 and 4, which they value highly (96 and 90).
3. Agent 2 receives item 3, which they value highly (83).
4. Agent 3 receives item 1, which they value highly (89).
5. Agent 4 receives item 0, which they value highly (85).
6. Agent 5 receives items 5 and 7, which they value highly (97 and 35).
7. Agent 6 receives item 8, which they value highly (63).
8. Agent 7 receives no items.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 7],
    "6": [8],
    "7": []
}
```
