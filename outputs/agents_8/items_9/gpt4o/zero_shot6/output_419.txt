Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  26  60  41  78  28  49  70  53
1  97  64  19  82   3  61  47  83  55
2  31  99  56  17  93  75  72   1  69
3  25  57  63  81  34  40  99   3  44
4  35   1  35  96  78  28  78  56  74
5  42  26  78  68  10  81  96  69  31
6  77  31  56  22   4  43  14  74  50
7  92  41   6  16  65   7  16  15   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while distributing the items fairly.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
2. If any items remain unallocated, distribute them to agents with fewer items or to those who can gain the most value.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 1 (97)
- Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 2 (99)
- Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 0 (60)
- Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 4 (96)
- Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 2 (93)
- Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 5 (81)
- Item 6: Highest value is by Agent 3 (99)
- Item 7: Highest value is by Agent 1 (83)
- Item 8: Highest value is by Agent 0 (53)

Based on the above analysis, here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [],
    "7": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all items are distributed among the agents.
