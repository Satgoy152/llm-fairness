Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  62  60  30  55  39  19  26  48
1  70  53  72  92  18  96  65  25   3
2  81  31  58   1  51  93  10  36  65
3  21   0  81  93  27   8  26  12  23
4  80  85  40   8  42  79  14  35  92
5  22  49  46  64  73   2  34  70  28
6  51  51  20  97  27  11  80  34  96
7  54   8  48  16  43  40   2  91  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can aim to distribute items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Assign items with the highest individual valuations to agents that value them the most.**

2. **Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, but considering there are more agents than items, at least one agent will not receive any items.**

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 8 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 6 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 7 values item 7 the most.

Let's ensure that each item is only assigned to one agent and no agent is assigned more than one item:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [7]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets one item except agent 7 who does not receive any item, ensuring a fair distribution given the constraints.
