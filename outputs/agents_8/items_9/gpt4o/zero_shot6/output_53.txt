Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  82  40  73  26  21  84  27  94
1  84  29  11  71  22  94  57  89  55
2  58  85  67  51  44  43  78   0  10
3  80  52  27  45  61  55  82  21  41
4  62   8  42  94  99  30  70  30  12
5  42  21  37  42  87  24  31  61  85
6  70  30  60  17  82  70  87   9  78
7  31  12  84  13  72  73  84  97  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent. Here's how the allocations can be done based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 84 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 85 by Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 84 by Agent 7.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 94 by Agent 4.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 99 by Agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 94 by Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 87 by Agent 6.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 97 by Agent 7.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 94 by Agent 0.

Now, let's check if any agent gets more than one item, which could lead to adjustments:
- Agent 1 has items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 has item 1.
- Agent 4 has items 3 and 4.
- Agent 6 has item 6.
- Agent 7 has items 2 and 7.
- Agent 0 has item 8.
- Agent 3 and 5 have no items.

To ensure fairness, we can adjust the allocation so that no agent receives more than one item (as much as possible) while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 8
2. **Agent 1**: Item 0
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1
4. **Agent 3**: Item 5
5. **Agent 4**: Item 3
6. **Agent 5**: Item 4
7. **Agent 6**: Item 6
8. **Agent 7**: Items 2 and 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and shares the items across all agents as fairly as possible based on their preferences.

Here's the final JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [2, 7]
}
```

This setup ensures that all 9 items are allocated and each agent is involved in the allocation process.
