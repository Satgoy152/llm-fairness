Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  69   2  32   8  72  34  24  91
1  67  29  54  58  81  50  52  24  77
2  21  29   4  81  24  27  38  38  17
3  27  32  57  97  92  55  87  96  31
4  37  78  64  55  62  72  79   6  63
5  15  27  14   6  81  44  53  94  62
6  35  24  62   4  75  27   8  55  49
7  56  29  33  14  62  40  47  75  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation is balanced. Given that there are 8 agents and 9 items, we can allocate one item to each agent and then allocate the remaining item to one of the agents. Below is a possible allocation of items:

1. Assign one item to each agent in a way that maximizes their value for the item.
2. Give the remaining item to the agent who values it the most among those who have received only one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 8 (value 91, highest value from agent 0).
- Agent 1 receives item 4 (value 81, highest value from agent 1).
- Agent 2 receives item 3 (value 81, highest value from agent 2).
- Agent 3 receives item 7 (value 96, highest value from agent 3).
- Agent 4 receives item 1 (value 78, highest value from agent 4).
- Agent 5 receives item 5 (value 44, highest value from agent 5, after item 4 which is taken by Agent 1).
- Agent 6 receives item 2 (value 62, highest value from agent 6).
- Agent 7 receives item 6 (value 47, highest value from agent 7).

Now, we have allocated 8 items. The remaining item is item 0, with the highest unallocated value of 67 from agents 0 and 1. Since agent 0 received a higher-valued item (8 with value 91), we will give this item to agent 1 to balance the allocation.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, with one agent possibly receiving two, and all items are fairly distributed based on the values provided.
