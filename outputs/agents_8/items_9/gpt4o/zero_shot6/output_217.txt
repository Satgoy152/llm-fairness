Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  38  57  28   9  62  84  81  14
1  35   3  31  54  40  74  89   3  68
2  51  32  29  30   1  40  66  59  21
3  57  45  91  71  88  50   6  57  92
4  77  51  32  73   3  69  68  45   5
5   1  79  38   4  90  13  26  56  22
6  86  55  54  24  49   3  46   3   9
7  51  58  28   6  19  39   0  21   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method where each agent gets at least one item, ensuring a fair distribution. This involves assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, while avoiding conflicts by ensuring each item is only assigned once.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest value item for each agent that hasn't already been allocated.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Following this strategy, here is a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0: gets item 6 (highest value for agent 0 and not allocated)
- Agent 1: gets item 5 (highest value for agent 1 and not allocated)
- Agent 2: gets item 0 (highest value for agent 2 and not allocated)
- Agent 3: gets item 8 (highest value for agent 3 and not allocated)
- Agent 4: gets item 3 (highest value for agent 4 and not allocated)
- Agent 5: gets item 4 (highest value for agent 5 and not allocated)
- Agent 6: gets item 1 (highest value for agent 6 and not allocated)
- Agent 7: gets item 2 (highest value for agent 7 and not allocated)
- Agent 1 (again): gets item 7 (next highest value for agent 1 and not allocated)

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3],
    "5": [4],
    "6": [1],
    "7": [2]
}
```
