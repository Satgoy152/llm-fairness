Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  44  65  94   5  85  64  99  22
1  65  63  49  42  72   5  12  49  15
2   4  38  40   3  50  55  50   3  67
3  57  50  88  32  36  19  60  61   8
4  35   4  67  78   0  76  90  22  48
5  31  70  93  63  73   7  63  45  45
6  77  20   5  41  28   8  10  66  26
7  85  45  17  53  98  66  14  24  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. Given the complexity of finding an absolutely fair allocation, we can approximate by ensuring that each agent receives some items, and the total value is somewhat balanced among them. Here's an allocation based on the values provided:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 3, and 7.
2. Agent 1 has a relatively high value for item 4.
3. Agent 2 has a high value for item 8.
4. Agent 3 has a high value for item 2.
5. Agent 4 could take item 6.
6. Agent 5 has a high value for item 1.
7. Agent 6 could take item 5.
8. Agent 7 has a high value for item 4, but since it is already taken, we allocate item 3.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [3]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and there are 9 items in total allocated.
