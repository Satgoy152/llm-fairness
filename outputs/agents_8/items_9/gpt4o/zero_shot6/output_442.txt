Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  15   4  59  32  89  66  95  81
1  70  37  34  81  37  96  36  31  98
2  12  59  64  56  69   5  17  88  74
3  48  98  69  45  33  73  91  22  22
4  67  44  50  61  95  28  49   4  57
5  14  40  32  54  66   3  21  57  50
6  98  23  67  92  37  44  80  69  38
7  53  76  55  18  97  79  11  30   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value assigned to the agents. One common method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. 

First, let's determine which agent values each item the most:

- **Item 0**: Agent 6 with a value of 98
- **Item 1**: Agent 3 with a value of 98
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 with a value of 64
- **Item 3**: Agent 6 with a value of 92
- **Item 4**: Agent 7 with a value of 97
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 with a value of 96
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 with a value of 91
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 with a value of 95
- **Item 8**: Agent 1 with a value of 98

Now, let's allocate the items according to these preferences:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Items 5, 8
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Items 1, 6
- Agent 4: 
- Agent 5: 
- Agent 6: Items 0, 3
- Agent 7: Item 4

This allocation ensures each item goes to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [],
    "5": [],
    "6": [0, 3],
    "7": [4]
}
```
