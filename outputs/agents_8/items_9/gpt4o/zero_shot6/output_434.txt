Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  50  17  40  37  61  68  63  85
1  62  38  15  22  64  76  71  16  95
2  13  98  35  22  84  82  45  62  20
3  37  62  26  37  79  99  76  40  14
4  94  81  35  39  11  54  85  18   2
5  16  83   0  41  22  45   7  80  95
6  75  72  74  48  89  31  11   1  69
7  97  60  49  96   5  79  59  58  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent receives at least one item, while maximizing the total valuation for the selected items. Since there are 8 agents and 9 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's consider the highest valuation each agent has for any item and assign that item to them. If an item is already taken, we assign the next highest valued item available.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Find the highest valued item for each agent.
2. Assign the item if it's available; if not, move to the next highest valued item for the agent.
3. Ensure all items are allocated.

Following this process:

- Agent 0: Highest value for item 8 (85).
- Agent 1: Highest value for item 8, but it's taken, so take item 5 (76).
- Agent 2: Highest value for item 1 (98).
- Agent 3: Highest value for item 5, but it's taken, so take item 3 (37).
- Agent 4: Highest value for item 0 (94).
- Agent 5: Highest value for item 8, but taken, item 7 (80).
- Agent 6: Highest value for item 4 (89).
- Agent 7: Highest value for item 0, but taken, item 3, but taken, item 1, but taken, item 5, but taken, item 7, but taken, item 6 (59).

After these allocations, item 2 is unallocated. We assign it to Agent 7, who has a second-highest value on an unallocated item.

The final allocation is:
```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [7],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [2, 6]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 9.
