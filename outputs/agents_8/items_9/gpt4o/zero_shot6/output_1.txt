Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  25  73  39   9   0  84  84  88
1   0  81  57  97  51  81  36  36  90
2  47  34  37  46  22  29  31   5  15
3  26  68  69  41  28  88  59  54   9
4  74   7  65  56  63  30  57  79  70
5  45  62  61  61  31  64  69  75  94
6  88  74  79  75  80  98  58  71   6
7  85  79  76  42  87  47  21  68  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, given there are 9 items and 8 agents. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Begin by calculating the highest value each agent has for any item.
2. Attempt to allocate each agent their highest-valued item, ensuring each item is allocated only once.
3. If conflicts arise (multiple agents desire the same item), allocate based on maximizing overall value and ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
4. Assign any remaining unallocated items to agents based on their next highest valuations.

Here is a potential allocation based on the given strategy:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (value 95)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (value 97)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (value 37)
- Agent 3: Item 5 (value 88)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (value 79)
- Agent 5: Item 8 (value 94)
- Agent 6: Item 4 (value 80)
- Agent 7: Item 1 (value 79)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total value based on the given valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [8],
    "6": [4],
    "7": [1]
}
```
