Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  65  18  89  74  14  98  54  84
1  38  68   9  25  20  48  47  26  48
2  92   4  33  39  41  17  53  53  33
3   9  33  64  49  95  15  25  74  88
4  82  85  35  29   6  21  97  70  15
5  71  12  97  24   4  17  57  73  67
6  70  95  52  28   5  81  19  30  58
7  93  68  91  85  84  15  71  82  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and that all items are distributed.

Considering the valuations provided, let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items that Agent 0 values highly.
   - Item 6 (value 98)
   - Item 3 (value 89)

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize items that Agent 1 values highly.
   - Item 1 (value 68)

3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items that Agent 2 values highly.
   - Item 0 (value 92)

4. **Agent 3**: Prioritize items that Agent 3 values highly.
   - Item 4 (value 95)

5. **Agent 4**: Prioritize items that Agent 4 values highly.
   - Item 7 (value 70)

6. **Agent 5**: Prioritize items that Agent 5 values highly.
   - Item 2 (value 97)

7. **Agent 6**: Prioritize items that Agent 6 values highly.
   - Item 5 (value 81)

8. **Agent 7**: Prioritize items that Agent 7 values highly.
   - Item 8 (value 58)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [5],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation is designed to maximize the value for each agent based on the provided valuations.
