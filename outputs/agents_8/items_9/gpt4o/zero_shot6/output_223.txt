Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  43  27  21  57  98  49  28  53
1  83  39  17  93  49   0  94  90  70
2  53  31  11  47  80  41  11  16  45
3  20   8  83  79  63   8  67  56  58
4  29  36  46  44  24  57  57  28  82
5  89  81  47  20  86  75  96  64  16
6  46  39  31  74  72  48  16  79  88
7  28  95  14  69  83  41  84  43  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. We will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. 

Given there are 8 agents and 9 items, and considering each agent can get at least one item, we can allocate the items as follows:

1. Calculate the maximum value each agent assigns to any item to see which items are most valued by which agent.
2. Assign items to agents based on these valuations, ensuring that no item is left unallocated and that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is one possible fair allocation of the items to the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [0],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [1]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 5, which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 6, which are among the higher valued items for them.
- Agent 2 receives item 4, their highest valued item.
- Agent 3 receives item 2, which has a high valuation for them.
- Agent 4 receives item 8, which is a highly valued item for them.
- Agent 5 receives item 0, one of their highly valued items.
- Agent 6 receives item 7, a high value item for them.
- Agent 7 receives item 1, which is their highest valued item.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated fairly based on the agents' valuations.
