Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15   7  72  94  22  55  55  80  43
1  53  29  14  95  48  50  60  97  11
2  23  73   6  32  48   8   0  39  22
3  83  64  62  68  89  68  70  43  83
4  46  43  23  19  82  78  55   9  68
5  45  74  39  39  34  92  23  82  74
6  11  64  88  42  22  41  98  75  60
7  21  50  76  50  53  80  56  65  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider maximizing the valuations as much as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will receive 2 items.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (value 94)
- Agent 1: Item 7 (value 97)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (value 73)
- Agent 3: Item 4 and Item 8 (values 89, 83)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (value 78)
- Agent 5: Item 6 (value 23)
- Agent 6: Item 2 (value 88)
- Agent 7: Item 0 (value 21)

This allocation tries to distribute the items based on high individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [2],
    "7": [0]
}
```
