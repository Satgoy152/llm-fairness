Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  57  69  41   9  14  66  23   0
1  17  89  94  60  82  70  59   3  51
2  55  43  27  59  25  71  71  61   5
3  92  56  65  55  83   7  64  23   1
4  60  54  81  27  55  13  64   2  65
5   8  88  18   7  99  62  22  82  83
6  80  66  89  91  94  79  76  85  82
7  61  27  42  18  81  52  44  68   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach to ensure each agent gets at least one item and the allocations are as fair as possible based on their valuations. We'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction (sum of values) while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuations to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (95).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (94).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (71).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 (55).
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 4 (55).
6. Agent 5 has the highest valuation for item 1 (88).
7. Agent 6 has the highest valuation for item 6 (76).
8. Agent 7 has the highest valuation for item 7 (68).

Item 8 is left, and we can allocate it to the agent with the next highest valuation who hasn't received many items. Agent 6 has a relatively high valuation for item 8 (82) and can receive this item to balance the allocation.

Based on this analysis, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [6, 8],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.
