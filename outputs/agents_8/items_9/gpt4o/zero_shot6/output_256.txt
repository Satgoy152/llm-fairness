Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  62   6  10  99   5  46  69   9
1   7  48  38  29  32  86  25  81  78
2  43  67  88  40  37  45  43  39  30
3  76  70  52  44  14  94  36  61  84
4  42  77   6  91  95  96  66  31  94
5  45  46  98  69  82  48  71  51  65
6   5  50  23  47  26  63  14  70   2
7  56   2  71   3  93  38   8  40   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the total value of items as evenly as possible among the agents. We can achieve this by considering each agent's valuation of the items and trying to maximize the total satisfaction or value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Values for items: [52, 62, 6, 10, 99, 5, 46, 69, 9]
   - Assign items with the highest values: [4, 7]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values for items: [7, 48, 38, 29, 32, 86, 25, 81, 78]
   - Assign items with the highest values: [5, 8]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values for items: [43, 67, 88, 40, 37, 45, 43, 39, 30]
   - Assign item with the highest value: [2]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values for items: [76, 70, 52, 44, 14, 94, 36, 61, 84]
   - Assign item with the highest value: [5] (already taken, choose next best)
   - Assign items: [0]

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Values for items: [42, 77, 6, 91, 95, 96, 66, 31, 94]
   - Assign items with the highest values: [3, 6]

6. **Agent 5:**
   - Values for items: [45, 46, 98, 69, 82, 48, 71, 51, 65]
   - Assign item with the highest value: [2] (already taken, choose next best)
   - Assign items: [1]

7. **Agent 6:**
   - Values for items: [5, 50, 23, 47, 26, 63, 14, 70, 2]
   - Assign item with the highest value: [7] (already taken, choose next best)
   - Assign items: [3] (already taken, choose next best)
   - Assign items: []

8. **Agent 7:**
   - Values for items: [56, 2, 71, 3, 93, 38, 8, 40, 6]
   - Assign item with the highest value: [4] (already taken, choose next best)
   - Assign items: []

After attempting to allocate the highest possible values, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 6],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [],
    "7": []
}
```

Note: This allocation assumes that item 5 was initially assigned but later adjusted due to overlaps, and all items are allocated fairly by value preferences. Adjustments were made to ensure 9 unique items were allocated in total.
