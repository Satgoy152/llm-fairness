Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  46  93  17  59  90  70  74  39
1   1   7  33  88  58  85  85  23  52
2  49  79  91  15  33  21  18  95  80
3  72  70  98  87  13  61  93   1  33
4  19  60  33  58  87  81   0  60  82
5  55  78  12  47  41  20  69  74  25
6  59  10  33  20  40  31  75  72  99
7  66  44   4  96  99  94  26  41  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can consider a method like maximizing the total value each agent receives or ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Since there are 9 items and 8 agents, at least one agent will receive two items. Let's attempt a balanced approach by considering the value each agent assigns to the items and trying to distribute the items to maximize fairness.

Hereâ€™s a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest but since item 2 is already allocated, the next highest is item 0.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 6 values item 8 the highest.
- Agent 7 values item 4 and item 3 the highest but since item 4 is already allocated, the next highest is item 3.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [1],
    "6": [8],
    "7": [5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and no item is left unallocated. Agent 7 receives two items, which balances the allocation since it is a higher preference for agent 7.
