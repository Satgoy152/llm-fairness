Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28   6  56  78  62  63   9  75  81
1  96  90  65  39  15  36  24  69  49
2  69  72  23  70  96  26  71  72  73
3  10  33  22  94  52  73  22  83  45
4  99  37  62  71  87   6  57  64  37
5  51  78  24  64  58  74  24  53  93
6  57  81  20  29  96  10  97  86  47
7  62  41   0  97  22  50  71  15  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. One common fair allocation method is to allocate each agent the item where they have the highest valuation, ensuring each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Examine each item's valuations across all agents and allocate the item to the agent who has the highest valuation for that item.

Following this method:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is 99 by agent 4.
- Item 1: Highest valuation is 90 by agent 1.
- Item 2: Highest valuation is 65 by agent 1.
- Item 3: Highest valuation is 97 by agent 7.
- Item 4: Highest valuation is 96 by agent 2 (tie with agent 6, but agent 2 has fewer items).
- Item 5: Highest valuation is 74 by agent 5.
- Item 6: Highest valuation is 97 by agent 6.
- Item 7: Highest valuation is 86 by agent 6.
- Item 8: Highest valuation is 93 by agent 5.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: No items.
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: No items.
- Agent 4: [0]
- Agent 5: [5, 8]
- Agent 6: [6, 7]
- Agent 7: [3]

This allocation method ensures that every item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and each agent gets at least one item if they have a high enough valuation.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0],
    "5": [5, 8],
    "6": [6, 7],
    "7": [3]
}
```
