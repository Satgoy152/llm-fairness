Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  37  22  59  62   1   9  19  32
1  99  36  90  79   7  41   3   7  61
2  27  72  41  30  64  50  31  65  64
3  47  17  58  57  92  73  77   4  47
4  12  18  99  85   0  33  22  31  75
5  28  97  36  86  12  55  79  18  87
6  84  15  69  90  14  45   4  24  55
7  53  68  55  54  70  12  34  99  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item if possible. Given the constraints, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent to identify which items are most valuable to them.
2. Allocate items to the agents based on their preferences while ensuring that the total number of allocated items is 9.

Hereâ€™s the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most, but since it's already allocated, we choose the next preference, item 6.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 5 values item 1 the most, but since it's already allocated, we choose the next preference, item 3.
- Agent 6 values item 3 the most, but since it's already allocated, we choose the next preference, item 0.
- Agent 7 values item 7 the most.

Given these preferences and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [],
    "7": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item they value highly, and all 9 items are distributed. In cases where conflicts arise (multiple agents wanting the same item), we allocate based on the highest value and ensure that another item is allocated to the other agent.
