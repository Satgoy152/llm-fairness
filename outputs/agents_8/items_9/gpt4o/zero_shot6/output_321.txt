Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42   9  12  11  11  44  15   8   9
1  82  63  20  85  84  60  82  38  35
2  99  10  96  35  36   1  67  55  91
3   7  89  27  14  13  42  17  61  44
4  88  27  44  99  94  90   1  63  58
5  88   1  16  22  93  55   4  93  11
6   6   7  72   1  72  93  65   7  43
7  90  48  46  30   3  75  66  72  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, while also making sure that all items are allocated. Since there are 8 agents and 9 items, at least one agent will receive more than one item.

Here is a possible allocation strategy considering the valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly with a valuation of 42.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 highly with a valuation of 85.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly with a valuation of 96.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 highly with a valuation of 89.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 highly with a valuation of 94.
6. Agent 5 values item 5 highly with a valuation of 55.
7. Agent 6 values item 6 highly with a valuation of 65.
8. Agent 7 values item 7 highly with a valuation of 72.

Now, we have allocated 8 items among the 8 agents, and we have one item remaining (item 8). We should allocate this item to the agent who has the next highest value for any remaining item. In this case, Agent 2 values item 8 highly with a valuation of 91.

Therefore, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the valuations provided.
