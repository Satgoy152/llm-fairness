Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  32  98  51  56  51  94  95  45
1  80  85  79  46   9  83  15  84  45
2  19  44  77   4  89  81  77  58  44
3  54  66  44  20  58  38  81  70  31
4   0  51  10  85  45  12   6  92  99
5  85   0  71  64  82  33  81   1  12
6  44  41  32  97  91  99  11  81  79
7  17  66  68  74  10  29  65  81  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations for each item. A common approach is to assign items in a way that maximizes the total value across all agents, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Given that there are 9 items and 8 agents, one agent will get 2 items, and the others will get 1 item each.

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Determine Top Valuations:** Identify the highest valuation for each item and the corresponding agent.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. If an agent ends up with more than one item, adjust the allocation to ensure fairness.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If any agent has no items after the initial allocation, reallocate some items to ensure each agent gets at least one.

Following this process, here's a possible fair allocation:

- Assign items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring no agent is left without an item.
- Reallocate items if necessary to balance the number of items per agent.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [5, 7],
    "7": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, with one agent receiving two items to account for the total of 9 items.
