Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  45  26  75  66  65  20  66  31
1  70  18  21  60  94  52  75  10  57
2  18  87  40  60   2  78  45  86  56
3  12   4   1  12  36  24  57  99  65
4  50  90  98  73  31  31  91  46   1
5   8  11  31  95  65  46  11  51  56
6  94  76  23  62  29  61  50  96  33
7  67  82  23  77  57  90  22  40  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 8 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, while keeping in mind the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items as fairly as possible based on these valuations.

One way to approach this problem is to use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent given their preferences. However, given that we have more agents than items, some agents will inevitably receive no items.

Here's one possible allocation based on maximizing valuations:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 3 and 0, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 7, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 5 has a high valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 5.
7. Agent 6 has a high valuation for item 6, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 6.
8. Agent 7 has a high valuation for item 8, so we allocate item 8 to Agent 7.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at most one item, which is a reasonable distribution given the constraint of 9 items for 8 agents. Each agent receives the item they value most highly among the remaining items.
