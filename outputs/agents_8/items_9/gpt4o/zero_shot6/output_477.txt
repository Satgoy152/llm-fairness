Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  10  60   5  32  79  95  58   4
1  10  93  45  62  86  23  25  81  67
2  20  93  13  49  42  48  17   4  47
3  28  49  67  56  19  96  11  52  80
4  24  51  17  56  70  66  90  70  50
5  46  64  91  43  80  69  15  21  15
6  93   5  53  34  65  58  80  10  29
7  86  10   3  95  66  17  72  23  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the assignments reflect some balance in the value distribution. Since there are 8 agents and 9 items, one of the agents will receive two items. Let's make sure to assign items in a way that tries to balance the total value among agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 5, which they value the most.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, which they value the most.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives item 6.
- Agent 5 receives item 2.
- Agent 6 receives item 0.
- Agent 7 receives item 7 and item 8, as they have relatively lower values and need another item to balance value distribution.

Here's how the allocation can be represented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6],
    "5": [2],
    "6": [0],
    "7": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item, with agent 7 receiving two items to balance the distribution of values.
