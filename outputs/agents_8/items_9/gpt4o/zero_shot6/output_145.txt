Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  79  59  80  83   6  27  72  27
1  18  15  84  31  27  78  61  20  42
2  28  67  17  48  18  87  20  51  75
3  97  65  95  15  41  43  47  72  67
4   6  27  66  76  49  50  51  19   8
5  54   1  15  70  41  35  63  40   6
6  89  17  37  71  42  50  50   8  20
7  85  82  84  69   1  53  50  16  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them such that each agent receives items that maximize their valuation. Additionally, since there are 9 items and 8 agents, at least one agent will receive more than one item.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate each agent's highest-valued item.
2. Assign the highest-valued item to each agent if it has not been assigned to another agent already.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure that all items are distributed.

After considering the valuations, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (value of 80).
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 (value of 84).
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (value of 87).
- Agent 3 highly values item 0 (value of 97).
- Agent 4 highly values item 3, but it's already taken by Agent 0, so assign their second choice which is item 4 (value of 49).
- Agent 5 highly values item 6 (value of 63).
- Agent 6 highly values item 0, but it's already taken by Agent 3, so assign their second choice which is item 3, but it's already taken by Agent 0, so assign their third choice which is item 4, but it's already taken by Agent 4, so assign item 7 (value of 8).
- Agent 7 highly values item 1 (value of 82).

Adjust the allocation such that all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [4]
- Agent 5: [6]
- Agent 6: [7]
- Agent 7: [1, 8] (Agent 7 gets item 8 as an additional allocation due to the constraint of 9 items with 8 agents)

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4],
    "5": [6],
    "6": [7],
    "7": [1, 8]
}
```
This ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.
