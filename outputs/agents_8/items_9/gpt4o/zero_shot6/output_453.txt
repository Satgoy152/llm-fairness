Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  21  24  41   0  21  23  43  57
1  54  60  23  33  69  15  44  64  91
2  50  43  36  99  69  55  37  80  59
3  30  78  62  14  51  76  57  88  89
4  45  58  95   8  32  48  94  51  98
5  17  67  63  21  42  70  22  94   0
6  30  62  37  28  36  80  13  82  40
7  95  82  14  34  43  97  89  83  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. We need to allocate all 9 items, and each agent may get zero or more items.

One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items, ensuring each item is allocated only once, and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with allocating the items:

1. Item 8 has a high valuation from agent 1 (91).
2. Item 3 has a high valuation from agent 2 (99).
3. Item 7 has a high valuation from agent 3 (88).
4. Item 5 has a high valuation from agent 7 (97).
5. Item 6 has a high valuation from agent 4 (94).
6. Item 1 has a high valuation from agent 3 (78).
7. Item 4 has a high valuation from agent 1 (69).
8. Item 0 has a high valuation from agent 7 (95).
9. Item 2 has a high valuation from agent 4 (95).

Now, let's write the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [8, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7, 1],
    "4": [6, 2],
    "5": [],
    "6": [],
    "7": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent their highest valued items where possible while ensuring all items are allocated.
