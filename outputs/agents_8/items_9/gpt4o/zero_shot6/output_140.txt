Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 8 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  83  27  62  57  84  84   8  46
1  12  95  85  96  68  77  97  30  28
2  42  14   3  79  70  18  75  28  69
3  47  44   4  14  58  59  18  87  69
4  92  52  27  75  29  95  78  35   9
5   7  40  44  90   9  49  48  80   3
6  99  31  83  92  99  22  88  23  45
7   4  60  23  30  10  57   8  50   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...],
        "5": [11,12,...],
        "6": [13,14,...],
        "7": [15,16,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.

    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among 8 agents, we can attempt to ensure that no agent is significantly worse off than others in terms of the total value of items they receive. One simple approach is to assign items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring each agent gets at least one item until all items are allocated. 

Let's evaluate the allocations:

1. Assign items based on the highest value for each item across all agents.
2. If an agent already has an item, consider the next highest value and so on.
3. Continue this until all items are allocated.

Following these steps, the allocations can be determined as follows:

- Item 0: Highest value is 99 by agent 6.
- Item 1: Highest value is 95 by agent 1.
- Item 2: Highest value is 85 by agent 1, but agent 1 already has item 1, so next highest is 83 by agent 0.
- Item 3: Highest value is 96 by agent 1, but agent 1 already has item 1, so next is 92 by agent 6, but agent 6 has item 0, so next is 90 by agent 5.
- Item 4: Highest value is 99 by agent 6, but agent 6 has item 0, so next is 70 by agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest value is 95 by agent 4.
- Item 6: Highest value is 97 by agent 1, but agent 1 has item 1, so next is 88 by agent 6, but agent 6 has item 0, so next is 84 by agent 0.
- Item 7: Highest value is 87 by agent 3.
- Item 8: Highest value is 69 by agent 2, but agent 2 has item 4, so next is 69 by agent 3.

Now, here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [5],
    "5": [3],
    "6": [0],
    "7": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item where possible, and all 9 items are allocated.
