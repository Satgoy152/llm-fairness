Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  25  56  13  41  55  54
1  87  66  65  49  98  55  31
2  55  15  54  33  20  38  70
3   8  37  29  43  14  37  59
4  56  29   5  46  46  39  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. This method ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who has the highest valuation for that item. Here's how the allocation would look:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 87.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 66.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 56.
4. Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most at 46.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 55.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 70.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all 7 items are allocated.
