Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  47  99  43  91  81  17
1  15  52  75  92  21  49  56
2  48  80   1  32  33  70  71
3   5  75  49   6  57  58  78
4  29  51  87   3  62  21  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 2 (99), then 4 (91).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 3 (92).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 1 (80), then 6 (71).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 6 (78).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 2 (87).

After considering the above options, we need to ensure each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [3]
- Agent 2: Items [1]
- Agent 3: Items [5]
- Agent 4: Items [0, 6]

Now we check if all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item:

- Total items allocated: 7 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

Here's the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```
