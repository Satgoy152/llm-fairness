Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  60  97  23  19  24  21
1  88  44  86  66  28  12  99
2  31  16  95  47  93  56  62
3  11  18  72  77  93   4  27
4  44  79  36  16  68  18  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual preferences for the items. Here’s one way to approach this:

1. **Identify High Value Preferences:** Look for the highest value that each agent has for any item and attempt to allocate that item to them, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

2. **Allocation Strategy:** Since there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Aim to balance the allocations while maximizing agent satisfaction.

3. **Iterate and Adjust:** As the items are allocated based on maximum satisfaction, adjust so that each agent gets at least one item if possible, while adhering to the total number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (value 97).
- Agent 1 highly values item 6 (value 99).
- Agent 2 highly values item 2, but since it’s already taken, we look at other options: item 4 (value 93).
- Agent 3 highly values item 4, but it’s already taken, so we consider item 3 (value 77).
- Agent 4 highly values item 1 (value 79).

Now, some items are still available, and some agents may have lower total values. We can adjust by assigning the remaining items to balance out the allocations:

- Remaining items: 0, 5.
- Agent 0 receives item 0 (since item 2 is already allocated to them) and item 5 to ensure fairness and maximize their value.
- Agent 3 receives item 3, ensuring they have at least one item.
- Agent 2 is left with item 6.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with a focus on maximizing the value they receive based on their preferences.
