Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  41  40  32  73  45  27
1  53   7  85  64   9  80  27
2  16  39  36  47  68  16  76
3  36  29  87  89  18  80  32
4  26  92  25  47   4  58  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation received by each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. We can use a greedy approach to achieve this by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, one at a time, until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 with 64
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 4 with 92
   - Allocate to Agent 4

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 with 87
   - Allocate to Agent 3

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 with 89
   - Allocate to Agent 3

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 with 73
   - Allocate to Agent 0

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 1 with 80
   - Allocate to Agent 1

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 2 with 76
   - Allocate to Agent 2

Let's finalize the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most while ensuring all items are distributed and respecting the condition of the integer allocations.
