Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  20  57  77  73  77  68
1  89  66  72   5  38  34  90
2  13  54  53  39  13  52  72
3  31  68  39  43  18  28   4
4  13  41  75  68  15  53  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 0 (89). We allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest (77). We allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

3. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest (68). We allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

4. **Agent 4** values item 2 the highest (75). We allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

5. **Agent 1** also values item 6 the highest after item 0 (90). We allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

6. **Agent 0** values item 5 the highest after item 3 (77). We allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

7. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (13). We allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

Now, all items have been allocated. Here's the allocation presented in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
