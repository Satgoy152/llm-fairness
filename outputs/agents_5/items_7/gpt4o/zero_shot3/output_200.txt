Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  95  68  24  66  46  94
1  76  71  71  88  15  83  52
2  56  82  66  10  98  62  76
3  86   6  27  58  38  58  99
4  60  24  45  77  36  57  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while ensuring all items are allocated. We will use a greedy approach, attempting to assign each item to the agent who values it most, while also balancing the total number of items each agent receives.

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is for agent 1 (value 76).
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is for agent 0 (value 95).
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is for both agent 1 and agent 2 (value 71), but since agent 1 has already received an item, assign to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is for agent 1 (value 88), but since agent 1 already has an item, assign to agent 4 with second-highest value (77).
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is for agent 2 (value 98).
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is for agent 1 (value 83), but since agent 1 already has an item, assign to agent 0 with second-highest value (46).
7. **Item 6**: The highest value is for agent 3 (value 99).

Allocating with these considerations, the distribution of items is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 3: Item [6]
- Agent 4: Item [3]

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
