Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  79  58  17  93  46  44
1  64  93  96  98   1  10  21
2  95  47  57  43   7  19  75
3  48  68  13  54  55  60  65
4  57  59  84  27  83  48  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [95 47 57 43  7 19 75]
 [48 68 13 54 55 60 65]
 [57 59 84 27 83 48 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a heuristic approach that considers maximizing the total valuation for each agent. We'll try to assign items to agents such that each agent's total valuation is maximized, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations for items 4 (93) and 0 (87).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations for items 3 (98) and 2 (96).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations for items 0 (95) and 6 (75).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations for items 5 (60) and 6 (65).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations for items 2 (84) and 4 (83).

Considering the constraints and aiming for a fair distribution, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 4.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 6.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 5.
- **Agent 4**: Assign items 0 and 2.
- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [0, 2]

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, with a focus on maximizing each agent's valuation for their allocated items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
