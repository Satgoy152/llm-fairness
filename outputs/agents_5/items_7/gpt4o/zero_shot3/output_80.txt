Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  47  24   2   6  86  24
1  37  60  72  45  68  53  32
2  25  42   8  24  79  73  55
3  83  59  58  57  32  47   8
4  74  50   4  35  38  74  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. We'll ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Allocate the item**: Assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Since there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents might receive more than one item, but every item must be allocated.

Let's allocate:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 83.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 47.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 72.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 45.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 79.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
- **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most at 82.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are fairly and optimally distributed among the agents.
