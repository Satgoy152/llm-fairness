Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  45  11  46  76  31  33
1  12  24  34  45  14  83   7
2  54  84  30  55  15  83  23
3  39  45  95  99  76  85  89
4  53  68  58  71  40  11  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can utilize a method that seeks to maximize the total values assigned to each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's how the allocation can be done based on the given valuations:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Distribute any remaining items to agents who haven't reached their fair share.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value is 54 (Agent 2)
- Item 1: Highest value is 84 (Agent 2)
- Item 2: Highest value is 95 (Agent 3)
- Item 3: Highest value is 99 (Agent 3)
- Item 4: Highest value is 76 (Agent 0)
- Item 5: Highest value is 85 (Agent 3)
- Item 6: Highest value is 89 (Agent 3)

Now, let's distribute the items fairly:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1
- Agent 3: Items 2, 3, 5, 6
- Agent 4: No items

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Now, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2, 3, 5, 6],
    "4": []
}
```
