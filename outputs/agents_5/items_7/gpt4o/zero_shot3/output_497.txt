Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  20   7  27  73  40  14
1  83  13  25  82  58  17  15
2  45  61  75  56  23  93  47
3  13  29  47  83  54  98  22
4  83  47  74  55  48  29   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring all items are distributed. One way to handle this is to use a greedy algorithm, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given there are more items than agents, this should be feasible.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from agent 1 with 83. Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from agent 2 with 61. Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from agent 2 with 75. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from agent 3 with 83. Allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from agent 0 with 73. Allocate item 4 to agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is from agent 3 with 98. Allocate item 5 to agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is from agent 2 with 47. Allocate item 6 to agent 2.

Now let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0 is allocated item [4].
- Agent 1 is allocated item [0].
- Agent 2 is allocated items [1, 2, 6].
- Agent 3 is allocated items [3, 5].
- Agent 4 is not allocated any items.

The total allocations sum up to 7 items, and each item has been assigned to one agent. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2, 6],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": []
}
```
