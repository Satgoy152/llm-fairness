Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  10  93  86  26   3  48
1  73  54  84  81  26  22  77
2   4  55  64  65  80  27   9
3  32  61  78  98  10  50  29
4  87  59  27  17  57   1   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations for the items. A possible approach is to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Highest values are for items 2, 3, and 0. Assign item 2 (value 93).
- Agent 1: Highest values are for items 2, 0, and 3. Assign item 3 (value 81).
- Agent 2: Highest values are for items 4, 3, and 2. Assign item 4 (value 80).
- Agent 3: Highest values are for items 3, 2, and 1. But item 3 is already taken, so assign item 1 (value 61).
- Agent 4: Highest values are for items 0, 1, and 4. Assign item 0 (value 87).

Now some items are still unallocated. Items 5 and 6 remain:

- Agent 0: Assign item 6 (value 48), as it is the next highest value for this agent.
- Agent 1: Assign item 5 (value 22), as it is the next highest value for this agent.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all 7 items are allocated.
