Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  31   8  92  36  12  47
1  10  99   1  47  22  33  84
2  73  61  45  67  65  32  19
3  41  60  58  34  21   0  44
4   4  64  55  84  16  63   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[72 31  8 92 36 12 47]
 [10 99  1 47 22 33 84]
 [73 61 45 67 65 32 19]
 [41 60 58 34 21  0 44]
 [ 4 64 55 84 16 63  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total value perceived by each agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items for Agent 0 are 3 (92) and 0 (72).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item for Agent 1 is 1 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items for Agent 2 are 0 (73) and 3 (67).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value items for Agent 3 are 1 (60) and 2 (58).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value items for Agent 4 are 3 (84) and 1 (64).

Now, let's allocate the items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 3 (92).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (99).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (73) and item 4 (65).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 2 (58).
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 5 (63) and item 6 (6).

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and most agents get items they value highly. Let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```
