Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  52  16   5   8  58   6
1  51  54   6  39  50  19  10
2  39  33  72  62  49  63  11
3  72  55   4  10   2  11  57
4  32  58  50  66  98  27  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives at least one item, and the total value received by each agent is somewhat balanced. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**:
    - Highest valuations: Item 0 (85), Item 5 (58)
    - Allocate Item 0 and Item 5 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Highest valuations: Item 1 (54), Item 4 (50)
    - Allocate Item 1 and Item 4 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Highest valuations: Item 2 (72)
    - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
    - Highest valuations: Item 6 (57)
    - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
    - Highest valuations: Item 3 (66)
    - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 4

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated: Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are allocated.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
