Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  97  58  31  55  77  16
1  85  96  38  32  99  26  46
2  66   3  20  99  45  31  54
3  19   4  10  20  86  61  60
4  83  53  51   4  36   5   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to allocate items in such a way that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Start by considering the highest valuations for each item across all agents. This will help in allocating the item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Allocate Items**: Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. This doesn't guarantee fairness in terms of total value received by each agent, but it ensures that each item is allocated to an agent who values it highly.

3. **Review and Adjust**: After initial allocation, check if any agents have not received any items or if the distribution is not balanced in terms of item count. Adjust the allocation to ensure all agents have been considered and items are fairly distributed.

Now, let's apply this approach to the given table of valuations:

- Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value = 85)
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value = 97)
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value = 58)
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value = 99)
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value = 99)
- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value = 77)
- Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value = 60)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents based on their valuations, and every item is allocated to an agent who values it highly.
