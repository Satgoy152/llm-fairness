Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  97  64  19  78  24  79
1  93  27  13  84  87  81  55
2  52  78  66  86  89  70  98
3  91  13  78  78  28  32  82
4  34   2  35  39  98  95  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives a fair distribution of items. This often involves trying to assign each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring each agent ends up with a relatively balanced number of items.

Let's evaluate the best allocation based on the given table:

1. Item 0:
   - Best value is for Agent 0 with 96.
   
2. Item 1:
   - Best value is for Agent 0 with 97.

3. Item 2:
   - Best value is for Agent 3 with 78.

4. Item 3:
   - Best value is for Agent 2 with 86.

5. Item 4:
   - Best value is for Agent 4 with 98.

6. Item 5:
   - Best value is for Agent 1 with 81.

7. Item 6:
   - Best value is for Agent 2 with 98.

Allocate items to agents:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 3: Item [2]
- Agent 4: Item [4]

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to the agent who values it the highest, while also distributing the items fairly across all agents.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
