Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  30  99  78  47  24  72
1  20  79  46  39  28  12  18
2  54  91  35  37  44  99  16
3  65  33  52  35   7  43   6
4  50  77  93  76   6  59  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items. A common approach is to assign items based on the maximum valuation each agent has for unassigned items. We'll aim to ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (value: 99), so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (value: 79), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 5 (value: 99), so assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 0 (value: 65), so assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 6 (value: 84), so assign item 6 to Agent 4.
6. With remaining items 3 and 4, we can look at remaining values:
   - Agent 0's highest remaining value is item 3 (value: 78).
   - Agent 4's highest remaining value is item 3 (value: 76), but has item 6 already.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 has the highest valuation for an unallocated item).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value: 7 for Agent 3, as Agent 3 has lower value for remaining item).

Thus, the allocations can be fairly distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, maximizing individual agent satisfaction based on their valuations.
