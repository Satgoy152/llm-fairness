Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  69  14   0  41  87  49
1  49  98   0  17  26  60  16
2   2  19  31  20  67  14  44
3   3  33  12  53   6  67  85
4   0  16  84  88  65  44  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (87), Item 1 (69)
   - Allocate: Items 5 and 1

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (98), Item 0 (49)
   - Since item 1 is already allocated, allocate: Item 0

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (67), Item 6 (44)
   - Allocate: Items 4 and 6

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 6 (85), Item 5 (67)
   - Since items 6 and 5 are already allocated, consider the next highest: Item 3 (53)
   - Allocate: Item 3

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (88), Item 2 (84)
   - Since item 3 is already allocated, allocate: Item 2

Let's verify all items are allocated:
- Items allocated to Agent 0: [5, 1]
- Items allocated to Agent 1: [0]
- Items allocated to Agent 2: [4, 6]
- Items allocated to Agent 3: [3]
- Items allocated to Agent 4: [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
