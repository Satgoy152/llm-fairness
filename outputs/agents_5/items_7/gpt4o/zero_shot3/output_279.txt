Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  86  80  65  48  70   8
1  23  21  71  93  26  72  77
2   3   7  37  46  38  96  81
3  41  31   3  17  21  78  37
4  31  53  77  95  30  16  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can start by considering each agent's highest-valued items. However, since there are 7 items and 5 agents, at least two agents will receive more than one item. We'll aim to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [4, 86, 80, 65, 48, 70, 8]
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (Value: 86)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [23, 21, 71, 93, 26, 72, 77]
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (Value: 93)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [3, 7, 37, 46, 38, 96, 81]
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (Value: 96)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [41, 31, 3, 17, 21, 78, 37]
   - Highest value item: Item 5, but already taken. Next highest: Item 0 (Value: 41)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Values: [31, 53, 77, 95, 30, 16, 66]
   - Highest value item: Item 3, but already taken. Next highest: Item 2 (Value: 77)

With these allocations, we still have Items 4 and 6 to allocate. We choose based on maximizing the remaining agents' values:

- **Agent 0:** Already has one item, next highest value remaining is Item 4 (Value: 48)
  
- **Agent 1:** Already has one item, next highest value remaining is Item 6 (Value: 77)

Now we have allocated all items, and each agent has received a fair share based on their highest valuations. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
