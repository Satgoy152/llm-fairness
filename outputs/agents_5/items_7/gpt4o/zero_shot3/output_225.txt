Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  99  67  83  99  32  35
1  57  81  83  51  27  42  19
2   1  36  98  63  30  70  97
3  78  87  40  42  20  56  10
4  87  61  40  29  96  20  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on each agent's highest value for an item that hasn't been allocated yet. This ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's analyze and allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 1 (value 99). Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 2 (value 83). Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 2 (value 98), but it's already taken, so we move to their next highest, item 6 (value 97). Allocate item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 1 (value 87), but it's already taken, so we move to their next highest, item 0 (value 78). Allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 4 (value 96). Allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate 2 more. We will distribute the remaining items (3 and 5) based on the remaining highest values:

6. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 3: The highest remaining value for item 3 is by agent 0 (value 83). Allocate item 3 to agent 0.
   - Item 5: The highest remaining value for item 5 is by agent 2 (value 70). Allocate item 5 to agent 2.

With these steps, all 7 items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
