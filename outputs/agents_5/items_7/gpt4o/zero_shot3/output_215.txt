Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  32  57  91  81  43  33
1   9  13   5  80  35  94  33
2  45  32  15  79  85  43  18
3  83  67  16   8  73  85  77
4  22   9  86  21   2  25  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Let's consider the sum of the valuations for each item across all agents and allocate items in such a way that tries to balance the maximum valuation each agent can receive.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation of 91 for item 3.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has the highest valuation of 94 for item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has the highest valuation of 85 for item 4.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has the highest valuation of 85 for item 5, but since item 5 is allocated, we choose item 6 for them due to high valuation.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent has the highest valuation of 86 for item 2.

Then, allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 0, where it has the highest valuation compared to others.
- Agent 1 can take item 1, where no other agent has a significantly higher valuation.

This distribution ensures that the highest possible valuations are achieved for each agent with the remaining items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
