Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  78   2  70  99  93  42
1  89  25  36  69  54  50  60
2  92  37  67  24  75  80  82
3  53   0  16  41  52  13  66
4  90  76  86  39   2  45  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27 78  2 70 99 93 42]
 [89 25 36 69 54 50 60]
 [92 37 67 24 75 80 82]

 [90 76 86 39  2 45 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 6.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 6.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 2 and 0.

Let's distribute the items accordingly:

- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value: 99).
- Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value: 92).
- Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value: 66).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value: 25).
- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value: 93).
- Assign item 2 to agent 4 (value: 86).
- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value: 69).

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations among agents, making sure each agent gets at least one item. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```
