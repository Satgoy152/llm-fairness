Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  30  66  54  59  37  71
1  56  91  50  85   1  37  90
2  11  18  17  90  70  16  40
3  96  77  40  85  56  47  49
4  84  54  59  22   4  60   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations for the items. We can use a simple heuristic approach for this allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.
2. If there are any conflicts (i.e., an item is desired by multiple agents), prioritize based on the highest valuation.

Let's start by checking each item's highest value and assign it to the respective agent:

- Item 0: Highest value is 96 (Agent 3)
- Item 1: Highest value is 91 (Agent 1)
- Item 2: Highest value is 66 (Agent 0)
- Item 3: Highest value is 90 (Agent 2)
- Item 4: Highest value is 70 (Agent 2)
- Item 5: Highest value is 60 (Agent 4)
- Item 6: Highest value is 90 (Agent 1)

Now, let's allocate each item to the corresponding agents:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 6
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 5

This allocation ensures that each agent is assigned at least one item while maximizing the valuation for each item. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```
