Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  61  54  75  39  52  80
1  39   3  93  26  36   4  27
2  21  39  31  28  36  55  41
3  50  72   5   4  77  90  15
4  76  72  37  45  96  74  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy approach to ensure that each agent gets the items they value the most, while also ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item that they value the most, ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent.
2. Allocate the remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. Each agent's highest valued item:
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (value 80)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (value 93)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (value 55)
   - Agent 3: Item 5 (value 90), but item 5 is already selected by Agent 2, so next highest value is Item 4 (value 77)
   - Agent 4: Item 4 (value 96), but item 4 is already selected by Agent 3, so next highest value is Item 0 (value 76)

2. Allocate remaining items by maximizing the remaining values:
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 3, 5
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (value 75)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (value 61)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (already assigned)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (already assigned)
   - Agent 4: Item 0 (already assigned)

By assigning the remaining items based on the highest available value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, we can achieve the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
