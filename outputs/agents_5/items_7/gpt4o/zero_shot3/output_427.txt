Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  66  44  40  18  58  89
1  27  19  15  72  35  76  77
2  89  51  94  12  19  49  24
3  12  39  49  11  97  57  18
4  75  21  63  29  20  47   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. A common method is to use a greedy approach where each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent has received to ensure fairness.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Find the highest valuation for each item and allocate it to the respective agent.**
2. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible. If not possible, balance the allocation to ensure fairness.**

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (89).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (66).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (94).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (72).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (97).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (76).
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (89).

Now, let's ensure fairness by adjusting if necessary:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 3: Item [4]
- Agent 4: No items

The allocation is already balanced with each agent receiving either one or two items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": []
}
```
