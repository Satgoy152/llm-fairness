Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55   4  38  79  88  58  24
1  92  52  50  45  61  57  33
2  61  35  80  76  11  93  78
3  45  31  94   8  66  52  11
4  87  93  20  30  96  52  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 5 agents and 7 items, each agent might not get an item, as all cannot be equally distributed. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 4 the most (88). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 the most (92). Assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 the most (93). Assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 the most (94). Assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 1 the most (93). Assign item 1 to agent 4.
6. Now, we have items 3 and 6 remaining.

Let's allocate the remaining items by looking at second preferences:

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0: 79
  - Agent 1: 45
  - Agent 2: 76
  - Agent 3: 8
  - Agent 4: 30

  Agent 0 values item 3 the most (79). Assign item 3 to agent 0.

- **Item 6**:
  - Agent 0: 24
  - Agent 1: 33
  - Agent 2: 78
  - Agent 3: 11
  - Agent 4: 23

  Agent 2 values item 6 the most (78). Assign item 6 to agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to an agent, and the distribution seeks to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.
