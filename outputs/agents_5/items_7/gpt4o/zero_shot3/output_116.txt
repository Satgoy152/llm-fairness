Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  25  73  28  86  43  53
1  31  17   4  91  84  85  11
2  12  79  68  67  25  98  49
3  24  70  44  81  68   2  51
4   0  65  61  18  24   4  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a straightforward approach by considering the agents' valuations for the items. We aim to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, where possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure that all agents have received at least one item, if feasible, and all items are allocated.

Here is one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (86).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (91).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (98).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (70).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most (89).
- Agent 0 can also take item 2 (73).
- Agent 3 can take item 0 (24).

This ensures all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [6]
}
```
