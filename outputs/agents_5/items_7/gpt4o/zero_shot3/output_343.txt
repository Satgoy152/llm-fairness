Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53   9  18  29  99  43  35
1  27  76  62  14  87   2  17
2  29  58  88  54  39  17  98
3  49  12  65  38  27  67  61
4  46  72   0  49  11  90  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53  9 18 29 99 43 35]
 [27 76 62 14 87  2 17]
 [29 58 88 54 39 17 98]
 [49 12 65 38 27 67 61]
 [46 72  0 49 11 90 32]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item: 4 (value 99)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item: 1 (value 76)
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued item: 6 (value 98)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued item: 5 (value 67)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valued item: 5 (value 90), but item 5 is already assigned.
   - Next highest valued item: 3 (value 49)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, we have items 0 and 2 unassigned:

6. Assign item 0:
   - Highest available valuation: Agent 0 (value 53)
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

7. Assign item 2:
   - Highest available valuation: Agent 2 (value 88)
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the highest possible total value based on their preferences, with all items allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
