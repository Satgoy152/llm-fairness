Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  30  70  85  51   1  88
1  31  55  89  50  89  53   9
2  53  49  83  21  50  57  86
3  38  18  43  77  43  44  74
4  75  16  77  25  33  82   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that every item is assigned to exactly one agent. This problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm or optimization techniques, but given the constraints and size, a simpler approach can be taken.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (88).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (89).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the second highest (83), but since it's already taken, item 6 is next (86).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (77).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest (82).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 3 (85), as agent 3 already has item 3.
- Agent 1 can take item 4 next (89), as it's the second highest value for agent 1.
- Agent 2 can take item 0 (53), since it has no conflict with higher values.

Now let's put this into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items that provide them with relatively high value, and all items from 0 to 6 are assigned.
