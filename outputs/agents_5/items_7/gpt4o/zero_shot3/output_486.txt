Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  23  46  48  57  29  38
1  89  97   7   9  78  53  85
2  38   0  80  61   3   7  95
3  51  44  55  47  75  28  54
4  81  87  56  15  99  59  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the five agents, we aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives from their allocated items. Given that there are 7 items and 5 agents, each agent should ideally have the opportunity to receive at least one item, with some agents potentially getting more than one. We will look for an allocation that attempts to balance the total value received by each agent.

Let's analyze the table to determine a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 4 and 3.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values are for items 1 and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values are for items 6 and 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest values are for items 4 and 2.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest values are for items 4 and 1.

Now, let's make the allocations by attempting to give each agent their highest-value items while ensuring each item is only allocated once.

**Allocations:**
- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 50)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (value 97)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (value 80)
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (value 54)
- **Agent 4**: Item 4 (value 99)

Now, we have two items left to allocate (3 and 5). Let's consider the next highest preferences for the agents and distribute these items:

- **Agent 3**: Item 3 (value 47)
- **Agent 4**: Item 5 (value 59)

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
