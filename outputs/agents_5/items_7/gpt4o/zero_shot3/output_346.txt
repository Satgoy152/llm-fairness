Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  12  35  66  59  66  23
1   2  61  24   7  81  10  84
2  26  37  47   5  77  12  23
3  80  71  78  76  24  84  86
4  45  18  19  86  43  78  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a simple approach to achieve this:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Adjust the allocations if necessary to ensure each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 80.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 61.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 78.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most at 86.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most at 84.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 86.

Initially, this allocation gives Agent 3 four items, Agent 1 two items, and Agent 4 one item. Agents 0 and 2 have no items. We need to ensure some balance:

- Reassign Item 0 to Agent 0, who values it at 7, to ensure they get at least one item.
- Reassign Item 5 to Agent 2, who values it at 12, to ensure they get at least one item.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.
