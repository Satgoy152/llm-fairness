Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  76  90  64  79  11  19
1  34  52  82  77  94  63  77
2  41  32  93  91  96  87  71
3  35  10  44  22  49  31  43
4  28  11  57  99  56  63  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy approach that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no agent receives more than two items.

Let's evaluate each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 41.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 76.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most at 93.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most at 99.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 87.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 77.

Now, we need to ensure that the distribution is fair, with each agent receiving at least one item and no agent receiving more than two items. Let's adjust the allocation to achieve this:

- For Agent 0, assign item 1.
- For Agent 1, assign item 6.
- For Agent 2, assign items 0, 2.
- For Agent 3, assign no items.
- For Agent 4, assign item 3.

After this allocation, we still have items 4 and 5 unallocated. Let's allocate them to agents with fewer items:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

Now, we have a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items, and all items are allocated.
