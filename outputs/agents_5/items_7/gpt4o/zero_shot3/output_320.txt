Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84   9  77  73  80  35  36
1  35  68  88  65  53  63  94
2  29  27  85  34  40  30  32
3  49  88  55  14  12  54  70
4  12  93  14  99  89  11  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent. Given the constraints, we are aiming for a balanced distribution where each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated equals 7.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest among their options.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the highest.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest.

Now, since we need to allocate all 7 items, we can adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed with consideration for the next highest values available:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

This way, each agent gets an item they value highly, and all items are distributed fairly.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```
