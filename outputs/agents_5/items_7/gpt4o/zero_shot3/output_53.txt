Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49   7  64  58  44   4  61
1  42  76  54  11  35  33  44
2  73  39  50  38  99  20  58
3  52  85  38  89   5  44  48
4   8  87  30  96  83  98  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A reasonable approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocation while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**: To maximize their total value, we should give them items they value highly. The highest values for Agent 0 are items 2 (64) and 6 (61).

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (76), followed by item 2 (54). Since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can give Agent 1 item 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 4 (99). They also value item 0 (73) highly.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (89).

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has high valuations for items 5 (98) and 3 (96). Since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 3, we can allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, let's check if every item is allocated, and adjust if needed:

- Items allocated so far: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
- All items are allocated.

Let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an item, and all items are assigned.
