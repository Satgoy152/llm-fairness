Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  35  82  24  88  92  79
1  43   9  25  93  49  47  77
2  62  27   3  90  76   8  63
3  47   0  17  20  76  25  97
4  19   7  73  10  38  42  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives at least one item. This is a classic problem of fair division, and while there is no single "correct" solution, one common approach is to maximize the total utility while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here is one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Assign items to agents in a way that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction (or total value).
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 1, 4, 5 (choose one of these)
- **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 3
- **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 0
- **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 6
- **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 2

I'll start by assigning the highest valued items uniquely to each agent in a way that tries to maximize satisfaction:

1. Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 92)
2. Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 93)
3. Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 62)
4. Agent 3 gets item 6 (value 97)
5. Agent 4 gets item 2 (value 73)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1 and 4) to agents:

- Item 1 can be allocated to Agent 0 (value 35)
- Item 4 can be allocated to Agent 3 (value 76)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to optimize the individual agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the 5 agents.
