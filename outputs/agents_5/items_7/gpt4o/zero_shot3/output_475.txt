Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  21  39  74  27  70  37
1  97  63  57  86  23  72  20
2  15  55  56  39  53  20  56
3  24  68  55  95  98   5   3
4   2  96  50  27  90   9  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 21 39 74 27 70 37]
 [97 63 57 86 23 72 20]
 [15 55 56 39 53 20 56]
 [24 68 55 95 98  5  3]
 [ 2 96 50 27 90  9 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one way to do it:

1. Agent 0 gets item 3 (valuation 74)
2. Agent 1 gets item 0 (valuation 97)
3. Agent 2 gets item 6 (valuation 56)
4. Agent 3 gets items 4 and 2 (valuations 98 and 55)
5. Agent 4 gets items 1 and 5 (valuations 96 and 9)

This allocation ensures that each item is given to an agent, and all items are distributed. Now, here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 2],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
