Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  57  91  50  72  75  61
1  45  59   5  39  62  29  23
2  58  44  68  57  55  98  99
3  32   9  82  91  22  98  99
4  57  17  36  42  67  56  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. A simple and effective method for this is the "greedy allocation," where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can implement this:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Find the agent with the highest valuation.
   - Agent 0: 46
   - Agent 1: 45
   - Agent 2: 58
   - Agent 3: 32
   - Agent 4: 57
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (value 58)

2. **Item 1**: Find the agent with the highest valuation.
   - Agent 0: 57
   - Agent 1: 59
   - Agent 2: 44
   - Agent 3: 9
   - Agent 4: 17
   - **Allocate to Agent 1** (value 59)

3. **Item 2**: Find the agent with the highest valuation.
   - Agent 0: 91
   - Agent 1: 5
   - Agent 2: 68
   - Agent 3: 82
   - Agent 4: 36
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (value 91)

4. **Item 3**: Find the agent with the highest valuation.
   - Agent 0: 50
   - Agent 1: 39
   - Agent 2: 57
   - Agent 3: 91
   - Agent 4: 42
   - **Allocate to Agent 3** (value 91)

5. **Item 4**: Find the agent with the highest valuation.
   - Agent 0: 72
   - Agent 1: 62
   - Agent 2: 55
   - Agent 3: 22
   - Agent 4: 67
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (value 72)

6. **Item 5**: Find the agent with the highest valuation.
   - Agent 0: 75
   - Agent 1: 29
   - Agent 2: 98
   - Agent 3: 98
   - Agent 4: 56
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (value 98)

7. **Item 6**: Find the agent with the highest valuation.
   - Agent 0: 61
   - Agent 1: 23
   - Agent 2: 99
   - Agent 3: 99
   - Agent 4: 47
   - **Allocate to Agent 2** (value 99)

### Final Allocations:

Now, let's present the allocations as specified:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
