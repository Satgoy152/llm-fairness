Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  32  51  84  49  64  46
1  79  89  35  43  75   2  62
2  67  76  82  12  72   3  76
3  88  63  40  74  90  21  78
4  92  47  86  11  47   1  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 5 (64) and item 0 (22). Total valuation = 86.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (89) and item 4 (75). Total valuation = 164.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 (76). Total valuation = 76.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 (74). Total valuation = 74.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 2 (86). Total valuation = 86.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents. Now, let's provide the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
