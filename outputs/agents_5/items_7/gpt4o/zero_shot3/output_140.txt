Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  69  80  19  65  78  49
1  50  74  61  49  67  87  61
2  42  58  30   1  38  64   1
3  96  43  15  52  29  41  40
4  63  85  50  86  14   6  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated, we can use a strategy that considers the highest valuations each agent has for the items.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items are 2 (80) and 5 (78).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item is 5 (87).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item is 5 (64), but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest value item is 1 (58). 
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value item is 0 (96).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value item is 6 (98).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.

- Re-evaluate remaining items (3 and 4) across agents considering what hasn't been allocated:

6. **Agent 4**: 
   - Second highest available is item 3 (86).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

7. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest remaining is item 4 (67).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has received an item.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6, 3]
}
```
