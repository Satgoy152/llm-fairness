Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  63  94  18  26  31  90
1   5  91  61  44  48  22  41
2  38  54  13  32  36  60  81
3  67  10  58  97  39  34  59
4  52  38  15  89  11  41  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: 31, 63, 94, 18, 26, 31, 90
- Agent 1: 5, 91, 61, 44, 48, 22, 41
- Agent 2: 38, 54, 13, 32, 36, 60, 81
- Agent 3: 67, 10, 58, 97, 39, 34, 59
- Agent 4: 52, 38, 15, 89, 11, 41, 30

We need to allocate 7 items to these 5 agents. We'll aim to give each agent the item they value most highly, subject to availability, to ensure a fair distribution.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign each agent their highest valued item that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Ensure all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 2 (value 94)
- **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 1 (value 91)
- **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 6 (value 81)
- **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 3 (value 97)
- **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 3 (value 89) but item 3 is already taken, so we move to the next highest, item 0 (value 52)

At this point, items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 have been allocated. We need to allocate items 4 and 5.

- **Remaining items**: 4, 5
- **Remaining agents needing items**: All agents have at least one item, but we need to distribute the remaining items.

Distribute remaining items to agents who value them next highest or have the least total value thus far:
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it next highest (39) after their already assigned item, but they already have a high total. Agent 1 values it (48) higher than others without having a second item yet.
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it (60) higher than others without having a second item yet.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed fairly based on their valuations.
