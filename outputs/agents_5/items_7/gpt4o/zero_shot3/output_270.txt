Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  78  64  61  34   8  14
1   2  26  47  55  47  46  69
2  55  64   8  55  11  74  54
3  89  84   0  15  93   7  39
4  57  66  65  65  29  48  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This is a variation of the "Maximum Nash Welfare" approach or "Envy-Free" allocation where we try to maximize the product of utilities each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step allocation for the items to the agents based on their valuations:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for any item, which is item 4 with a value of 93. Assign item 4 to agent 3.
2. **Agent 0** has the next highest unique valuation, which is item 1 with a value of 78. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5, which is 74. Assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** also highly values item 0 with 89, but given item 4 was already allocated to them, we avoid giving them another unless necessary. Instead, Agent 2 values item 0 at 55, which is fair. Assign item 0 to agent 2.
5. **Agent 1** highly values item 6 with 69. Assign item 6 to agent 1.
6. **Agent 4** values item 2 at 65 and item 3 at 65. Assign item 3 to agent 4.
7. Finally, item 2 is left. Agent 4 values it at 65 as well. Assign item 2 to agent 4.

Now let's organize the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 2]
}
```

Each agent has received an integer number of items, and all 7 items have been allocated.
