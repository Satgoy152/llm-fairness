Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14   3  61  15  59  23  25
1   9  14  31  30  56  90  45
2  11   1   3  80  89  28  76
3  34  36   3   3  80  98  89
4  76  96  97  33  27  81  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while considering their valuations. We'll try to maximize the overall satisfaction by allocating items to the agents who value them the most, balancing the distribution.

Let's consider a simple approach:

1. Each agent should ideally receive one item.
2. Identify the highest valued item for each agent and allocate it to them.
3. If there are leftover items, allocate them to the agents who value them the most among the unallocated items.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 61, highest for agent 0).
- Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 90, highest for agent 1).
- Agent 2 gets item 4 (value 89, highest for agent 2).
- Agent 3 gets item 6 (value 89, highest for agent 3).
- Agent 4 gets item 1 (value 96, highest for agent 4).

Now, items 0 and 3 remain unallocated. We will allocate them as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 4 has the second-highest value (76), so allocate item 0 to agent 4.
- Item 3: Agent 2 has the second-highest value (80), so allocate item 3 to agent 2.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
