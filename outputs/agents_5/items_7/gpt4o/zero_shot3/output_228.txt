Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  64  13   8  80  26  41
1  79   4  20  49  46  84  37
2  28  70  60  92  77  53  48
3  76  34  48  27  27  66  68
4  67  70  45  52  28  39   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we can use a greedy algorithm to ensure that each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most. We'll proceed by considering each item and assigning it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item. After allocation, we'll check to ensure that every agent gets at least one item or none if that's inevitable. This way, we ensure that all items are distributed while aiming for a fair allocation based on preferences.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is 79 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is 70, shared by Agent 2 and Agent 4. We can assign it to Agent 2 as they have fewer high-valued options.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 60 by Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 92 by Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 80 by Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is 84 by Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is 68 by Agent 3.

Based on these allocations, we will now ensure that each agent is assigned at least one item if possible, and all items are distributed.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives Item 4.
- Agent 1 receives Items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives Items 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 3 receives Item 6.
- Agent 4 receives no items, as their valuations did not top any category, and there are no items left to reallocate without decreasing the total valuation.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, while adhering to a fair distribution based on the highest valuations per item.
