Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  66  41  76   8  83  62
1  70  36  39  37  38  30  56
2  45  15  97  97  38  26  26
3  67  89  63  35  92  89  19
4   9  96  36  27  87  34   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the distribution is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

Here's a potential fair allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations for items are [3, 66, 41, 76, 8, 83, 62]. The highest valuations are for items 5 (83) and 3 (76).
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations for items are [70, 36, 39, 37, 38, 30, 56]. The highest valuation is for item 0 (70).
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations for items are [45, 15, 97, 97, 38, 26, 26]. The highest valuations are for items 2 (97) and 3 (97). Since item 3 is already taken, assign item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations for items are [67, 89, 63, 35, 92, 89, 19]. The highest valuation is for item 4 (92).
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations for items are [9, 96, 36, 27, 87, 34, 0]. The highest valuation is for item 1 (96).

Based on this, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 1

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to ensure all 7 items are allocated. Two items, 3 and 6, remain unallocated. We can distribute them as follows while maintaining fairness:

- Agent 0 can also take item 6, as it has a decent valuation (62).
- Agent 2 can take item 3, as it has the highest valuation for it (97).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are fairly distributed among the 5 agents based on their valuations.
