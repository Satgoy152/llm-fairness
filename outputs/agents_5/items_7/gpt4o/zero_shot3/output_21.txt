Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  93  18  32   3  87  87
1  43  22  29  76  68  35  90
2  38  37  24  58  22  73   6
3  84  22  12  19  63  16  48
4  25   0  93  10  90  62  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and a total of exactly 7 items are allocated. We should aim for a distribution where each agent gets items they value the most, ensuring the distribution is as fair as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 and item 5 the highest (93 and 87, respectively).
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest (90).
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the highest (73) but Agent 0 values it higher so we can look at item 3 which is the next highest for Agent 2 (58).
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest (84).
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 the highest (93).

Now, let's allocate the items based on these preferences:

- Assign item 1 and item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

We have now allocated 6 items. We need to allocate one more item:

- The unallocated items are 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 4 since it's their second highest value.

Now, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are distributed.
