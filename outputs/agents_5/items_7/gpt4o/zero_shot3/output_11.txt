Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82   5   7  84   0  91  73
1  83  31  29  61  24  39  64
2  32   5  10  31  84   9  28
3  45  13  73  91  82  16  23
4  97  55  31  91  95  52  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82  5  7 84  0 91 73]
 [83 31 29 61 24 39 64]
 [32  5 10 31 84  9 28]
 [45 13 73 91 82 16 23]
 [97 55 31 91 95 52 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations provided, a simple approach is to assign items based on the highest value for each item across all agents:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 with a value of 97.
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 with a value of 55.
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 with a value of 73.
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 84.
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 with a value of 95.
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 91.
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 with a value of 99.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items. In this case, it seems that Agent 4 is taking a large portion of the items. 

To balance the allocation:
- Agent 4 can be given items 0, 1, 4, and 6.
- Agent 0 can be given items 3 and 5.
- Agent 3 can be given item 2.

Let's check this allocation:
- Agent 0: [3, 5]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [0, 1, 4, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 1, 4, 6]
}
```
