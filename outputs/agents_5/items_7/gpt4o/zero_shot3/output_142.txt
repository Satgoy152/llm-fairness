Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  65  75  69  74  93  48
1  51  93  73  21  23  88  33
2  37  39  64  76  48  49  82
3  17  31  70  83  21  36  12
4  58  48   0  99  56   1  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total satisfaction or value gained by each agent. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (99), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (93), so assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the most (82), so assign item 6 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the most (83), so assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the most (99), but since it's already assigned, item 6 is their next highest value. However, item 6 is also assigned, so we go with item 4 as their next highest available (56).
6. Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2 and 5).

To fairly allocate the remaining items:
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 0 after their first pick, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 0 after their first pick, so assign item 5 to agent 0.

Now, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item if possible.
