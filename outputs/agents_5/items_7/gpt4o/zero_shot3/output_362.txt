Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  74  28  19  46  21  26
1  21  69  61   4  47  51  33
2  40  94   8  74  68  58  53
3   3  42  69  32  94   1  32
4  32  59  47  16  72  83  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [32 59 47 16 72 83 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. We will consider the agents' preferences and attempt to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0: [52, 74, 28, 19, 46, 21, 26]
- Agent 1: [21, 69, 61, 4, 47, 51, 33]
- Agent 2: [40, 94, 8, 74, 68, 58, 53]
- Agent 3: [3, 42, 69, 32, 94, 1, 32]
- Agent 4: [32, 59, 47, 16, 72, 83, 75]

We should attempt to allocate items to agents where they have relatively higher valuations compared to others.

Based on the valuations, a potential fair allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (highest value for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (highest value for agent 1)
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 5 (highest values for agent 2)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (highest value for agent 3)
- Agent 4: Items 3 and 6 (highest values for agent 4)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly while distributing all 7 items fairly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```
