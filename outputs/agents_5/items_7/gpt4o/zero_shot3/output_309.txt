Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  34  76  38  78  55  22
1  49  20  96  71  27   5  74
2  76  14  39  66  45  72  40
3  80  12  78  72  34  25  46
4  67   1  82   3  66  34  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will try to distribute the items in such a way that each agent's valuation for their allocated items is relatively high compared to the other options available.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 2, which is 76. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest, but since it is already taken, we allocate item 3 to Agent 1, valued at 71.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5, which is 72. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 0, which is 80. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the highest, at 97. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
6. Now we have items 1 and 4 left. Agent 0 values item 4 highly at 78, so we allocate it to Agent 0.
7. The last item, 1, is valued highest by Agent 0 and Agent 3, both at a lower valuation compared to what they have. To balance it out, we can allocate item 1 to Agent 3 as Agent 0 already has two items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.
