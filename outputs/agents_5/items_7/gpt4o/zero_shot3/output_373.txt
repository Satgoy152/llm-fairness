Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  12  82  18  19  94  60
1  22  94  42  88  80  47  28
2  66  13  85  96  35  27  33
3  22  36  81  88  91  96  61
4  67  55   2  95  46   6  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value for each agent. This involves assigning items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring an equal distribution of items among the agents.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 88 by agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 94 by agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 85 by agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 96 by agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 91 by agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 96 by agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 60 by agent 0.

Now, let's allocate the items, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3
- Agent 3: Items 4, 5
- Agent 4: No items

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with no agent receiving more than 2 items, and every agent receiving at least one item where possible.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": []
}
```
