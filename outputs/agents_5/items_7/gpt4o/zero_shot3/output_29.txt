Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  27  90  98   7  53  58
1  82  62   0  53  77  24   3
2  99   9  75  72   7  83  28
3  74  70  72   6  11  30  26
4  40   4  78  86  80  69  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here is a step-by-step allocation plan:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value by agent 2 (99).
   - Allocate to agent 2.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest value by agent 0 (27).
   - Allocate to agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value by agent 0 (90).
   - Allocate to agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value by agent 0 (98).
   - Allocate to agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value by agent 4 (80).
   - Allocate to agent 4.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest value by agent 2 (83).
   - Allocate to agent 2.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Highest value by agent 4 (89).
   - Allocate to agent 4.

Now, let's ensure that each agent is considered, and adjust if necessary to balance fairness:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: No items allocated. We can consider reallocating item 3 to agent 1 for fairness since agent 0 already has two other high-value items.
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 3: No items allocated. We need to ensure fairness for agent 3.
- Agent 4: Items [4, 6]

Let's adjust to ensure every agent gets at least one item:

- Reallocate item 3 to agent 1.
- Since agent 3 has no items, consider reallocating item 6 from agent 4 to agent 3.

Updated allocation to ensure fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 3: Item [6]
- Agent 4: Item [4]

So, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
