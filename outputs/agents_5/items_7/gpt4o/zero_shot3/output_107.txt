Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4   0  86  86  87  87  34
1  49  36  75  20   7  96  16
2  17  49  32  50  34  15  60
3  94  11  95  53  39  86  17
4   7  73   3   9  13  87   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this, considering the given valuations:

1. Prioritize allocations based on the highest valuation for each item.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, while balancing the overall distribution.

Let's go through the table and allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it highest at 94.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it highest at 73.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it highest at 95.
- Item 3: Agent 0 and Agent 3 both value it at 86. We give it to Agent 0 for balance.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it highest at 87.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it highest at 96.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it highest at 60.

Now, let's see the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
