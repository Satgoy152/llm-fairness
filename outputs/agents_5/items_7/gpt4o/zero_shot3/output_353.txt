Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  28   4   3  43  81  81
1  12  63  52  72  36  87  68
2  72  49  53  61  53   8   9
3  76  54   8  64  58  40  41
4  97  39  41  97  73  11  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. We'll go through each item and try to allocate it to the agent that values it the most. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most at 97.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 63.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 53.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it the most at 97.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it the most at 73.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most at 87.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most at 81.

Given these allocations, the items are distributed as follows:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [0, 3, 4]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, respecting the integer allocation constraint for each agent. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
