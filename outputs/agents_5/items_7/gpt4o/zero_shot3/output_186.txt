Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  24  14  25  59  70  45
1   9  49  32  55  56  43  10
2  99  32  54   6  18  11  45
3  97  94  27  27  62  55  25
4  60   4  85  85  45  48  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 9 49 32 55 56 43 10]
 [99 32 54  6 18 11 45]

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the individual valuations in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 0.
- Agent 1 has a strong preference for item 3.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most, but since Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0, we'll assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 4 has high valuation for items 2, 3, and 6.

Using these considerations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets items 2, 4, and 6.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
