Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  74  20  97   2   6  13
1  29  64   5  89  29  15  91
2  19  86  71   3  41  67  71
3  80   4  91  27  41  40  35
4  82  16  67  77   1  31  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations and ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Valuations: [75, 29, 19, 80, 82]
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 4 (82)

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Valuations: [74, 64, 86, 4, 16]
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 2 (86)

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Valuations: [20, 5, 71, 91, 67]
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 3 (91)

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Valuations: [97, 89, 3, 27, 77]
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 0 (97)

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Valuations: [2, 29, 41, 41, 1]
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 2 (41)
   - Note: Here, agent 2 and 3 have the same valuation, but agent 2 is chosen to balance the allocation.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Valuations: [6, 15, 67, 40, 31]
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 2 (67)

7. **Item 6:**
   - Valuations: [13, 91, 71, 35, 89]
   - Highest Valuation: Agent 1 (91)

Based on these valuations, the allocations can be made as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 4, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while also balancing the number of items allocated to each agent as fairly as possible given the constraints.
