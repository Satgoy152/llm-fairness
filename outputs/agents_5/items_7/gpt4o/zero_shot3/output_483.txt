Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  69  10  40   3  20  12
1  60  52   9  45  98  39  90
2  35  50  25   6  86  82  17
3  67  53  87  28  51   1   3
4  91  93  30   1  65  24  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We'll consider each agent's preferences and distribute the items accordingly. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value items: 0 (87), 1 (69)
   - Allocated items: [0, 1]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 4 (98)
   - Allocated items: [4]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 5 (82)
   - Allocated items: [5]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value items: 2 (87)
   - Allocated items: [2]

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest value items: 6 (31), 3 (1) - Remaining items
   - Allocated items: [6, 3]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to exactly one agent, and all agents receive at least one item.
