Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  79  88  54  36   3  39
1   8  12  68  23  33  70  75
2  89  25  97  55  57  40  65
3  68  54  41  43  54  61  22
4  57  91  30  53  60  17  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent gets a fair share. A fair approach can be to initially allocate items based on the highest valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and that all items are distributed.

Let's consider the valuations and assign the items step by step:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 97. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it at 89, which is the highest. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 70. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 75. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it the highest at 60. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the highest at 91. Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
7. **Item 3**: Agent 0 has the next highest value at 54. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

Let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, where possible. Agent 3 does not receive any items as their valuations did not compete strongly against others for the remaining items, given the constraint of having exactly 7 items allocated.
