Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  57  29  34  67  64  95
1   8  61  91  20  86  77  60
2  13  59   6  27  96   7  74
3  88  40  65  16  29  91  13
4  16  66  30  63  43   7  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuations for all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 95. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

2. Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 91. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. Agent 2:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 96. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. Agent 3:
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 88. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. Agent 4:
   - Agent 4 values item 1 the highest at 66. Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, we've allocated 5 out of 7 items. The remaining items to allocate are 3 and 5. Let's allocate them based on the next highest values:

6. Remaining allocations:
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3, as they value it at 91, which is higher than any other agent's valuation for this item.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4, as they value it at 63, which is higher than any other agent's valuation for this item.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

This way, all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, with consideration to their valuations.
