Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  65   8  97  19  84  96
1   3  86  89  85  82  72  94
2  95  71  14  22   5  43  49
3  36  62   0  25  57  42  55
4  20  10  67  20   5  12  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by allocating items based on their valuations while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item and all 7 items are allocated. Here's one approach to achieving this:

1. **Agent 0:** Prefers item 3 with a value of 97.
2. **Agent 1:** Prefers item 2 with a value of 89.
3. **Agent 2:** Prefers item 0 with a value of 95.
4. **Agent 3:** Prefers item 1 with a value of 62.
5. **Agent 4:** Prefers item 2 with a value of 67.

Since item 2 is preferred by two agents (Agent 1 and Agent 4), we allocate it to the one with the highest valuation for it, which is Agent 1. Then, we adjust the allocation for Agent 4.

Let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0:** Already has item 3.
- **Agent 1:** Already has item 2.
- **Agent 2:** Already has item 0.
- **Agent 3:** Already has item 1.
- **Agent 4:** We give item 4, which has the highest remaining valuation for Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 5 and 6. Let's assign them to the agents with the next highest valuations:

- **Agent 0** gets item 6 (value 96).
- **Agent 1** gets item 5 (value 72).

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
