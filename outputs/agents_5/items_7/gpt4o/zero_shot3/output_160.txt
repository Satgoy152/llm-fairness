Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  99  56  74  13  28  66
1  98  33  69  95  57  48  28
2  59  86  63  66  15   5  15
3  50  58  85  94  44  96  90
4   5   5  38   8  94  45  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5  5 38  8 94 45 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. To achieve this, we can use a simple greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while making sure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's how the allocation might look:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from Agent 1 (98).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from Agent 0 (99).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from Agent 3 (85).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from Agent 3 (94).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from Agent 4 (94).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is from Agent 3 (96).
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is from Agent 3 (90).

However, assigning 4 items to Agent 3 and none to others except Agent 1 may not be fair, so we try to distribute items as evenly as possible while respecting the preferences. 

Revised allocation based on fairness:

- Assign some items to agents with the second highest valuation if an agent is getting too many items.

Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Item 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Item 6
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 4**: Items 4, 5

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed, balancing between fairness and maximizing valuations.
