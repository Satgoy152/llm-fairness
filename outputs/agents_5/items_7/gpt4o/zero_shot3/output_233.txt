Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  62   4  90  48  86  52
1  99  70  95  68  97  76   8
2  23  27  53  11  69  25  94
3  99  75  51  33  51  27   6
4  24  26  94  92  87  55  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach that considers both the valuation of items by each agent and the need to distribute all items among the agents. The aim is to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent and allocate them if possible.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Make sure all items are allocated.

Using these steps, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the most (90), so allocate item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the most (99), so allocate item 0.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the most (94), so allocate item 6.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the most (99), but it's allocated, so allocate next highest item 1 (75).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 3 the most (92), but it's allocated, so allocate next highest item 2 (94).

Now, items 4 and 5 remain unallocated. Allocate these remaining items to agents who have lower total values or fewer items:

- **Agent 0**: Currently has 1 item (item 3). Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 as they have interest in it (86).
- **Agent 4**: Currently has 1 item (item 2). Allocate item 4 to Agent 4 as they have interest in it (87).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while trying to respect the preferences of each agent as much as possible.
