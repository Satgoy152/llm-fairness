Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  17  70  50  80  98  91
1  32  35  55  43  91   1  84
2  69   1  13  40  25  39  16
3  79  28  72  63  26  25  70
4  62  70  42  67  89  20  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the overall satisfaction (based on the valuations) while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. One common approach is to use a form of the "maximum weighted matching" problem, but for simplicity, we will try a straightforward heuristic here.

Let's start by examining the highest valuations for each item and assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 79.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most at 70.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 70.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it the most at 67.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 98.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.

We initially assign based on highest valuation, but we need to ensure fair distribution. Agents 2 and 3 currently receive no items, so we adjust:

- Move **Item 1** from Agent 4 to Agent 2.
- Move **Item 6** from Agent 0 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent gets at least one item, and the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while considering each agent's preferences as much as possible.
