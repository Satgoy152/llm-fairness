Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  14  21  52   2  62  33
1  64   4  47  17  95  36   5
2  19  26  77  12  43  76  10
3  71  55  48  26  34  38  32
4  21  53  85  39  31  52  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider how to distribute the 7 items so that each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible based on the valuations provided.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign the items to the agents based on their highest valuations.

Let's analyze the table and allocate:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 62.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 95.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 77.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 71.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest at 81.

Now, we have allocated five items: 0, 2, 4, 5, and 6. We have two more items to allocate: 1 and 3. The remaining values for these are:

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 14
  - Agent 1: 4
  - Agent 2: 26
  - Agent 3: 55
  - Agent 4: 53

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 52
  - Agent 1: 17
  - Agent 2: 12
  - Agent 3: 26
  - Agent 4: 39

Allocating based on remaining highest valuations:

- Item 1 should go to Agent 3 (value of 55).
- Item 3 should go to Agent 0 (value of 52).

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.
