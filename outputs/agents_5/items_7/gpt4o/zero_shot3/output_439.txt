Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  46  35  77  69  77   4
1  32  86  83  10  68  87  14
2   0  73  12  20  70  40  63
3  57  16  18  83  63   7  95
4  58  21  91  99  49  90   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 46 35 77 69 77  4]
 [32 86 83 10 68 87 14]
 [ 0 73 12 20 70 40 63]

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent can receive any number of items, including none. Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value 97
   - Item 5: Value 77

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1: Value 86
   - Item 2: Value 83

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4: Value 70

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 6: Value 95

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 3: Value 99

This allocation ensures each item is allocated, and every agent is considered in the distribution process. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
