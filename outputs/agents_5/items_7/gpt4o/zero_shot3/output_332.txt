Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  74  35  85  38  91  59
1  69  23  37  63  42  98  29
2  63  72   0  98  98  81  74
3  58  74  10  94  26  50  86
4  97  49  55  98  17  61  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of value. Given that there are 5 agents and 7 items, not every agent will receive the same number of items, but we can try to distribute them so that overall satisfaction is maximized.

Let's look at the highest valuations for each item and allocate accordingly, while also ensuring that all items are distributed:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (97).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 and Agent 3 (both 74). Choose one, e.g., Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (55).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agents 2 and 4 (both 98). Choose one, e.g., Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agents 2 and 4 (both 98). Choose one, e.g., Agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (98).
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (86).

With these preferences, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item (where possible) and distribute the items:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 0, 2, 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 2, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation distributes all items while trying to respect the highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
