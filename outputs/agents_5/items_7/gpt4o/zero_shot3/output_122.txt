Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  14   4  83  49   5  74
1  88  16  63  58   1  13  38
2  86   2  24  16  33  82   2
3  49  49  54   5  17  77  20
4  10  27  87  17  19  21  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute them such that agents receive items with high valuations, maximizing total satisfaction. We must ensure that each agent receives at least one item due to the constraint of integer allocations, and all 7 items must be allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 highly (83).
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (88).
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly (82).
- Agent 3 values item 2 fairly high (54).
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly (27).

After allocating one item to each agent, we have two items left (items 4 and 6). We will allocate these based on the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0 also values item 6 highly (74).
- Agent 4 values item 4 higher than the other agents (19).

This leads us to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.
