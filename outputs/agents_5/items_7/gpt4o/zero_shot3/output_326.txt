Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  15  63  52  87   0  99
1  18  19  53  99  81  89  78
2  34  11  19  17  56  33  14
3  11  26  74  91  47  72  21
4  53  27  35  53   0  11  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 27 35 53  0 11 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, while maximizing overall satisfaction. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 6 (99), so we allocate it to them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 (99) the most, so we give them this item.
3. **Agent 2**: Given the relatively low valuations, we'll assign them item 5 (33), which is one of their higher valued items.
4. **Agent 3**: They value item 3 (91) the most, but since it's already taken, we assign them item 2 (74).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for agent 4 is item 6 (94), which is already taken. Therefore, we assign them item 0 (53), the next highest value.

Let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item and there are no overlaps:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 0

Now, we have the following items left: 1 and 4. We distribute these based on remaining value:

- Agent 0 values item 4 (87) the most, so we assign it to them.
- Agent 1 values item 1 (19) as their next best option, so we assign it to them.

This way, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
