Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  41  54  87   9  38  39
1  91  97  63  58  25  50  27
2  56  75  35   5  24  30  96
3  75  80  20  91  71   6  68
4   7  79   3   0  46  19  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here’s a possible allocation:

1. Start by evaluating each agent's highest valued item, and try to allocate that item to the respective agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let’s allocate the items step by step:

- **Agent 0**: The highest value item is item 3 (87). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: The highest value item is item 1 (97). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: The highest value item is item 6 (96). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: The highest value item is item 3 (91), but it's taken. The next highest is item 0 (75). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: The highest value item is item 1 (79), but it's taken. The next highest is item 4 (46). Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Now we have two items left (2 and 5) and need to ensure all items are allocated:

- **Remaining items: 2 and 5**

Continue allocating the remaining items based on next highest value:

- **Agent 1**: Assign item 2 (63) to Agent 1 because it has the highest remaining value for Agent 1.
- **Agent 0**: Assign item 5 (38) to Agent 0 because it has the highest remaining value for Agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, all items are allocated, and attempts to maximize the value for each agent as best as possible.
