Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90   6  55  44  39  91  33
1  29  66  31   8   3  55  29
2  26   5  80  44  50  92  51
3  88  25   7  19  47  47  66
4   6  85   9  97  18  82  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and aim to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One common approach is to use a method like the "Envy-Free" allocation, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 5. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highly. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 and 5 highly. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 highly but it's already taken. Assign item 6 to Agent 3, which is one of the higher-valued remaining items.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 highly. Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
6. Item 4 is one of the remaining items. Assign it to Agent 4 to balance the allocation.

Given these considerations, here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items based on the agents' preferences while ensuring each agent receives an item.
