Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  20  58  46  68  76  88
1  24  23  21  40  24   4  40
2  55   1  76   0  32  67  72
3  76  88  80  46  77  64  17
4  33  31  86  33  44   7   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive one item while others may receive two.

We will consider the highest valuations first and assign items accordingly, ensuring each item is allocated exactly once.

1. Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 88 for item 1.
2. Agent 0 has the highest valuation of 88 for item 6.
3. Agent 3 also values item 0 at 76, which is the next highest unallocated item.
4. Agent 2 highly values item 2 at 76.
5. Agent 0 highly values item 5 at 76.
6. Agent 0 also values item 4 at 68.
7. Agent 4 values item 3 at 33.

Now, let's assign the items:

- Agent 0 gets items 4, 5, and 6.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 3.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent's allocation remains integer-based.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
