Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  18  62  39  39  35   8
1  97  30  92  38  83  21  74
2  94  83  86  99  96  49  35
3  19   1  12  55  70  15  62
4  45  48  63  59  80  97  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.

Let's examine the table and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (99) and also for item 4 (96). Let's allocate both items to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 0 (97) and item 2 (92). Let's allocate these two items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 5 (97). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
4. **Agent 3** has a decent valuation for item 6 (62). Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 0** is left with item 1. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Thus, each item is allocated to an agent, and each agent has at least one item where feasible.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing all 7 items among the 5 agents.
