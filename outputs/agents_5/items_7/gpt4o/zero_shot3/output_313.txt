Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  22  33  14  52   0  26
1  43  37  62  91  65  56  55
2  78  37  50  63  45   0  69
3  93  87  66  79  20  88  52
4  91  56  35  12  61  81  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. We'll aim to distribute the items such that the total value of items received by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuation is highest for items 4 and 0. Allocate item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuation is highest for items 3 and 4. Allocate item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Valuation is highest for item 0. Allocate item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Valuation is highest for items 0 and 5. Allocate item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Valuation is highest for item 6. Allocate item 6.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We have two items left to allocate, which are items 1 and 2.

Continue with allocation:

6. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1.
7. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2.

This ensures that all items are allocated and each agent has received at least one item.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6, 2]
}
```
