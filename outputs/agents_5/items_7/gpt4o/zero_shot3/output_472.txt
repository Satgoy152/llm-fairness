Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  75  42  37  49  13  71
1  12  78  15  49  16   5  68
2  36  11  36  67   0  21  64
3  43  21  33  10  39  89  91
4  96  92  50   7  71  63  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Given the constraint of 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

Let's approach this by considering the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 1 (75), Item 6 (71)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations: Item 1 (78), Item 6 (68)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations: Item 3 (67), Item 6 (64)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: Item 5 (89), Item 6 (91)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - High valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 1 (92)

We can distribute items to maximize the total valuation per agent while ensuring all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 receives Items 0 and 6 due to high valuation.
- Agent 1 receives Item 1.
- Agent 2 receives Item 3.
- Agent 3 receives Item 5.
- Agent 4 receives Item 4 and 2.

Now, let's assign the items:

1. Agent 0: [0, 6]
2. Agent 1: [1]
3. Agent 2: [3]
4. Agent 3: [5]
5. Agent 4: [2, 4]

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
