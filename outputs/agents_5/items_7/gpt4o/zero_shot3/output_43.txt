Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  33  58  65  38  60  21
1  60  79  67  50  52  21  39
2  46  65  99  47  19   3  85
3  58  80  62  26  72  63  42
4  88  62  30  24  66  44  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value. Hereâ€™s one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items to understand their overall preferences.
2. Use a simple allocation strategy such as a Greedy Algorithm to distribute items based on the highest available value for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
3. Assign items to agents while attempting to balance total values received by each agent.

Based on the above considerations, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 4.
- Agent 4 highly values item 5.

Assigning based on these preferences and the constraint that each agent gets at least one item, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [5, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while distributing all items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```
