Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  59  33  60  22  20  51
1  27   7  10  12  86  46  52
2  94  99  31  41   5  58  71
3  21  12   4  96  80  85  97
4  41  33  30  54  22  86   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One method to achieve this is to use a greedy approach where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here is one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values item 0 the most with a valuation of 94.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values item 1 the most with a valuation of 99.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values item 2 the most with a valuation of 33.
4. Item 3: Agent 3 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 96.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values item 4 the most with a valuation of 86.
6. Item 5: Agent 4 values item 5 the most with a valuation of 86.
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values item 6 the most with a valuation of 97.

Based on this assignment, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, the total number of items allocated is 7, and each agent gets an integer number of items.
