Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  90  99   8  26  79  68
1  89  32   0  20  92  72  55
2   1  50  56  95  65  78  25
3  81  82  96  17  83  79  22
4  78  42  24  17  29  89  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to take into consideration each agent's valuations and aim for an allocation where each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. First, identify the highest value each agent places on any item and try to allocate those items to them if possible.
2. Sequentially allocate items to agents based on the highest remaining valuations to ensure fairness.

Now let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (99) and item 1 (90), so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (89), so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (95), so allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2 (96), but it's already allocated, so consider the second-highest, item 1 (82), and allocate it to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 5 (89), so allocate item 5 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. We still need to allocate items 4 and 6.

6. For item 4, agent 1 has the highest unallocated value (92), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
7. For item 6, agent 0 has the highest unallocated value (68), so allocate item 6 to agent 0.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [5]

In JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
