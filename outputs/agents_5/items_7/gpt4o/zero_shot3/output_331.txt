Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  47  20  72  39  19   6
1  85  60  88  98  86  40  50
2  24   9  62  29  63  58   5
3  54  32  53  61  26  90  49
4  50  99  50   0  92  57  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives. We'll do this by considering each agent's preference for the items based on their valuations.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for items 3 (72) and 0 (58).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations are for items 3 (98), 2 (88), and 4 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 4 (63).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 5 (90).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 1 (99).

Let's allocate based on these preferences while ensuring each agent gets some items and all 7 items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 3
- **Agent 2**: Item 4
- **Agent 3**: Item 5
- **Agent 4**: Items 1 and 6

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```
