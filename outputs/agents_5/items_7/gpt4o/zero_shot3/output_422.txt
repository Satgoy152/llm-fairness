Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  75  58  99  14   4  97
1  30  81   4  37  85  62  51
2  23  16  11  31  10  84  74
3  75  31  89  55  93  29  72
4  33  54  38  36  13  19  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. We will consider each agent's highest valued items while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. Assign items to agents based on their preferences while ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (99) and item 6 (97).
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 (81) and item 4 (85).
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (84) and item 6 (74).
- Agent 3 highly values item 2 (89) and item 4 (93).
- Agent 4 highly values item 1 (54) and item 3 (36).

We can assign based on these preferences while resolving conflicts:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
7. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 0],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items according to their valuations, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
