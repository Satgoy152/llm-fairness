Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84   2  90  48  22  14  66
1   7  30   5  71  34  29  34
2  71  77  45  67   7  93   3
3  53  41  57  28  77  57  63
4  97  96  42  28  73  29  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 96 42 28 73 29 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated, and each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Assign the items based on the highest value each agent places on unallocated items.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate the items according to the criteria:

- **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (value 90), so let's assign item 2 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (value 71), so let's assign item 3 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 5 the most (value 93), so let's assign item 5 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 4 the most (value 77), so let's assign item 4 to agent 3.
- **Agent 4** values item 0 the most (value 97), so let's assign item 0 to agent 4.

Now we have items 1 and 6 left. Let's assign these to maximize the remaining values:

- Agent 4 highly values item 1 (value 96), so let's assign item 1 to agent 4.
- Agent 0 highly values item 6 (value 66), so let's assign item 6 to agent 0.

This allocation satisfies the requirement that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
