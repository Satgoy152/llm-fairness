Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  22  32   9  91  28  26
1  53  32  43  33  65  80  63
2  63   7  98  90  92  26  38
3  72  75  99   6  47  36  39
4  85  97  81  42  36  51  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction (or value) that each agent gains from the items they receive. We also want to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values are [50, 22, 32, 9, 91, 28, 26]. The highest value is for item 4, which is 91.
2. **Agent 1**: Values are [53, 32, 43, 33, 65, 80, 63]. The highest value is for item 5, which is 80.
3. **Agent 2**: Values are [63, 7, 98, 90, 92, 26, 38]. The highest value is for item 2, which is 98.
4. **Agent 3**: Values are [72, 75, 99, 6, 47, 36, 39]. The highest value is for item 2, which is 99, but since item 2 is already assigned, the next highest is item 1, which is 75.
5. **Agent 4**: Values are [85, 97, 81, 42, 36, 51, 66]. The highest value is for item 1, which is 97, but since item 1 is already assigned, the next highest is item 0, which is 85.

After assigning the highest available, we continue allocating the remaining items:

- Agent 2's next highest unallocated is item 3 (value 90).
- Agent 4's next highest unallocated is item 6 (value 66).
- Agent 3's next highest unallocated is item 0 (value 72).

Now, let's compile the allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 0],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, the total number of items allocated is 7, and the allocation maximizes the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
