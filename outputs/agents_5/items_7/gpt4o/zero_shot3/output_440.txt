Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  86  19  12  23  36  44
1  60  60  31  51  54  75  61
2  41  61  22  97  39  81  82
3  56  88  21  59  22  75  68
4  14  61  56  76  78  69   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the overall satisfaction by ensuring that each agent receives items that they value the most. We will try to allocate the items such that the sum of valuations is balanced across agents as much as possible.

Here is a possible fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 1 (86) the most, so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 (75) the most, so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 3 (97) the most, so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 1 (88) but it's already allocated, so we allocate the next highest valued item, item 0 (56), to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 4 (78) the most, so we allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate 2 more items. We can consider the remaining items and distribute them based on the remaining valuations:

6. **Remaining items (2 and 6)**: 
   - Item 2 is valued at 56 by agent 4 and 31 by agent 1. Allocating it to agent 4 seems reasonable.
   - Item 6 is valued at 82 by agent 2 and 68 by agent 3. Allocating it to agent 2 would balance the allocation better.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent gets items they value relatively highly, and all 7 items are allocated.
