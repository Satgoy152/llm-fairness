Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  41  86  85  76  41  69
1  54  29  13   0   9  30  55
2  81  41  53  61  98  41  57
3  46  63  99  23  93   7  19
4   7  19  19  28  73  36  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. **Assign the highest valued items first:**
   - Agent 3 highly values item 2 (value of 99), so assign item 2 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 4 (value of 98), so assign item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (value of 57), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Continue assigning based on remaining high valuations:**
   - Agent 2 also values item 3 (value of 61), so assign item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 0 highly values item 6 (value of 69), so assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 5 (value of 30), so assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 4 is left with item 1 (value of 19), so assign item 1 to Agent 4.

3. **Double-check all items are assigned and include all agents:**
   - Ensure each agent is included, even if they receive no items.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item (except for Agent 4, who receives only item 1 due to lower valuations), and all items are distributed.
