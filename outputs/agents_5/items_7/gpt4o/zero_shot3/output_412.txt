Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  12  58  50   3  25  77
1  73  64  80  79  47   1  75
2  26  13  92  16  72  29  20
3  67  41   3  53  26  92  97
4   7  39  65  15  90  84   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents. A reasonable approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0:** The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (87). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (64). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (92). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3:** The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (79). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4:** The highest valuation is by Agent 4 (90). Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Item 5:** The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (92). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
7. **Item 6:** The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (97). Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

After these allocations, all items are distributed, and each agent has at least one item. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and agents receive items they value highly.
