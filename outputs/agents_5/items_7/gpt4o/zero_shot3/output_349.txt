Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  55  56  49  49  44  17
1  21  70  85  92  71  34  21
2  89   7  20  18  71  22  60
3  52  53  16  63  81  67  16
4   9  85  15  46  51  44  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. One way to do this is by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and aiming for a fair distribution. 

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [80, 55, 56, 49, 49, 44, 17]
- Agent 1: [21, 70, 85, 92, 71, 34, 21]
- Agent 2: [89, 7, 20, 18, 71, 22, 60]
- Agent 3: [52, 53, 16, 63, 81, 67, 16]
- Agent 4: [9, 85, 15, 46, 51, 44, 28]

Let's assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring a fair distribution wherever possible:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (89).
2. Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (85).
3. Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (85).
4. Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (92).
5. Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (81).
6. Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (67).
7. Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (60).

Now, let's distribute the items to ensure each agent gets at least one item. Since Agent 0 has not been allocated any items, we will re-evaluate the allocation to give Agent 0 one item with a reasonably high valuation.

Revising the allocation:

- Item 0: Assigned to Agent 0 (80), instead of Agent 2.
- Item 1: Assigned to Agent 4 (85).
- Item 2: Assigned to Agent 1 (85).
- Item 3: Assigned to Agent 1 (92).
- Item 4: Assigned to Agent 3 (81).
- Item 5: Assigned to Agent 3 (67).
- Item 6: Assigned to Agent 2 (60).

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the allocations are as fair as possible based on the valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
