Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  63  29  65  76  93  74
1  12  65  99  13  22  51  71
2  42  43  58   3  38  83  33
3  49   0  16  26  89  10  49
4  27  80   6  85  15  81  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (93). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (99). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 6 (33). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 4 the most (89). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 values item 1 the most (80). Assign item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, the remaining items are 0 and 3. We need to distribute these fairly among the agents to maximize their valuations.

6. **Remaining Distribution**:
   - Item 3 has the highest valuation from Agent 4 (85), but since Agent 4 already has an item, let's consider others. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (65) after their top choice, so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Item 0 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (42) among the remaining unallocated, assign item 0 to Agent 2.

Now we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are assigned and each agent gets at least one item.
