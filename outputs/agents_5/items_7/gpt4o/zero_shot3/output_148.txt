Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  62  22  82  81  61  78
1  73  80  52   0  16  27   2
2   3  72  69  14  64  94  72
3  51  84  86   0  56  30  49
4  71  58   2  85  36  48  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [71 58  2 85 36 48 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Items that Agent 0 values highly are items 3 and 4. Let's allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Items that Agent 1 values highly are items 0 and 1. Let's allocate these to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 5 has a high valuation for Agent 2. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 is valued highly by Agent 3. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Item 6 has a decent valuation for Agent 4. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item while also respecting the valuations. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6]
}
```
