Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  24  77   0  48  42  62
1  84  63  76  38   5  38  71
2  52  76  65  26  59  99  40
3   0   7  49  33  67  82   4
4  45  93  75  11  68  67  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We aim to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Let's consider a simple greedy approach where each agent takes turns picking the item that they value the most among the remaining unallocated items. Here's how we can proceed:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest value for item 2 (77). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest value for item 0 (84). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest value for item 5 (99). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest value for item 5 (82), but it's already taken. Next highest value for item 4 (67). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

5. Agent 4:
   - Highest value for item 1 (93). Assign item 1 to Agent 4.

Now each agent has received one item. We need to allocate the remaining two items (3 and 6).

6. For the remaining items, let's allocate based on maximizing the next highest value:

   - Item 3: 
     - Agent 1 values item 3 at 38, which seems to be the highest for this item. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

   - Item 6:
     - Agent 1 values item 6 at 71, which is the highest among the remaining agents. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

Final allocation of items:

Agent 0: [2]  
Agent 1: [0, 3, 6]  
Agent 2: [5]  
Agent 3: [4]  
Agent 4: [1]  

In JSON format, the allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
