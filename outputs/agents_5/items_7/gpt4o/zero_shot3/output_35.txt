Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  63   5   6  58   7  89
1  31  34  77  45   4  67  83
2  21  49  25   3  42  53   0
3  43  69  88  25  40  13  83
4  94  13  68  61  45  78  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is based on maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 6 with a valuation of 89.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 with a valuation of 77.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 5 with a valuation of 53.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 2 with a valuation of 88, but it's already taken, so we choose item 1 with a valuation of 69.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 0 with a valuation of 94.

After assigning these, we have distributed 5 items. We need to distribute 2 more items. We will allocate the remaining items to maximize the total valuation:

- **Remaining items**: Items 3 and 4.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, since it's unallocated and Agent 3 values it at 25.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as it's unallocated and Agent 4 values it at 45.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all 7 items are allocated.
