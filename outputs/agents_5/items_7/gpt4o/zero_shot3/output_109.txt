Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  20   7  18   9  59  79
1  34  92  81  15  63  18  11
2  13  12  99  60  27  67  96
3  14  89  57  51  53  65  27
4  86  19  19  26  91  10  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to try and maximize the total utility (sum of valuations) for each agent. Given that there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but we aim for a balanced distribution based on their valuations.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying each agent's highest valued item and consider giving them items they value highly.

2. Ensure that each item is assigned to one agent only.

3. Ensure that the allocation maximizes overall satisfaction (i.e., maximizes the sum of the values from the agents' perspectives).

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 0 (value of 86).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 1 (value of 92).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 2 (value of 99).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 1 (value of 89), but it's already taken by agent 1. Next best is item 5 (value of 65).
- **Agent 4**: Highest value is item 4 (value of 91).

Now, assign the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6 (value of 79).
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value of 15).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives item 5.
- Agent 4 receives item 4.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```
