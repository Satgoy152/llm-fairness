Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  24  72  61  32  72  22
1  56  79   5  78  47  64  31
2  59  68   5  45  31  97  73
3  53  37  58  98  62  55  67
4  55  89  43  98  74  78  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given there are 5 agents and 7 items, two agents will receive two items each, and three agents will receive one item each. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Determine the highest valuations for each agent and allocate items accordingly.
2. Ensure no item is allocated more than once and that all items are allocated.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

- Start by allocating the highest valued available item to each agent.
- After each agent has been allocated one item, allocate the remaining items to the agents based on the next highest available valuations.

Here's a possible allocation based on the table:

1. Agent 0: Selects item 0 (value 93)
2. Agent 1: Selects item 1 (value 79)
3. Agent 2: Selects item 5 (value 97)
4. Agent 3: Selects item 3 (value 98)
5. Agent 4: Selects item 4 (value 74)

Now, allocate the remaining items (2 and 6):

6. Agent 0: Selects item 2 (value 72)
7. Agent 4: Selects item 6 (value 51)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
