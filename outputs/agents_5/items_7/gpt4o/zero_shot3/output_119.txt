Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  78  79  83   3   1  15
1  16  62  86  66  85  57  84
2  59  98  69   9  23  16  68
3  21  69  43  67  23  99  83
4  72  16  75   6  69  42  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Sort each agent's item valuations** to determine which items they value the most.
2. **Allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction** by prioritizing higher valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. **Check for any unallocated items** and distribute them to the agents who value them the most without exceeding the total of 7 items.

Let's consider the valuations and attempt an allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest values for items 3, 2, and 1.
- Agent 1: Highest values for items 2, 6, and 4.
- Agent 2: Highest values for items 1, 0, and 6.
- Agent 3: Highest values for items 5, 6, and 3.
- Agent 4: Highest values for items 0, 2, and 4.

Now, let's make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 3 (highest value for agent 0).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2 (highest value for agent 1).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 1 (highest value for agent 2 after item 2 is taken).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 5 (highest value for agent 3).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 0 (highest value for agent 4).

Now, we have two remaining items to allocate: items 4 and 6.

6. **Allocate item 6**: 
   - Agent 1 values it at 84, but already has item 2 (value 86).
   - Agent 2 values it at 68, could be a good fit.
   - Agent 3 values it at 83, already has item 5 (value 99).
   - Allocate item 6 to **Agent 2**.

7. **Allocate item 4**:
   - Agent 1 values it at 85, currently has item 2 (value 86).
   - Agent 4 values it at 69, currently has item 0 (value 72).
   - Allocate item 4 to **Agent 1** as it has a higher valuation for it.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are distributed.
