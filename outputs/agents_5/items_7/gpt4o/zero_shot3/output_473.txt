Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  12  90  33  10  71  41
1  37  90  10  61  49  41  56
2  25  95   8  56  99  89  73
3  90  36  99  83  50  37  76
4  18  85  13  89  60  98  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [25 95  8 56 99 89 73]

 [18 85 13 89 60 98 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure each agent's preferences are taken into account while distributing the 7 items. One way to approach this allocation is by maximizing the total valuation for all agents or ensuring each agent receives at least one of their preferred items if possible. Let's try to allocate the items in a balanced way based on their valuations:

1. Identify the highest value for each item and allocate that item to the agent with the highest valuation for it. If two agents value an item equally, we will choose based on the overall allocation balance.

2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (90).
- Item 1: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (95).
- Item 2: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (99).
- Item 3: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (89).
- Item 4: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (99).
- Item 5: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (98).
- Item 6: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (76).

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent with one of the highest valuations for it while distributing the items fairly.
