Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  49  76  10  80   1  16
1   3  31  43  10  16  59  88
2  42  51  12  57  17  90  10
3  45  23  40   2  52  44  88
4   0  76  37  91  86  82  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the five agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their own valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's allocate the items using a strategy that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the most (80).
2. Assign item 6 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the most (88).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the most (90).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it the most (91).
5. Assign item 1 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it highly (76).
6. Assign item 0 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it highly (45).
7. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it highly (76).

After assigning the items as described, the allocations can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.
