Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  41  58   6  50  74   2
1  30  60  16  48  81  60  84
2  54  86  72  51  58  46  50
3  88  77  19  11  17  97   2
4   5  17  73  13  64  37   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 17 73 13 64 37  5]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for all agents. We will assign items to agents based on their preferences, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible and that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets items with the highest value for them: items 5 and 2.
2. Agent 1 gets items with the highest value for them: item 4.
3. Agent 2 gets items with the highest value for them: item 1.
4. Agent 3 gets items with the highest value for them: item 0.
5. Agent 4 gets items with the highest value for them: items 6 and 3.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets items based on their highest preferences.
