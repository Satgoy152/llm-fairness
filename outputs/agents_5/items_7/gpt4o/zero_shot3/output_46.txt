Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  43  41  43  14  83  24
1  87  19  15   2  28  50  18
2  83  85  33  24  74  46  47
3  67   3  44  60  16  26  24
4  75  59   4  35  96  37  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent given the constraints. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0's highest values:** Item 5 (83), Item 1 (43), Item 3 (43), Item 2 (41)
2. **Agent 1's highest values:** Item 0 (87), Item 5 (50)
3. **Agent 2's highest values:** Item 1 (85), Item 0 (83)
4. **Agent 3's highest values:** Item 0 (67), Item 3 (60)
5. **Agent 4's highest values:** Item 4 (96)

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring no item is allocated more than once, and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Assign Item 5
- **Agent 1:** Assign Item 0
- **Agent 2:** Assign Item 1
- **Agent 3:** Assign Item 3
- **Agent 4:** Assign Item 4

Re-evaluate unallocated items:
- Remaining items after initial allocation: Item 2, Item 6
- **Assign Item 2 to Agent 0** for their second-highest value.
- **Assign Item 6 to Agent 4** as it has their third-highest value and no conflict.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their valuations, with all 7 items assigned.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
