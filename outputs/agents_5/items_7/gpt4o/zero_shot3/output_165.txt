Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  24  96  55  25  18  95
1  76  10  55  62  43  33  86
2   1   9  47   3   2  18   8
3  90  61  80  73  45  41  47
4  18  32  38  50  85  21  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the items to the agent who values them the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
3. If any agent ends up with no items after step 1, adjust the allocation to ensure everyone gets at least one item.

Following this strategy, let's make an allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value 96).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value 76).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (value 18) but as it is low, let's reassign it if needed later.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (value 73).
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (value 85).

Now, distribute remaining items:
- Item 1 is valued highly by agent 3 (61), so assign it to agent 3.
- Item 6 is valued highly by agent 0 (95), so assign it to agent 0.

Let's ensure each agent has at least one item:
- Agent 2 needs an item. Reassign item 5 to agent 2.

Here's the revised allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and every agent has at least one item.
