Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  67  47  34   1   7  43
1  99  46  21  40  52  17  15
2   4  94  60  90  64  43  62
3  68  10  46  47  64  79  95
4  32  57  65  65  12  45  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the agents' valuations for each item. One way to do this is to try to maximize the total value received by each agent by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. However, since we must allocate all items and each agent should receive an integer number of items, we'll aim for a balanced allocation while considering these valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values this item the most at 99.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 2 values this item the most at 94.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values this item the most at 47.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 2 values this item the most at 90.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 1 values this item the most at 52.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 3 values this item the most at 79.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 3 values this item the most at 95.

Now, let's put these allocations into a JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Agent 4 does not receive any items in this specific allocation since their highest valuations are not the highest compared to other agents.
