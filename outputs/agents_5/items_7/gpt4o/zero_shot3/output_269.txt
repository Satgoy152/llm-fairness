Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  77  15  81  84  21  79
1  78  18  15  35  56  90  24
2  79  99  85   0  44  27  69
3   7  50  37  16  84  14  70
4  71  46  71   4  14  67  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and allocate based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, ensuring any conflicts are resolved by selecting the item for the agent with the highest valuation among those interested in that item.
2. Once each agent has an item, assign the remaining items by iteratively choosing the unallocated item that, when given to an agent, maximizes the sum total of that agent's assigned item valuations.

Let's allocate the items to agents based on the above strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (96).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5 (90).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 1 (99).
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 4 (84).
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 2 (71).

At this point, each agent has one item and two items are left unallocated: item 3 and item 6.

6. For item 3, the remaining agents (Agent 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) have valuations [81, 35, 0, 16, 4]. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3, so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
7. For item 6, the remaining agents have valuations [79, 24, 69, 70, 41]. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6, so assign item 6 to Agent 3.

Finally, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 7.
