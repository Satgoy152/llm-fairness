Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  29  26  15  27  26  70
1  61  20   5  25  31  62  34
2  67  14  69  84  60  18  45
3  27  96  94  78  35  56  52
4  29   1  77  66  81  43  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 29 26 15 27 26 70]
 [61 20  5 25 31 62 34]
 [67 14 69 84 60 18 45]
 [27 96 94 78 35 56 52]
 [29  1 77 66 81 43 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

Allocations:
- Agent 0 values item 6 the most, so assign item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most, so assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most, so assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most, so assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most, so assign item 4 to agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 2 and 5. Let's find the best remaining allocations:
- Item 2 has the highest valuation for agent 3 (94), so assign item 2 to agent 3.
- Item 5 has the highest remaining valuation for agent 1 (62), so assign item 5 to agent 1.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
