Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  69  29   4  12  72  35
1  41  46  51  20   0  12  17
2  23  10  50  97   1  83  52
3  98  15  28  58  62  59  13
4  34  41  66   6  70  62  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent gets at least one item, while maximizing their total value and ensuring all 7 items are distributed. One approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 5 (Value 72)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 2 (Value 51)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 3 (Value 97)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 0 (Value 98)
5. **Agent 4**: Items 4 and 6 (Values 70 and 37)
6. **Agent 1**: Item 1 (Value 46)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, the total number of items allocated is 7, and the items are distributed in a way that maximizes the overall value for the agents.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
