Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  18  71  35  29  77  99
1  66  89  24  20   3   5  87
2   5  64   9   5   8  96  84
3  66  54  19  47  80  10  64
4  75  97  79  30  71  34  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we want to ensure that the total valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Let's examine the valuations and try to distribute items while maximizing fairness.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is item 6 (99). Next highest is item 0 (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is item 1 (89). Next highest is item 6 (87).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is item 5 (96). Next highest is item 6 (84).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is item 4 (80). Next highest is item 3 (47).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is item 1 (97). Next highest is item 2 (79).

Let's allocate one high-value item to each agent first:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 4
- **Agent 4**: Item 2

Now, we need to allocate the remaining 2 items (0 and 3) to agents while maintaining balance:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 6. High valuation for item 0 (90), so allocate item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 4. Next highest available value is for item 3 (47), so allocate item 3.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items with relatively high valuations for them and balances the total value they receive.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
