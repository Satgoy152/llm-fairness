Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  34   4  64  59  15  15
1  21  98   6  31  76  57  39
2  91  93  89  35  17  85  59
3  88  57  97  96   2  82  13
4  49  20  14  66  46  48   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction of the group, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no agent is left out. Given the constraint that each agent should get an integer amount of items, and there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more than one item while at least one agent will receive only one item.

One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm or auction-style allocation where agents take turns picking their highest-valued items. However, given the need for fairness, I'll strive for an allocation that tries to balance the value received by each agent.

Let's go through a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (value 64).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 91).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 97).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 3, but it is already taken by Agent 0. Next highest is item 5 (value 48).

Now, we have 2 items left: 4 and 6. We will allocate these:

6. **Agent 0**: Next highest valuation is for item 4 (value 59).
7. **Agent 1**: Next highest valuation is for item 6 (value 39).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total value given the constraints.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation gives all items to the agents, ensuring that no item is left unallocated, and each agent receives at least one item.
