Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  23  67   4  83  53  60
1  44  90  85  73  58  81   6
2  25  70  82  18  83  69  98
3  93  46  58  48  60  58  18
4  52  15   1  84  28  65  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and exactly 7 items are allocated in total. One straightforward approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Agent 3 values it highest at 93.

2. **Item 1:** 
   - Agent 1 values it highest at 90.

3. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 1 values it highest at 85.

4. **Item 3:** 
   - Agent 4 values it highest at 84.

5. **Item 4:** 
   - Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it at 83. Let's assign it to Agent 2 (arbitrary choice).

6. **Item 5:** 
   - Agent 1 values it highest at 81.

7. **Item 6:** 
   - Agent 2 values it highest at 98.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
