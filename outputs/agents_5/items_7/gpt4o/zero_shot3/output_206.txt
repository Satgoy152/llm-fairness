Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  58   3  69   0  70  93
1   8  47  79  87  75  22  21
2  76  78  76  26  28  32  77
3  38  71  46   8  82  63  56
4  73  21  37  87  94   7   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to assign items to agents such that the total value each agent receives is maximized based on their preferences. However, since the allocation should be fair and each agent should receive an integer number of items, we'll distribute the items in a way that considers their values while ensuring all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. Allocate item 6 to agent 0 (value 93).
2. Allocate item 3 to agent 1 (value 87).
3. Allocate item 0 to agent 2 (value 76).
4. Allocate item 4 to agent 3 (value 82).
5. Allocate item 5 to agent 4 (value 7).
6. Allocate item 1 to agent 2 (value 78).
7. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (value 79).

This allocation aims to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their highest available valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the 5 agents, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items is 7.
