Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  54  37  36  31  54  59
1  25  56  61  33  77  52  53
2  88  75  28  75  76  35  57
3  12  43  92  38  89  19  95
4  76  54  54  52   8  41  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach by attempting to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. Calculate the maximum valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.
3. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's look at the valuations and assign the items:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 88.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 75.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 92.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 75.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most at 89.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 54.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 95.

However, this allocation leaves Agents 0, 1, and 4 without any items. Let's adjust to ensure all agents get at least one item:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest value after Agent 2).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 4 (next highest valuation).
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
