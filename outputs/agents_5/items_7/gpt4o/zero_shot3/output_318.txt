Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  10  85  77  84   9  36
1  97  76  37  31  26  23  42
2  20  51  60  19  45  60  42
3  68  17   0  47  46  80  29
4  39  35  81  14  24  31  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to distribute all 7 items such that agents receive items they value highly, and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations strategically:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 highest (85), followed by item 4 (84). These items are highly valued compared to other agents, so Agent 0 should receive item 2.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 highest (97). This valuation is the highest among all valuations, so Agent 1 should receive item 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 and item 5 both at 60, which is relatively high compared to others' valuations. We can assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 highest (80), a significant valuation, so Agent 3 should receive item 5.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 highest (82), so Agent 4 should receive item 6.

After these allocations, items 3 and 4 are still unallocated. Let's assign them based on the remaining valuations:

- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 77, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 has a relatively high valuation of 46, and it balances the number of items among agents. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

Now, let's format the allocations as specified:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and all 7 items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations.
