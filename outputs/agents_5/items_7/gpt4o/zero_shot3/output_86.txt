Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  33  39   6  45  53  42
1   1   3  26  88  84   5  38
2  27  74  45  78  11  13  43
3   2  25  66   0  98   1  10
4  78  30  13  51  78  23  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Since there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others. One approach is to assign each agent an item they value highly and then distribute the remaining items considering the leftover preferences and to balance the total number of items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are [56, 33, 39, 6, 45, 53, 42]
   - Assign Item 0 (Value 56) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are [1, 3, 26, 88, 84, 5, 38]
   - Assign Item 3 (Value 88) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are [27, 74, 45, 78, 11, 13, 43]
   - Assign Item 1 (Value 74) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are [2, 25, 66, 0, 98, 1, 10]
   - Assign Item 4 (Value 98) to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are [78, 30, 13, 51, 78, 23, 48]
   - Assign Item 6 (Value 48) to Agent 4.

Now, distribute the remaining items (2, 5):

- Assign Item 2 (Value 39) to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign Item 5 (Value 23) to Agent 4 (next best value for Agent 4).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with two agents receiving an additional item, and the overall valuation is relatively balanced according to their preferences.
