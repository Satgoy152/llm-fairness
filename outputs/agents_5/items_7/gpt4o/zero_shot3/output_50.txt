Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  43  28  28  93  62  30
1  77  71  99   7  18  84  33
2  98  31  39  92  52  89  38
3  36  80  44  62  91  46   0
4  99  21  14  66  12  82  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed. Since there are 7 items and 5 agents, not every agent will receive the same number of items. We will distribute the items based on the valuation each agent has for them, attempting to maximize the overall satisfaction across all agents.

Let's break down a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for an item and attempt to allocate that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure that each item is only assigned to one agent, and each agent has a reasonable distribution of items.

Based on the values provided, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (93), so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (99), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (98), so allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (80), so allocate item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (65), so allocate item 6 to agent 4.
- Allocate the remaining items (3 and 5) to agents based on their next highest preferences:
  - Agent 3 also values item 3 (62), allocate item 3 to agent 3.
  - Agent 1 values item 5 (84), allocate item 5 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their preferences, and all items are distributed. Below is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation meets the criteria of fairly distributing all 7 items among the 5 agents.
