Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  13  46  27  53  66  47
1  94  82   8  61  39  76  46
2  95  83  45  16  11   0  60
3  50  78  19  23  13  98  62
4  73  89  55  70  93  97  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 13 46 27 53 66 47]
 [94 82  8 61 39 76 46]
 [95 83 45 16 11  0 60]
 [50 78 19 23 13 98 62]
 [73 89 55 70 93 97 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value based on their preferences. We can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Start by sorting the valuations for each item from the highest to lowest across all agents.
2. Assign items to agents in such a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 2 (valuation: 95)
- Item 1: Assign to Agent 4 (valuation: 89)
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 0 (valuation: 46)
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 1 (valuation: 61)
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 4 (valuation: 93)
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 3 (valuation: 98)
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 2 (valuation: 60)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

Each agent has received their allocated items, and all items are distributed.
