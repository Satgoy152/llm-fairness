Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  32  73   9  23  95  71
1  85   5  83  96  48  72  51
2   1  10  77  22  63  55  78
3  93  52  43  15  29  19  83
4  90  56  78  17  95  46  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
Allocating items fairly among agents involves maximizing the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item across all agents**: This ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most. 

2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuations**:
   - Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 93.
   - Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most at 56.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 73.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 96.
   - Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 78.

3. **Assign the items based on these valuations**:
   - Agent 0: Items 2, 5
   - Agent 1: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Item 6
   - Agent 3: Item 0
   - Agent 4: Items 1, 4

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
