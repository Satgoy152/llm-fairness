Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  66  47  41  50  29  98
1  98  41  93  54  18  59  26
2   4  94  10  84  96  75  92
3  42  18  77   9  48  54  78
4  59   7  44  12  75  84  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering the values each agent places on the items. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, let's proceed with the allocation.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign the item they value most that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, assign them the most valued unallocated item.
3. Continue with this strategy for the remaining agents, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Based on this approach, here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 6 (values 96 and 98)
- **Agent 1**: Items 2 and 0 (value 93, but item 0 already taken, so next best)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value 96)
- **Agent 3**: Item 5 (value 54)
- **Agent 4**: Item 3 (value 12)

Now, let's re-check to ensure no item is allocated twice and each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [1] (Agent 4 can have item 1 as it has the next highest value for Agent 4)

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
