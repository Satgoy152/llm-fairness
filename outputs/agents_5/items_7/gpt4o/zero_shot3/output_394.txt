Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  59  70  78  84  59  66
1  15  67  56  27  92  79  42
2  54   7  45  63  18  64  86
3  91   0  94  85   5  33  78
4  63  49  80  86  40   5  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One possible approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 1: Agent 1 values it at 92, the highest among all.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 4: Agent 4 values it at 86, the highest among all.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3: Agent 3 values it at 94, the highest among all.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 3: Agent 3 values it at 91, the highest among all.
5. Assign item 6 to agent 2: Agent 2 values it at 86, the highest among all.
6. Assign item 1 to agent 0: Agent 0 values it at 59, matching agent 1, but agent 1 already has item 4.
7. Assign item 5 to agent 1: Agent 1 values it at 79, the highest remaining valuation.

Now, let's format this allocation into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.
