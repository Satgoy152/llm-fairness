Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  97  25   1   9  91  35
1   0  79  44  72  16  30  20
2  35  38  64  58  26   3  59
3  20  53  74  47  36  21  62
4  41  37  50  26  11  87  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated in total. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent** to give them a fair opportunity to maximize their total valuation.

2. **Allocate items to agents** by ensuring each item goes to the agent who values it the most, while taking care that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

3. **Adjust allocations** if any agent has too many items or if any are left unallocated, ensuring a fair distribution.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the highest with 41.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest with 97.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the highest with 74.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the highest with 72.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the highest with 36.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest with 91.
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the highest with 68.

After the above allocations, Agent 2 has no items, so we need to adjust to give Agent 2 an item:

- Reallocate Item 4 from Agent 3 to Agent 2, since Agent 2 values it reasonably (26) and Agent 3 still has more items.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent has at least one item, except for Agent 2 who gets one item after reallocation.
