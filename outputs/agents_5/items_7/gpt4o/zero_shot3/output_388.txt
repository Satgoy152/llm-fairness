Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  92  20  95  65  31  52
1  55   1  27  44  70  22  50
2  60  46  44   2  29  27  42
3  69  36  64  88  82  39   9
4  63  83  24  37  93  73  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 92 20 95 65 31 52]
 [55  1 27 44 70 22 50]
 [60 46 44  2 29 27 42]
 [69 36 64 88 82 39  9]
 [63 83 24 37 93 73 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all 7 items are allocated exactly once. 

We can approach this problem by trying to maximize the individual satisfaction of each agent, which is represented by their valuation of the items. We need to ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [53, 92, 20, 95, 65, 31, 52]
Agent 1: [55,  1, 27, 44, 70, 22, 50]
Agent 2: [60, 46, 44,  2, 29, 27, 42]
Agent 3: [69, 36, 64, 88, 82, 39,  9]
Agent 4: [63, 83, 24, 37, 93, 73, 91]
```

We'll allocate the items based on the highest values each agent assigns to them, ensuring that each item is allocated exactly once.

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (69)
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (92)
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (64), but Agent 4 gets it since Agent 3 is getting other preferred items.
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (95)
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (93)
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (73)
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (91)

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Items 2, 4, 5, 6

JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated once, and we have maximized the satisfaction of each agent based on their preferences.
