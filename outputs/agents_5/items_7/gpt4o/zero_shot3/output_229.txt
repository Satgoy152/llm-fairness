Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  28  69  46  99  59  52
1  89  80  26  81  72   6  70
2  11  56  87  55  15  18  50
3   8  70  93  21  66  74  88
4  51  68  95  31   5  16  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [11 56 87 55 15 18 50]
 [ 8 70 93 21 66 74 88]
 [51 68 95 31  5 16 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.

We will use a heuristic approach to allocate items to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation item is 4 (99), so allocate item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Next highest valuation item is 0 (89), so allocate item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Next highest valuation item is 2 (87), so allocate item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Next highest valuation item is 6 (88), so allocate item 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Next highest valuation item is 2 (95), but since item 2 is taken, allocate next highest available, which is item 6 (95).

Now, we have allocated items 0, 2, 4, and 6. We still need to allocate items 1, 3, 5:

6. **Item 1**: Highest remaining valuation for item 1 is agent 3 (70), so allocate item 1 to agent 3.
7. **Item 3**: Highest remaining valuation for item 3 is agent 1 (81), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
8. **Item 5**: Highest remaining valuation for item 5 is agent 3 (74), so allocate item 5 to agent 3.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 5, 6],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent.
