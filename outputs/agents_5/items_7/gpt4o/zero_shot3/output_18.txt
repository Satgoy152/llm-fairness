Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  80  43  99  50  81  96
1  71  47  64  34   7   9  50
2  54  66  90  91  91  64  53
3  52  47  76  16  99  10  66
4  22  88  64  47   7  91  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while taking into consideration their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent. However, since the goal is to ensure fairness and everyone must get at least one item, we can also consider the approach where each agent gets at least one item from their top preferences. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given table:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 (71).
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 2 (90).
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 4 (99).
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for item 5 (91).

Now, each agent has received one item. We have allocated 5 items so far, leaving us with items 1 and 6 to allocate.

To allocate the remaining items:

6. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest valuation from unallocated items is by Agent 4 (88).
   
7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest valuation from unallocated items is by Agent 0 (96).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.
