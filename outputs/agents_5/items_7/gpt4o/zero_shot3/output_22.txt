Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  32  93  77  59  27   2
1  22  18  50  88  59  23   6
2   7   0  85  66  54  59  54
3  25  44  29  24  25  47  82
4  15  80  29  56  16  79  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 32 93 77 59 27  2]
 [22 18 50 88 59 23  6]
 [ 7  0 85 66 54 59 54]
 [25 44 29 24 25 47 82]
 [15 80 29 56 16 79 45]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (since there are 7 items and 5 agents, at least 2 agents will receive 2 items). A common method to achieve such an allocation is to use a greedy approach focusing on maximizing individual valuations.

Let's go through the valuation table and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 2 (93). Assign item 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 3 (88). Assign item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 2 (85), but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 5 (59). Assign item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 6 (82). Assign item 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is item 1 (80). Assign item 1.

Now each agent has at least one item. We have used 5 items and have 2 items remaining (0 and 4).

We now distribute the remaining items to maximize the valuation of the agents receiving them:

- **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 0 (67). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 4 (59). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

This way, each agent will have at least one item and the total value is maximized based on the given constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item while maximizing their individual valuations.
