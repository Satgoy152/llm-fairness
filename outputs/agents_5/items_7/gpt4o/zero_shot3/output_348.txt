Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  64   3  95  86  70  44
1  56  14  32  78   7  45  55
2  96  90  61  24  12  52  49
3  46  53  19  44  58  83  52
4  85   1  67  91  20  43   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that each agent receives at least one item. We aim for a fair distribution based on their preferences while ensuring that every item is allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (96). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (78). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 and item 1 equally (96 and 90). Since item 0 is already assigned, assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (83). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (91). Since item 3 is already assigned, assign item 2 to Agent 4 (67).

After allocating based on the highest value for each agent, we still have items 4 and 6 remaining. Let's consider the next highest valuations for these items:

6. Agent 0 values item 4 the second highest (86). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
7. Agent 1 values item 6 the second highest (55). Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.
