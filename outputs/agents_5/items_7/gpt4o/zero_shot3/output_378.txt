Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  84   9   3  64  20  52
1  21  94  71  97  33  90  51
2  70  41  70  12  77  70  55
3  31  53  96  13  71  80  86
4  34  38  36  62  21  73   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one potential allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0:** Highly values item 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 1:** Highly values item 3.
3. **Agent 2:** Values are quite balanced, with a preference for item 4.
4. **Agent 3:** Highly values item 2 and item 6.
5. **Agent 4:** Has generally low values, but item 5 is relatively higher.

Considering these preferences, here is one way to allocate the items:

- Assign items 0 and 1 to agent 0. 
- Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Assign items 2 and 6 to agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```
