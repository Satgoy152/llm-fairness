Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  51  43  50  85  33  18
1  84  34  62  80  67  88  59
2  88  23  30  36  68  43  63
3   0   1  87  40  10  66  71
4  47  60  84  49  36  17  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. A common approach is to use a variation of the "maximum sum allocation" problem. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for any item.
2. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each item is allocated only once.

Let's consider the following allocation process:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 85).
- Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 88).
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value 88).
- Agent 3 gets item 2 (value 87).
- Agent 4 gets item 1 (value 60).

Now, we have two remaining items (3 and 6) and need to allocate them so that each agent gets at least one item:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 80).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 18).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed based on their valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
