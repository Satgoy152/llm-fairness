Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  69  63  43  82  85  40
1  31  74  60  86  69  72  36
2  42   9  59  45  45  66  18
3  97  13  33  64  33  25  44
4  31  98  32  21  81  76  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider both the valuations and the need to ensure each agent has an integer number of items, with a total of exactly 7 items allotted among all agents.

Let's analyze the valuations and create a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 0, 5, and 4.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 3, 1, and 5.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 5 and 2.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 0, 3, and 6.
   - Since item 0 and 3 have been allocated, allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 1, 5, and 4.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

At this point, items 2 and 4 are left unallocated and agents 0, 2, and 3 have only one item each. We need to ensure all items are allocated:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (as they have a relatively high valuation for it).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (as they have a good valuation for it).

Now, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and reflects a reasonable distribution based on the agents' valuations.
