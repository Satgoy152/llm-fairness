Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25   0  77  72  73  38  73
1  61  73  69  82  76  99  53
2   9  92  94  90  66  31  25
3  87  17  66   7  40  46  66
4  66  74  82  38  69  87  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated. This involves some degree of balancing between the highest valuations and spreading the items fairly among agents.

Below is one possible fair allocation, where we try to ensure that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly:

1. Agent 0 gets item 2 (value of 77) and item 3 (value of 72).
2. Agent 1 gets item 1 (value of 73) and item 5 (value of 99).
3. Agent 2 gets item 4 (value of 66).
4. Agent 3 gets item 0 (value of 87).
5. Agent 4 gets item 6 (value of 29).

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets a selection of items that are relatively valuable to them while ensuring all items are distributed.
