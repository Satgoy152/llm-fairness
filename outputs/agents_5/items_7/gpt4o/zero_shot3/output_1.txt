Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35   2  94   0  59   0  76
1  45  36  42  89  32  16  76
2   6  89  66  15  13  26  51
3  28  63  35  38  86  74  28
4  12  72  55  84  65  82  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated. A reasonable approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has for unallocated items, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Item 0:**  
   - Agent 0 values this at 35, the highest among all agents.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**  
   - Agent 2 values this at 89, the highest among all agents.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

3. **Item 2:**  
   - Agent 0 values this at 94, the highest among all agents.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**  
   - Agent 1 values this at 89, the highest among all agents.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**  
   - Agent 3 values this at 86, the highest among all agents.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

6. **Item 5:**  
   - Agent 4 values this at 82, the highest among all agents.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

7. **Item 6:**  
   - Agent 0 values this at 76, the highest among all agents.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent receives an integer number of items.
