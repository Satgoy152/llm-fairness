Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  43  66  63  36  46  15
1  41  80  97  88  75  27  63
2  36  65  32   3  18   6  43
3  82  70  55  90  77  23  36
4  35  55   5  40   2  39  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy or heuristic method to assign the items based on the highest valuation. Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Agent 3** values Item 3 the most at 90.
2. **Agent 1** values Item 2 the most at 97.
3. **Agent 1** values Item 1 the second most at 80.
4. **Agent 3** values Item 0 the second most at 82.
5. **Agent 3** values Item 4 the third most at 77.
6. **Agent 1** values Item 4 the third most at 75.
7. **Agent 1** values Item 6 the fourth most at 63.

After considering the valuations, we must ensure that every item is allocated and that each agent receives a fair share of the total value. We can adjust the allocations slightly to balance out the allocations:

- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 4.

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed among the agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 3, 4],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 7 items being allocated.
