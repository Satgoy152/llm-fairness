Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3   5  68  81  33  10  88
1  56  59  87   1  59   1  76
2  95  45  97  51  75  12   7
3  69  62  14  52  27  82   1
4  15  40  92  70  67  51  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This is a challenging problem, often approached using algorithms for fair division or optimization problems. Here, we'll use a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items:

1. **Assign the highest valued item first:** For each item, determine which agent values it the most and assign it to that agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. 

2. **Ensure a fair distribution of items:** Since there are 7 items and 5 agents, not everyone will get the same number of items. We will try to allocate so that the distribution of items is as even as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2 (95), assign it to Agent 2.
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 3 (62), assign it to Agent 3.
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 2 (97), assign it to Agent 2.
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 0 (81), assign it to Agent 0.
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 2 (75), but since Agent 2 already has two items, assign it to Agent 1 (59).
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 3 (82), but since Agent 3 already has one item, assign it to Agent 4 (51).
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 0 (88), but since Agent 0 already has one item, assign it to Agent 1 (76).

Now, let's ensure that each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 5

Let's format this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
