Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  97  69  50  64  20  27
1  96  37  63  54  30  88  43
2   9  97  14  51  46  51  59
3  29  78  12  48  35  66  20
4   1  71  91  68  74  39  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible approach:

1. Assign the highest valued item to each agent in a round-robin fashion or based on their highest preference, ensuring each gets one item first.
2. Distribute any remaining items by considering the next highest values for each agent.

Given the valuations, let's distribute the items:

- Agent 0: Highest value is for item 1, valued at 97.
- Agent 1: Highest value is for item 0, valued at 96.
- Agent 2: Highest value is for item 1, valued at 97, but since item 1 is already allocated, we consider the next highest, which is item 6, valued at 59.
- Agent 3: Highest value is for item 1, valued at 78, but since item 1 is already allocated, we consider the next highest, which is item 5, valued at 66.
- Agent 4: Highest value is for item 2, valued at 91.

Now, let's look at the items allocated so far:
- Items 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6 are allocated, leaving items 3 and 4 unallocated.

Let's allocate the remaining items 3 and 4 by maximizing the value for agents with the least total value so far.

- For item 3, Agent 4 has the highest unallocated value, which is 68.
- For item 4, Agent 0 has a reasonable value of 64.

The final allocation based on the above steps is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated while considering the agents' valuations as closely as possible.
