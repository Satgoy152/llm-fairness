Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  16  12  39  78  76  73
1  60  23  52  17  90  76  18
2  95  27   6  56  82  78  92
3  59  94   0   0  93  96  35
4  89  88  75   5  50   4  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will use a method that considers the valuations each agent has for the items. An optimal allocation should attempt to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no more than the available items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [49, 16, 12, 39, 78, 76, 73]
Agent 1: [60, 23, 52, 17, 90, 76, 18]
Agent 2: [95, 27, 6, 56, 82, 78, 92]
Agent 3: [59, 94, 0, 0, 93, 96, 35]
Agent 4: [89, 88, 75, 5, 50, 4, 83]
```

The goal is to allocate these items to maximize the fairness and total value across all agents. Let's prioritize items based on highest individual valuation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 (95)
2. Item 1: Agent 3 (94)
3. Item 2: Agent 4 (75)
4. Item 3: Agent 2 (56)
5. Item 4: Agent 1 (90)
6. Item 5: Agent 3 (96)
7. Item 6: Agent 2 (92)

Assign the items to the agents:

- Agent 2 gets items 0, 3, 6
- Agent 3 gets items 1, 5
- Agent 4 gets item 2
- Agent 1 gets item 4
- Agent 0 gets no items

This allocation attempts to ensure that the highest value items are given to the agents who value them the most, while distributing the items fairly across agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3, 6],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [2]
}
```
