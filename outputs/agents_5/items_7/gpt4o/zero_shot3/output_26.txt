Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  18  42  39  45  69  42
1  58  42  11  66  83  66   0
2  34  55  45  77  16   4  25
3  52  53  26  47   1  61  48
4  87  63  26  57  81  37  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and distribute the items to maximize overall satisfaction. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate the items based on the highest individual valuations. Here's one way to do it:

1. Compile a list of all items with their respective valuations by each agent.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on the valuations.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the highest, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible and only an integer number of items.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. Compile a list of items with valuations:

    - Item 0: [14, 58, 34, 52, 87]
    - Item 1: [18, 42, 55, 53, 63]
    - Item 2: [42, 11, 45, 26, 26]
    - Item 3: [39, 66, 77, 47, 57]
    - Item 4: [45, 83, 16, 1, 81]
    - Item 5: [69, 66, 4, 61, 37]
    - Item 6: [42, 0, 25, 48, 98]

2. Create a list of tuples (value, agent, item):

    - (87, 4, 0), (63, 4, 1), (81, 4, 4), (98, 4, 6)
    - (58, 1, 0), (42, 1, 1), (66, 1, 3), (83, 1, 4), (66, 1, 5)
    - (34, 2, 0), (55, 2, 1), (45, 2, 2), (77, 2, 3), (16, 2, 4), (4, 2, 5), (25, 2, 6)
    - (52, 3, 0), (53, 3, 1), (26, 3, 2), (47, 3, 3), (1, 3, 4), (61, 3, 5), (48, 3, 6)
    - (14, 0, 0), (18, 0, 1), (42, 0, 2), (39, 0, 3), (45, 0, 4), (69, 0, 5), (42, 0, 6)

3. Sort this list in descending order:

    - (98, 4, 6), (87, 4, 0), (83, 1, 4), (81, 4, 4), (77, 2, 3), (69, 0, 5), (66, 1, 3), (66, 1, 5), (63, 4, 1), (61, 3, 5), (58, 1, 0), (55, 2, 1), (53, 3, 1), (52, 3, 0), (48, 3, 6), (47, 3, 3), (45, 2, 2), (45, 0, 4), (42, 1, 1), (42, 0, 2), (42, 0, 6), (39, 0, 3), (37, 4, 5), (34, 2, 0), (26, 3, 2), (26, 4, 2), (25, 2, 6), (18, 0, 1), (16, 2, 4), (14, 0, 0), (11, 1, 2), (4, 2, 5), (1, 3, 4), (0, 1, 6)

4. Allocate items:

    - Item 6 to agent 4
    - Item 0 to agent 4
    - Item 4 to agent 1
    - Item 3 to agent 2
    - Item 5 to agent 0
    - Item 1 to agent 2
    - Item 2 to agent 0

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6, 0]
}
```
