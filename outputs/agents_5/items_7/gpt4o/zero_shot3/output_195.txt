Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  94  11  87  39  10  65
1  38  10  48  39   8  65  29
2  55  36  62  50  58  23  59
3   8  87  78  49  51  53  75
4  82  57  58  14  44   3  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. Here is one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 very highly (94), so we assign item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Next, item 3 is also valued highly by Agent 0 (87), so we assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 5 highly (65), so we assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Next, Agent 1 values item 2 at 48, so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 4 (58) and item 6 (59) similarly, but item 6 is valued higher than by other agents, so we assign item 6 to Agent 2.
   - Then, we assign item 4 to Agent 2 as well.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Agent 3 values item 0 (82) the highest among all agents, so we assign item 0 to Agent 4.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Agent 4 values the remaining item 0 (82) the highest, but since item 0 is already allocated, Agent 4 does not receive any items.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
