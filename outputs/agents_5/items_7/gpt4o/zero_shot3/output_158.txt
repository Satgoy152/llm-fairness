Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  15  10   3  59  57  32
1  62  45  23  76  87  68  58
2  74  42  69  72   1   9  52
3  54  39  76  57   9  92  56
4  24  21  77  24  25  24  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Allocate Items to Agents Who Value Them Most:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the highest.

3. **Ensure Each Agent Receives at Least One Item:**
   - If any agent ends up with no items, consider reallocating an item with relatively lower valuation to ensure that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's go through each step:

- **Item 0:** Agent 2 values it the highest at 74.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it the highest at 15.
- **Item 2:** Agent 4 values it the highest at 77.
- **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 76.
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 87.
- **Item 5:** Agent 3 values it the highest at 92.
- **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 58.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 has item 1.
- Agent 1 has items 3, 4, and 6.
- Agent 2 has item 0.
- Agent 3 has item 5.
- Agent 4 has item 2.

Each agent now has at least one item. The allocation is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```
