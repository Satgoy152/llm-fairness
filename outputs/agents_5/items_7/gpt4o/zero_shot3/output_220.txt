Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  33  29  18  37  92  77
1  33  95  87  58  97  25  93
2  53   0  86  45  28  26  16
3   8  86  45  32  74  19   4
4  92  81  98  11  17  25  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items they value highly while keeping the allocation equitable. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Assign high-value items**: Start by assigning items to agents who value them the most.
2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item**: If possible, ensure each agent receives at least one item to maintain fairness.
3. **Balance the allocation**: Distribute the remaining items to balance total valuations across agents as much as possible.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most (value 92). Assign to Agent 4.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most (value 95). Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it the most (value 98). Assign to Agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most (value 58). Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (value 97). Assign to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most (value 92). Assign to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most (value 93). Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's format the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3, 4, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and agents receive items they value highly, as much as possible within the constraints.
