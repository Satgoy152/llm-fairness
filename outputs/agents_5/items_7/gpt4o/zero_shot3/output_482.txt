Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  69  57  55  86  24  26
1  32  48   5  68  35  26  29
2   3   9  99  36  56  11  11
3  66  30  82  71  40  40  64
4  17  92  27   4  85  70  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. This approach balances fairness and efficiency.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (86), Item 1 (69)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (68)
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (99)
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (66), Item 6 (64)
   
5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (70)

Now, let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations while ensuring fairness:

- Agent 0 gets Items 1 and 4
- Agent 1 gets Item 3
- Agent 2 gets Item 2
- Agent 3 gets Items 0 and 6
- Agent 4 gets Item 5

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent's preferences are considered. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```
