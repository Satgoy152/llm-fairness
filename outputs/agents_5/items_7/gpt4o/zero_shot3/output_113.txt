Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  28  32   4  58  58   1
1   7  79  24  51  77  75  58
2   0  18  35  62  16  82  31
3  12  62  58  52  36  50  24
4  36  44  46  24  48  49  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 28 32  4 58 58  1]
 [ 7 79 24 51 77 75 58]
 [ 0 18 35 62 16 82 31]
 [12 62 58 52 36 50 24]
 [36 44 46 24 48 49 92]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent. Below is a possible allocation that respects these constraints:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0, as it has the highest valuation for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items 1, 4, and 5, as these have relatively high valuations for agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 3, as it has the highest valuation for agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 2, as it has a relatively high valuation for agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 6, as it has the highest valuation for agent 4.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6]
}
```
