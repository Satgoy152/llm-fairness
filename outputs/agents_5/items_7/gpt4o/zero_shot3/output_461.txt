Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  98  70  16   2  26   8
1  15  27  12  47  25  79  89
2  64  86  49  41  49  39  70
3  69  99  53  17  75  35   4
4  26  88  55  86  71  76  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while considering the valuations provided by each agent, a common approach is to maximize the total valuations each agent receives. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Preferences**: First, identify the highest value each agent has for any item and allocate that item to the agent if it's not already taken. This ensures each agent gets their most valued item if possible.

2. **Iterate Through Agents**: Continue the process of allocating the next highest value item to agents, ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent.

3. **Balance the Allocation**: Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Here's a fair allocation based on the preferences and valuations given:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 1, so allocate item 1.
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 6, so allocate item 6.
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 1, but it's taken, next highest (86) is for item 0, so allocate item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 1, but it's taken, next highest (99) is for item 3, so allocate item 3.
- **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 1, but it's taken, next highest (88) is for item 4, so allocate item 4.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items. 

- Remaining items: 2, 5.
- **Agent 0** is next highest for item 2 (70), so allocate item 2.
- **Agent 4** is highest for item 5 (76), so allocate item 5.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.
