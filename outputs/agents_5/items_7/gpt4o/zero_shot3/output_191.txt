Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  58  66  68  19  51  17
1  87  28  58  43  58  70  77
2  50  75   0  47  34  49  99
3  32  71  60  29  34  88  51
4  34  17  81  40   4  53  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple strategy to try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for the items and allocate those items first.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated in such a way that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Try to maximize the overall satisfaction by ensuring the highest possible total valuation for each agent.

Let's see how this can be done:

- Agent 0: The highest values are for items 3 and 2.
- Agent 1: The highest values are for items 0 and 6.
- Agent 2: The highest values are for items 6 and 1.
- Agent 3: The highest values are for items 5 and 1.
- Agent 4: The highest values are for items 2 and 5.

The challenge is to distribute these items in such a way that we do not allocate any item more than once.

A possible allocation could be:
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4, as it is the highest value for them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 as it is their second highest value.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as it is their remaining highest value, considering other items are already allocated.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and each agent receives a reasonable allocation based on their valuations.
