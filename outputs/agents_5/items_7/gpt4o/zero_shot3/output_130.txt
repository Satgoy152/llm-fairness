Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  36  47  75   9  65  96
1  32  39  76  60  97  57  21
2  91  18   5  28  84   3   7
3  78  99  11  54  16  51  54
4   9  23  40  48  74  23  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that the allocation appears fair based on the given valuations. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 6.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3.

For the remaining items (2 and 5), we should allocate them to agents who haven't received any items yet or to balance the allocations:
- Item 5 can be allocated to Agent 0, who has a high valuation for it.
- Item 2 can be allocated to Agent 1, who also has a relatively high valuation for it.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
