Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  88  26  76  37  73   1
1  16  60   9   6   7  68  90
2  78  45  30   5  34  34  87
3  29  48  14  63  17  69  45
4  44   9  75  16   8  30  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. We will ensure that every item is assigned to one and only one agent, and each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze the table and make an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 1 (value 88) and item 0 (value 74).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 6 (value 90) and item 5 (value 68).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 0 (value 78) and item 6 (value 87).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 5 (value 69) and item 3 (value 63).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 2 (value 75) and item 6 (value 60).

Given these preferences, a potential allocation could be:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as it's their highest value.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it's their highest value.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it's their highest value.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it's among their higher values and less contested.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4, as it's their highest value.

Now, distribute the remaining items 4 and 5:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as they value it highly.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it balances their allocations.

This allocation considers preferences and ensures all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item while respecting the total number of items.
