Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  50  40  75  34  76  26
1  35  80  84  77  19  77  37
2  81   2  98  60  75  37  68
3  31  68   1  39  33  54  87
4  98  31  67  24  30  98  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to use an iterative method, where we assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most, provided that no agent receives more than the fair share of items, which is one item per agent in this case, since there are 5 agents and 7 items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it the most at 98. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the most at 80. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 2 values it the most at 98. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it the most at 77, but since they already have one item, we consider the next highest, which is Agent 0 at 75. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it the most at 75, but since they already have one item, we consider the next highest, which is Agent 0 at 34. Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 4 values it the most at 98. Assign Item 5 to Agent 4.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 3 values it the most at 87. Assign Item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 5 agents fairly, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
