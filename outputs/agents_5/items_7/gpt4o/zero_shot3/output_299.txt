Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  86  82  24  75  85   7
1   2  55  93  39  77  32  82
2  12   0  85  56   2  22  31
3  45  11  59  15  35  43  73
4  73  60  24  49  22  18  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items so that each agent's total value is relatively balanced. We aim to ensure that all items are distributed and no agent is left out.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest value for each item and allocating it to the corresponding agent.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
3. Reassign items if necessary to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here is a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (86) and item 5 (85).
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly (93).
- Agent 2 values item 3 (56).
- Agent 3 values item 6 (73).
- Agent 4 values item 0 (73).

Given this information, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 5]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [0, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
