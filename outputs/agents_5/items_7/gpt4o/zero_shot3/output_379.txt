Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  31  98   1  51  80  23
1  86  19  49  71  72  58  51
2  94  30  61  28  57  21  53
3  24  74  20  71  98  49  58
4  33   2  32  84  30  69  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent receives a reasonable share of their preferred items. The goal is to distribute all 7 items among the 5 agents while ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

Let's look at the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (98) and 5 (80).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (86) and 4 (72).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (94) and 2 (61).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (98) and 1 (74).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (84) and 5 (69).

Considering these valuations, let's assign items to agents:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (98) and Item 5 (80)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (86)
- **Agent 2**: Item 6 (53)
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (98) and Item 1 (74)
- **Agent 4**: Item 3 (84)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item. The allocation is done in a way that attempts to maximize total valuation for each agent based on their highest preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
