Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  53  36  65  82  28  96
1  67  10   9   3  54  61  81
2  13  66  55  81  49  60  89
3  61  46   5  33   8  24   3
4  52  37  70   9  19  62   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute all 7 items among the 5 agents based on their valuations.

Here is one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Values the items highly, especially item 6. Assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a decent valuation for item 5. Assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 highly. Assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Can be given item 0, which has a reasonable valuation for them.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 highly. Assign item 2 to agent 4.

Now, we have assigned 5 out of the 7 items. Let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Also has high valuation for items 4 and 1. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 1 to agent 4 due to a relatively higher valuation than others.

This distribution ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations and that all 7 items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, maximizing the overall satisfaction.
