Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  99  80  89   6   4  90
1  78  40   6  70  72   9  21
2  74  44  49  36  84  81  11
3   1  48  14  81  13  47  11
4  54  10  99  15  66  25  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim for an allocation that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll use a simple approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:** Look for items where an agent has a significantly higher valuation compared to others. This can help ensure the agent is getting items they value highly.

2. **Distribute items evenly:** Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible. Since there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

3. **Adjust for fairness:** Ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible by considering the total valuation each agent has for their allocated items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Highly values item 1 and item 6. Assign these items to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 0 highly. Assign this item to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 4 highly. Assign this item to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 3 highly. Assign this item to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 2 highly. Assign this item to Agent 4.

Now, all items are allocated. We need to ensure that each agent's allocation is fair by considering their total valuation for their assigned items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation assigns each agent at least one item and ensures that the total number of items allocated is 7. It also tries to give each agent items that they value highly, within the given constraints.
