Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  12  91  73  37  58  65
1  31  57  60  86  72  23   1
2  33   7  66   6  70  49  26
3  63  60  90   8  86  24   7
4  42  69   6  61   5  45   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on the given valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, given there are 5 agents and 7 items. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 5. We can allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3, 4, and 1. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4 and 5. We can allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 2 and 0. We can allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 1 and 0. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and need to allocate 2 more to ensure a total of 7 items are allocated. Let's distribute the remaining items based on the remaining high preferences:

6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for it compared to other unallocated agents.
7. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3, who has a decent valuation for it.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
