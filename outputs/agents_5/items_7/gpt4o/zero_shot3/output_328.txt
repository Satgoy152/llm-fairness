Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  18  88  67  79  55  61
1  45  12  34  87  87  12  83
2  45  55  67  26  22  56  73
3  31  75   1  13  52  32  25
4  50  16  44  36  12  61  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to balance the total valuations each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible, based on their individual valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items:

   - Agent 0: 11 + 18 + 88 + 67 + 79 + 55 + 61 = 379
   - Agent 1: 45 + 12 + 34 + 87 + 87 + 12 + 83 = 360
   - Agent 2: 45 + 55 + 67 + 26 + 22 + 56 + 73 = 344
   - Agent 3: 31 + 75 + 1 + 13 + 52 + 32 + 25 = 229
   - Agent 4: 50 + 16 + 44 + 36 + 12 + 61 + 51 = 270

2. Allocate items to agents by selecting the item that each agent values the most, ensuring that each item is assigned only once. If there's a tie, consider the next highest valuation or distribute based on remaining items and agents.

3. Iterate through this process until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on the values:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (88).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (87).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (73).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (75).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest (61).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (0, 4):

- Agent 0 values item 4 more than others (79).
- Agent 3 values item 0 more than others (31).

All items are now allocated, and each agent has received the items they value most highly without any overlaps:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 0],
    "4": [5]
}
```
