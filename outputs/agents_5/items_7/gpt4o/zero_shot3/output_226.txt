Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  38  33  88  24  84   1
1  93  28  71  12   1  19  32
2  30  65  11  83  19  91  74
3  34  19  86  10  54  96  44
4  55   1  21   3  63   7  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we will aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. This method will ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Let's analyze the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 3 and 5. We can assign item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has high valuation for item 0. We assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 5 and 6. We assign item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 the most. We assign item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 6 the most. We assign item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, we have assigned 5 items in total. Next, we need to consider the remaining items 1 and 4. We should distribute these items to balance the number of items each agent receives, while also considering their valuations.

- **Assign remaining items**:
  - For item 1, Agent 0 values it the most after item 3, but they already have item 3. Agent 2 values item 1 quite high, so we assign item 1 to Agent 2.
  - For item 4, Agent 4 has the next highest valuation after item 6, so we assign item 4 to Agent 4.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
