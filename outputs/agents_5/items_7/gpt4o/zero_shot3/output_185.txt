Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  69  88  45  47  16  23
1  98  64  81   7  48  88  84
2  46  92  10  50  73  45  34
3  62   6  36  48  72  77   6
4  49  34  72  59  20  84  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the agents' valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the most (value of 88).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the most (value of 98).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 the most (value of 92).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the most (value of 77).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 the most (value of 84) but has a unique high value on item 3 (value of 59).

With this consideration, we try to allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 (since item 5 is the next best for Agent 3 after item 3 is considered for Agent 4).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
  
Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (4 and 6):

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (second highest value after items 0 and 2).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (third highest value after items 0 and 4).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
Each agent receives at least one item, all 7 items are allocated, and we attempt to maximize satisfaction based on individual valuations.
