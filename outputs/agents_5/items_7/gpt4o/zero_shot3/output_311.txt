Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  76   6   7   9  37  31
1  10  11  92  52  63  79  34
2  33  39  55  68   2  69  67
3  93   8  56  35  19  47   1
4   8  53  49  26  31  51  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We can use a greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 7 items are allocated in total.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most (93). Assign item 0 to agent 3.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most (76). Assign item 1 to agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most (92). Assign item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most (68). Assign item 3 to agent 2.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most (63). Assign item 4 to agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most (79). Assign item 5 to agent 1.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 4 values it the most (90). Assign item 6 to agent 4.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives item 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 4, and 5.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.
- Agent 3 receives item 0.
- Agent 4 receives item 6.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items is 7.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6]
}
```
