Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  23  88   1  81  67  17
1  28  70  38  30  73  77   6
2  19   4  46  58  92  42  47
3  88  83  74  80  65  89  85
4  24  24   7  35  64  36  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as equitable as possible. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Assign the highest value item for each agent first** to ensure each agent gets at least one high-value item.
2. **Distribute remaining items** by considering which allocations will balance the overall values received by each agent.

Based on the given valuations, let's proceed with the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 2 (88). Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 5 (77). Assign item 5 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 4 (92). Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 (88). Assign item 0 to agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for item 6 (78). Assign item 6 to agent 4.

Now, we still have items 1 and 3 to allocate. Letâ€™s distribute them in a way that balances the overall valuations:

- **Item 1**: Assign to agent 3, as they have a high valuation for it (83), and it will balance their overall allocation.
- **Item 3**: Assign to agent 1, as they have a moderate valuation for it (30), complementing their allocation.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents, with consideration to their valuations.
