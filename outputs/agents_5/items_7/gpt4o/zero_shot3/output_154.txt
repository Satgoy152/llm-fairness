Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  69  62  29  25  93  49
1  28  49  32  37  26  64  99
2  26  82  28  84  31  80  66
3  60  44  88  61  88  99  45
4  14  26  79  84  63  64  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation of each item by each agent. A potential strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item wherever possible to maintain fairness. However, given there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents might end up with more items than others.

Let's consider the valuations and make an allocation:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 76.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 0.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 82.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 88.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 3.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 84.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 88.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 3.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 93.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 0.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 99.
   - Assign item 6 to agent 1.

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation, agent 0 receives items 0 and 5, agent 1 receives item 6, agent 2 receives items 1 and 3, agent 3 receives items 2 and 4, and agent 4 receives no items. This allocation maximizes individual agent valuations given the constraints.
