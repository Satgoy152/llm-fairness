Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  92  70  90  78  58  26
1  62  79  58  26  83  43  13
2  68  14  41  75  81  26  10
3  57  25  94  94  20  19  19
4  85  66   0  17  70  45  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 92 70 90 78 58 26]
 [62 79 58 26 83 43 13]
 [68 14 41 75 81 26 10]
 [57 25 94 94 20 19 19]
 [85 66  0 17 70 45 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum valuation each agent receives. This means each agent should receive at least one item, and we should try to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly, so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly, so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly, so allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 highly, so allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
6. The remaining items 5 and 6 can be allocated to maximize the overall minimum valuation. Let's give item 5 to Agent 0 and item 6 to Agent 4.

This way, each agent gets a fair share, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```
