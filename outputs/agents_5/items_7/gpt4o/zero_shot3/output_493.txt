Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  30  96  89  10  50  74
1  68  61  28   3  61  23  78
2  11  93  54  45  89  26  96
3  78  14  30  72  88  18  75
4   0  27  36  84  11  93  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Given the matrix of valuations, we proceed with a greedy approach to find an allocation with high total value.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 6. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.  
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the most, but item 6 is also highly valued by Agent 3. Instead, assign item 1 to Agent 2, which is the second-highest among unallocated items.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the most. Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 the most. Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 out of 7 items. We need to allocate the remaining items 3 and 4.

6. **Agent 3**, who has a high valuation for item 3, should get item 3.
7. **Agent 4** can take item 4, which is the remaining unallocated item.

Final allocations:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [6, 3]
- Agent 4: [5, 4]

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [5, 4]
}
```
