Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  53  54  41  14  48  85
1  31  27  52  75  69  21  31
2   1  52  89  92   1  10  20
3   4  21  70  77  99  71  46
4  67  52  34  82  59  56  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is 7. We will aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations for a potential allocation:

1. Start by giving each agent one of their highest valued items.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure all items are distributed.

Based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3, but since agent 1 values it highly too, we can give them item 2.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 6.

Let's allocate the remaining items to balance out fairness:

- Agent 0 can get item 5, as they value it relatively well.
- Agent 4 can also take item 1, as they have a decent valuation for it.

Here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Items 1, 6

Now, let's format this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```
