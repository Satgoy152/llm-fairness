Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  51  33  59  67  21  73
1  77  24  48  55  13  25  10
2   3  60  34  19  17  20  28
3  23  47  67   1  58  14  13
4  44  68  63  22  78  14  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider a method that ensures each agent gets at least some value, while also distributing the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 6 (value 73).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 0 (value 77).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 1 (value 60).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 2 (value 67).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 4 (value 78).

After these allocations, items 3 and 5 remain unallocated. Let's allocate them based on the next highest values:

- For item 3, agent 0 values it at 59, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item.
- For item 5, agent 3 values it at 14, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item.

This leads to the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7, fulfilling the conditions of the problem.
