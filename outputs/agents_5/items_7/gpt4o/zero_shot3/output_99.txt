Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  57  27  26  75  56  50
1  34   0  57  44  33  21  61
2  83   6  52  67  95  33  53
3  86  28   9  78  90   3  49
4  99  58  74  64  27  16  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 7 items are distributed among the agents. We should aim to allocate items in a way that reflects the valuations of each agent, ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly, if possible.

Let's consider the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [25, 57, 27, 26, 75, 56, 50]
   - Highest Value: Item 4 (75)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [34, 0, 57, 44, 33, 21, 61]
   - Highest Value: Item 6 (61)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [83, 6, 52, 67, 95, 33, 53]
   - Highest Value: Item 4 (95), but already allocated to Agent 0
   - Next Highest Value: Item 0 (83)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: [86, 28, 9, 78, 90, 3, 49]
   - Highest Value: Item 0 (86), but already allocated to Agent 2
   - Next Highest Value: Item 4 (90), but already allocated to Agent 0
   - Next Highest Value: Item 3 (78)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Values: [99, 58, 74, 64, 27, 16, 37]
   - Highest Value: Item 0 (99), but already allocated to Agent 2
   - Next Highest Value: Item 2 (74)

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- Item 1: Assign to Agent 4, as Agent 4 values it at 58, which is higher than others.
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it at 56, which is higher than others.

After this allocation process, let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items they value relatively highly.
