Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  57  60   1  84  63  39
1  67  33  81  10  90  85  67
2  38  18  89  71  97  51  36
3  74  85  17  97  69  24  37
4   0   2  37  41  61  87  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation, taking into account the valuations of other agents as well. Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations.

Here's a breakdown of the highest value items for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 4 (84), 5 (63), and 2 (60).
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 4 (90), 5 (85), and 2 (81).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 4 (97), 2 (89), and 3 (71).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 3 (97), 1 (85), and 0 (74).
- **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 5 (87), 4 (61), and 3 (41).

To maximize total utility, we'll allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item when possible.

### Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: Item 4 (84) is a high-value item for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 2 (81) is a high-value item for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 5 (51) is a high-value item for Agent 2 after considering the already allocated items.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3 (97) is the highest value item for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Item 5 is already taken, so item 1 (2) is the next choice with lower competition.

6. **Remaining items**: Items 0 and 6 are left. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (second high preference) and item 6 to Agent 0.

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly based on valuations, with each agent receiving at least one item.
