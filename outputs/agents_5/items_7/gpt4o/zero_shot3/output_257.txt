Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  53  79  71   7  11  77
1  68  19  28  95  77  43  89
2  30  38  44   3   6  85  98
3  81  17  93  51  75  25  95
4  21  24  11  58  88  43  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences, while ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent is considered. Below is one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 3 and also values item 6.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 6 and item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values items 2, 0, and 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Has a high valuation for item 4.

Given these preferences, here's one potential allocation of the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 81).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 53).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value 93).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 95).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (value 88).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 85).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 77).

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to one agent and attempts to maximize the total values based on the agents' preferences. Below is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation fairly distributes the items while considering the agents' preferences and ensuring all items are allocated.
