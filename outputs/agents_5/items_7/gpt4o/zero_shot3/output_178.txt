Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  23  37  48  21  21  74
1  47  36  85   5  36   7  76
2   5  95  32  53   0  70  33
3  46  29  11  29  44  63  61
4  44  24  48  15  59  14  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. The goal is to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Begin by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. **Prioritize High Value Items**: Assign items to agents who value them the most, while trying to balance the total valuations among agents.
3. **Distribute Remaining Items**: Ensure all items are allocated by distributing any remaining items to agents without exceeding a reasonable balance in total values.

Following this strategy, the allocation can be as follows:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 0 and 6.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 3 and 4 have more balanced valuations, so they can be allocated the remaining items with consideration to maintain fairness.

Here is a reasonable allocation based on the strategy above:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers the high valuations for specific items by certain agents and attempts to distribute the items in a manner that balances the overall satisfaction among the agents.
