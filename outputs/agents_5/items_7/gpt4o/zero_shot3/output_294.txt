Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  67   2  31  64  95  92
1  37  56  82  72  10  77  57
2  16  55  12  73  91  74  68
3  22  82  74  49  43  48  57
4  98   2  11  40  73  82  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible. Given there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others. 

Let's begin by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for item 5 (95) and item 6 (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 (82) the most.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 (91) the most.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 (82) the most.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 (98) the most.

After assigning one item based on highest valuations to each agent, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 0

This accounts for 5 items. We have 2 remaining items (3 and 6) to allocate. We'll assign these based on the next highest valuations among the unassigned items.

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 2 values it at 73.
  - Agent 1 values it at 72.
  - Agent 4 values it at 40.
  - Agent 3 values it at 49.
  - Agent 0 values it at 31.
  
  Therefore, assign item 3 to Agent 2.

- **Item 6**:
  - Agent 0 values it at 92.
  - Agent 2 values it at 68.
  - Agent 1 values it at 57.
  - Agent 3 values it at 57.
  - Agent 4 values it at 33.
  
  Therefore, assign item 6 to Agent 0.

Now the final allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 0

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```
