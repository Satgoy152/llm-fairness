Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  48  60  84  64  29  30
1   1  30  91  83  99  63   6
2  86  12  69  90  17  68  52
3  93  21   6  94  34  25  69
4  26  44  15  46  28  56  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (93).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (48).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (91).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (94).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (99).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (68).
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most (69).

Now, let's ensure each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 4 currently has no items. We'll give them an item from another agent who has multiple items and a lower valuation for one of them. We can take item 1 from Agent 0 (value 48) since Agent 4 values it at 44, which is close.

Here's the final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0] (Value 27)
- Agent 1: [2, 4] (Values 91, 99)
- Agent 2: [5] (Value 68)
- Agent 3: [3, 6] (Values 94, 69)
- Agent 4: [1] (Value 44)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent has at least one item.

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
