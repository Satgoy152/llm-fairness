Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  70  34  13  85  78  21
1  52  82   7  97   0  97  37
2  91  26   9  18  17  96  70
3  70  79  96   2  17  73  10
4  66  29   0  12  10  18   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents who value them highly, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:** Check which agent values each item the most.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Item 0: Max value is 91 by Agent 2.
   - Item 1: Max value is 82 by Agent 1.
   - Item 2: Max value is 96 by Agent 3.
   - Item 3: Max value is 97 by Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Max value is 85 by Agent 0.
   - Item 5: Max value is 97 by Agent 1.
   - Item 6: Max value is 70 by Agent 2.

3. **Adjust Assignments to Ensure Fairness:**
   - Assign items primarily based on highest valuations.
   - Ensure each agent has at least one item, if possible, by reassigning some items if necessary.

4. **Final Adjustments to Ensure All Items are Allocated:**
   - Since Agent 4 has no items, reassign an item with a lower valuation from another agent to Agent 4 to ensure fairness.

Here is the allocation based on the above strategy:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 5
- Agent 2: Items 0, 6
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: (No items)

After reassignment to ensure Agent 4 gets an item:

- Reassign Item 6 from Agent 2 to Agent 4 (leaving Agent 2 with only Item 0).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents while maintaining a high degree of overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
