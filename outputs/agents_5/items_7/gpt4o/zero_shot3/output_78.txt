Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  89  15  24  47  91  32
1   3  24  56   4  61  75  23
2  30  19  43  91  78  65  39
3  59  37  44  40  99  48  80
4  74  90  51  72  94  58  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are assigned. A reasonable approach is to allocate items in such a way that the total value perceived by each agent is balanced.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to get a sense of their preferences.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes their total value, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's derive the allocations:

Agent 0:
- Values: [46, 89, 15, 24, 47, 91, 32]
- Total: 344

Agent 1:
- Values: [3, 24, 56, 4, 61, 75, 23]
- Total: 246

Agent 2:
- Values: [30, 19, 43, 91, 78, 65, 39]
- Total: 365

Agent 3:
- Values: [59, 37, 44, 40, 99, 48, 80]
- Total: 407

Agent 4:
- Values: [74, 90, 51, 72, 94, 58, 41]
- Total: 480

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 5 (value 91)
- Agent 1: Allocate item 4 (value 61)
- Agent 2: Allocate item 3 (value 91)
- Agent 3: Allocate items 6 (value 80)
- Agent 4: Allocate items 0, 1, 2 (values 74, 90, 51)

With this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total value is distributed as evenly as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
