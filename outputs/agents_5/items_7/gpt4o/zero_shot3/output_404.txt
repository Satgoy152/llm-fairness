Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  95  59  99  67  20  68
1  49  63  83   7  50  28  77
2  61  78  31  58  44  27  78
3  17  90  88  45   6  24  64
4   1  88  37   4  83   0  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences. Since there are 5 agents and 7 items, not all agents will receive the same number of items. We'll try to distribute the items to maximize fairness and total value.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 (Value: 99)
   - Item 6 (Value: 68)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 2 (Value: 83)
   - Item 5 (Value: 28)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 1 (Value: 78)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 0 (Value: 17)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Item 4 (Value: 83)

This allocation tries to assign items based on the highest value each agent has for the remaining items, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible, and the total number of items allocated equals 7.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
