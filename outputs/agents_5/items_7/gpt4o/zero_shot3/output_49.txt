Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  74  58  35  32  79  39
1  32  34  79  75  72   5  46
2   3  11  80  36  25   1  18
3  77  85  80  10  78  42  98
4   3  70  89  28  59  50  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive. We will use a simple heuristic approach to achieve a reasonable allocation.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 5 (value: 79)
   - Item 0 (value: 36)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 (value: 79)
   - Item 3 (value: 75)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 6 (value: 18)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 1 (value: 85)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 4 (value: 59)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to maximize the total value received by each agent according to their preferences. Let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This way, all 7 items are allocated, and the allocations are fairly balanced based on the agents' valuations.
