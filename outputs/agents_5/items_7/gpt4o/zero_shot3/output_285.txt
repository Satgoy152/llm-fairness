Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  52  73   0  31  68  30
1  88  10  39  51  44  65  35
2  46   1  23  93  85  51  12
3  34  53  28  65   4  49  42
4  95  63  55  54   4  70   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method to maximize the total value for each agent. 

Let's proceed step-by-step to allocate the items:

1. **Identify highest valued items for each agent**: We will try to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value the most.

2. **Allocate items**: Ensure that each item is allocated to only one agent and that all items are distributed.

Hereâ€™s a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most with a value of 82.
- Agent 1 values item 0 as well with a value of 88, but Agent 0 has already taken it, so we consider Agent 1's next highest value which is item 5 with a value of 65.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most with a value of 93.
- Agent 3 values item 3 as well but Agent 2 has it, so we consider Agent 3's next highest value which is item 1 with a value of 53.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most, but it is already taken. The next highest value for Agent 4 is item 5 which is also taken, so we consider item 1 with a value of 63.

Now, we ensure all items are allocated and adjust assignments where necessary:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [2, 4, 6]

With these allocations, we have covered all 7 items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value and that all items are distributed among the agents.
