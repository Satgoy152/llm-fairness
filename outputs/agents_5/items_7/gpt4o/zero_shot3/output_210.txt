Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  91  20  99  44  54  93
1  32   8  17  39  49   5  13
2   1  36   7  17  14  62  97
3  21  81  18  62  57  30  65
4  57  24  60  13  36  79  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, as there are 5 agents and 7 items. This means two agents will receive two items each, and the remaining three agents will receive one item each.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Identify Maximum Values**: First, we identify the highest value each agent has for any item to ensure they get the most value from their allocation.

2. **Assign Items Based on Maximum Values**: Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuation first, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Prioritize unique maximums to minimize conflicts, and handle conflicts by comparing the second-highest values.

3. **Resolve Conflicts and Final Allocation**: Adjust allocations to ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, while also trying to maximize their satisfaction.

### Step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 3 (99), allocate item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0 (32), allocate item 0.
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 6 (97), allocate item 6.
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 1 (81), allocate item 1.
- **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 5 (79), allocate item 5.

Now, all agents have at least one item. We have allocated 5 items, leaving items 2 and 4 unallocated.

- **Remaining Items**: 
  - Item 2: Agent 4 values it at 60 (highest among remaining options).
  - Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 44, which is reasonable considering their allocation.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all seven items are allocated in total.
