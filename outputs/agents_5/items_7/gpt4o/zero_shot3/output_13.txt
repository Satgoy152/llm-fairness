Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  55  17  43  55  27  44
1  92   3  11  22  69  96  83
2  74  76  56  30  64  67  57
3  64  63  29  90  73   9  89
4  83  18  92  51  40  11  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. Additionally, we need to ensure that every item is allocated to an agent, and every agent is included in the allocation, even if they receive no items.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Items: [2] 
   - Total value: 17

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Items: [5] 
   - Total value: 96

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Items: [0, 6] 
   - Total value: 74 + 57 = 131

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Items: [3] 
   - Total value: 90

5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Items: [1, 4] 
   - Total value: 18 + 40 = 58

This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their individual valuations of the items. Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated among the agents, respecting the constraints given.
