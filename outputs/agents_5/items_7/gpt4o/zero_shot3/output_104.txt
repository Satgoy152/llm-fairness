Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  28  62  23  14  83  11
1  82  55  10   1  38  51  84
2  47  17  45  92  23  37  83
3  81  81  63  85  23  33  17
4  81  26  93  12  24  56  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives. This is often done using a greedy algorithm or by solving an optimization problem, such as maximizing the sum of utilities.

Let's go through a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value for each agent:**  
   This helps us determine which items each agent values the most.

2. **Allocate items to the agents:**  
   Allocate the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each item is allocated only once.

3. **Ensure fairness:**  
   If an agent has no items, consider reallocating to achieve a more balanced distribution.

Below is the allocation process:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 5 the most (83).
- **Agent 1:** Values item 6 the most (84).
- **Agent 2:** Values item 3 the most (92).
- **Agent 3:** Values item 1 the most (81).
- **Agent 4:** Values item 2 the most (93).

After this initial allocation, we have:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [2]

Now we need to allocate items 0 and 4:
- Item 0 is valued highly by Agents 1 and 3, but since Agent 3 only has one item, give it to Agent 3.
- Item 4 is valued highly by Agent 1, and Agent 1 currently has one item.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [4, 6]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [0, 1]
- Agent 4: [2]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
