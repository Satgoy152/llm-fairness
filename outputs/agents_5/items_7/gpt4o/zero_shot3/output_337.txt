Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  46  64  61  68  15  36
1  36  16  72   8  91  54  69
2  77  22  54  80  86  14  48
3  53  25  85  60  38  71   2
4  24  11  95  47  77  52  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 46 64 61 68 15 36]
 [36 16 72  8 91 54 69]
 [77 22 54 80 86 14 48]
 [53 25 85 60 38 71  2]
 [24 11 95 47 77 52 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given in the table. The goal is to assign items in such a way that agents are satisfied with their allocations. An optimal approach could be to assign items to agents who value them the most.

Let's analyze the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the most with a value of 84.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the most with a value of 91.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the most with a value of 80.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the most with a value of 85.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the most with a value of 95.

Looking at the above, item 2 is valued highly by both agents 3 and 4. Since agent 4 values it the highest, we will allocate item 2 to agent 4. 

Now let's reassign the items considering the next highest values for each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the most (84), so we assign item 0 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the most (91), so we assign item 4 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Next highest value is item 3 (80), so we assign item 3 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Next highest value is item 5 (71), so we assign item 5 to agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 2 (95), next is item 6 (81), so we assign item 6 to agent 4.

Now we have assigned items 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. We still need to assign item 1:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 1 with 46.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 with 16.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 1 with 22.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 1 with 25.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 1 with 11.

Agent 0 values item 1 the most, so we assign item 1 to agent 0.

Finally, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 7 items are allocated.
