Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  91  72  38  69   9  49
1  63  13  90  62  94  24  75
2  63  39  30  32  14  66  16
3  27  72   9  34  66  90  43
4  11  64  30  92  81  54  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[61 91 72 38 69  9 49]
 [63 13 90 62 94 24 75]
 [63 39 30 32 14 66 16]
 [27 72  9 34 66 90 43]
 [11 64 30 92 81 54 59]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that every item is assigned to exactly one agent. We'll try to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation based on the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (valuation 91).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 (valuation 94) and item 2 (valuation 90).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (valuation 66).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 6 (valuation 43).
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 3 (valuation 92) and item 0 (valuation 11).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 0]
}
```
