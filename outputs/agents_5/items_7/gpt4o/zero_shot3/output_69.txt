Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  97  88   7  13  41   8
1  62  21  90  45  97  75  28
2  42  43  63  49  91  97  41
3  26  73  90  13  23  49  20
4  91  58  42  53  43  23  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we can use a simple allocation strategy. One common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This method ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, creating a fair distribution based on individual preferences. Let's apply this approach to the given table:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most at 91.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 and Agent 1 both value it at 90, but we'll assign it to Agent 3 for variety.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it at 49, the highest.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most at 69.

Now, let's prepare the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
