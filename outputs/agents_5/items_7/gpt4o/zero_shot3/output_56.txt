Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  42   3  89  52  84  52
1  58  16  43  70  74  51  10
2  62  50  29  59  56  92  90
3  75  63  73  86  71  23   1
4  89  32  75  20  27  56  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, the goal is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring all 7 items are distributed. One possible approach is to use a method that ensures each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize their total valuation.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. If an agent has no items after this step, reallocate items to ensure all agents have at least one item.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 63.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 73.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 89.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 74.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 92.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 90.

Now, check if all agents have at least one item:
- Agent 0 has items [0, 3].
- Agent 1 has item [4].
- Agent 2 has items [5, 6].
- Agent 3 has items [1, 2].
- Agent 4 has no items.

To ensure Agent 4 gets an item, we reallocate one item from the agent with the most items. Agent 0 has two items, so we'll reallocate item 3 to Agent 4, who values it second-highest after Agent 0.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
