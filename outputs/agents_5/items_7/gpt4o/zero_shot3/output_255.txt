Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  16  91  11  74  89   2
1   7  75  79  55  26  41  71
2  96  92  25  26  13  55   4
3  85  25   1  67  59  72  83
4   4  65  64  20  59   0  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here’s one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the highest valuation for each item and allocate it to the respective agent.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here’s how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 97.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 with 92.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 91.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 67.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 74.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 89.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 with 93.

After this allocation, Agent 1 does not have an item, so we need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness.

We can remove an item from Agent 0 and assign it to Agent 1, as Agent 0 has the most items:

- Reassign **Item 4** from Agent 0 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 has a relatively good valuation for it (26).

Below is the final allocation of items to agents:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives item 6.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent has received a fair share based on the valuations.
