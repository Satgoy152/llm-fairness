Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  14  39   8  62  83  79
1  70  53  95  37  86  12  74
2  46  59  85  22  49  26  57
3   6   6  84  64  58  80   8
4  45  96  12  31  84   0   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the following approach:

1. **Assign each item to the agent who values it most**: This ensures that each item goes to the agent who has the highest valuation for it, maximizing the overall satisfaction.

2. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible**: We will try to distribute items such that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, given the constraints.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (70)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 4 (96)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 1 (95)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 3 (64)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 4 (84)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (83)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (79)

After assigning the items to the agents with the highest valuations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Items 1, 4

This allocation ensures that the agents with the highest valuations receive the items, and all agents except Agent 2 receive at least one item. Since we have exactly 7 items and 5 agents, it is not possible to give an item to Agent 2 without removing one from another agent who values it more.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
