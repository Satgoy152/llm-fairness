Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  12  11  14  64  32  76
1  92  88  83  78  90  56   1
2  23  12  77  96  28  30   4
3  74  73  70  84  99  58  97
4  93  76  66  55  92  53  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize total satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation by each agent, making sure each agent receives at least one item.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated.

### Allocation Process:

- Agent 0: 
  - Highest value item: 6 (value 76)
  
- Agent 1:
  - Highest value item: 0 (value 92)
  
- Agent 2:
  - Highest value item: 3 (value 96)
  
- Agent 3:
  - Highest value item: 4 (value 99)
  
- Agent 4:
  - Highest value item: 1 (value 76)

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 5:
  - Agent 3 has the next highest valuation (58) for item 5.

- Item 2:
  - Agent 1 has the next highest valuation (83) for item 2.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, each agent gets at least one item, and total satisfaction based on the given valuations is reasonably high.
