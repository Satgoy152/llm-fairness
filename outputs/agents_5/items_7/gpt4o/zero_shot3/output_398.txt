Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  19  31  72  55  33  41
1  10  47  60  26  90  96  38
2  41  50  76  13  42  53  58
3  92  25  46  15  86  10  47
4  63  69  69  14  99   3  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for the items, aiming to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. We can use a simple method to allocate items by iterating through the items and assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets as close to an equal number of items as possible.

Here's a step-by-step process for the allocation:

1. **Identify Item Preferences**: Find out which agent values each item the most.
2. **Initial Assignment**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. **Balance the Allocation**: Ensure that each agent has an integer number of items and try to balance the allocations.

Using this approach, I will allocate the items.

### Item Preferences:
- Item 0: Agent 3 (value 92)
- Item 1: Agent 4 (value 69)
- Item 2: Agent 2 (value 76)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (value 72)
- Item 4: Agent 4 (value 99)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (value 96)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (value 58)

### Initial Assignment:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [2, 6]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [1, 4]

This allocation is balanced, with each agent receiving 1 or 2 items, and each item being allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
