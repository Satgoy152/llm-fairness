Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  57  75  12  49  83  92
1  27   5   0  54  97  48  63
2  68   0  60  95  12  27  90
3  88  20  72   8  64  30  24
4  86  47  22  15  72  15  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (92), so assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (97), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (95), so assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (88), so assign item 0 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (86), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 4 (72), but it's also taken. The highest remaining is item 1 (47), assign item 1 to agent 4.
6. We have items 2 and 5 left. Agent 0 values item 5 highly (83), assign item 5 to agent 0.
7. Finally, for item 2, agent 0 and agent 3 both have high valuations. Assign item 2 to agent 3 to balance their allocations.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has an integer number of items, all 7 items are allocated, and the allocation attempts to maximize the value for each agent based on their preferences.
