Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  42  67  72  92  71  43
1  46   1  55  15  15   5  51
2  47  65  82   7  40  51  70
3  35  68  60   4   3   6  77
4  90  47  34  38  34  13  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. We will use a simple approach to ensure fairness by assigning items to the agent who values them the most and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, wherever possible.

Let's analyze the table and make the allocations:

1. Find the highest valuation for each item and assign it to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item. If an agent does not have an item, we will reallocate based on the next highest valuation.

### Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:
- Item 0: Highest value is 90 (Agent 4)
- Item 1: Highest value is 68 (Agent 3)
- Item 2: Highest value is 82 (Agent 2)
- Item 3: Highest value is 72 (Agent 0)
- Item 4: Highest value is 92 (Agent 0)
- Item 5: Highest value is 71 (Agent 0)
- Item 6: Highest value is 85 (Agent 4)

### Adjusting to Ensure Fair Allocation:
- Agent 0 has more than one item (3 items), while Agent 1 has none.
- Reassign one of Agent 0's items to Agent 1 based on the next highest valuation:
  - Item 5: Agent 0 value is 71, the next highest is Agent 2 with a value of 51.
  - Reassign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Agent 1 still has no item. Reassign item 3 to Agent 1 since Agent 0 has item 4 and has the highest value for it.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 4
- Agent 1: Items 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Items 0, 6

### JSON Format of Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent gets an integer number of items, and the distribution is as fair as possible based on the given valuations.
