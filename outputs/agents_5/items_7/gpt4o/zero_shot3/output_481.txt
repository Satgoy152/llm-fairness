Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  46  79  72  21  15  50
1  16  42  85  79  28  78  17
2  11   0  96  51  55   8  52
3  49   7  90  49  71  52  94
4  49  10  87   4  62   1  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their valuations. We aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 3.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 5.
3. Agent 2 has high valuation for item 2.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 2 and 6.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 2 and 4.

To ensure all items are allocated and making sure each agent gets at least one item, we can proceed with the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Items 2, 6
- Agent 4: Item 4

This allocation ensures all 7 items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
