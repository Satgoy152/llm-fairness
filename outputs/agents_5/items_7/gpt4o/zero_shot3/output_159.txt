Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  80  87  60  44  55  44
1  76  23   0  57  44  19  23
2  72  13  91  11  93  32  49
3  34  41  34  92  20  99  58
4   2  41   4  21  30  49  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. To achieve this, we can use a greedy approach by assigning items to the agent who values them the most and ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal number of items wherever feasible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 70.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 80.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 91.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 92.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the highest at 93.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 99.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the highest at 50.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, while maintaining fairness in terms of the number of items allocated:

- Agents 0, 2, and 3 have two items each. To balance this out a bit more, we can try to reassign one item from agent 0 or 2 to agent 1 who currently has no items. Let's consider reassigning Item 1 from agent 0 to agent 1, as agent 1 has a reasonable value for item 1 compared to other unallocated items.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4
- Agent 3: Items 3, 5
- Agent 4: Item 6

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations wherever feasible.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [6]
}
```
