Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  44  24  37  38  44   6
1  44  32  68  15  71  56  20
2  12  32  27  57  18   2  16
3  26  60  90  45  51  12  95
4  59  51  26  75  36  12  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and the total number of items. We have 5 agents and 7 items, so some agents will receive more than one item while others might not receive any. The aim is to ensure that the allocation is fair based on the valuations given, trying to maximize the overall satisfaction.

One approach is to use a variant of the "maximum weight matching" in bipartite graphs to allocate items based on the highest total valuation. However, for simplicity, let's manually assign items to ensure no agent feels unfairly treated based on their valuation.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Allocate item 2 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it the highest (90).
2. Allocate item 4 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest (71).
3. Allocate item 3 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it the highest (75).
4. Allocate item 0 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest (84).
5. Allocate item 1 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it the second highest (60).
6. Allocate item 6 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it the highest (95).
7. Allocate item 5 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest (56).

This allocation is based on maximizing the individual satisfaction of each agent by considering their highest valued items first.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
