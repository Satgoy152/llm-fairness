Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  99  97  78  26  74  46
1  15  64  99  73  20   9  81
2  94  28  65  64  43  95  64
3  97   3  69  57  35  40  47
4   9  51  73   1  46  17  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total value. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations. However, we must ensure each agent is considered and only 7 items are distributed in total.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Start by selecting the highest value for each agent and allocate the corresponding item.
2. Continue assigning the remaining items based on the highest unallocated valuation for any agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 1 (99).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 2 (99).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 5 (95).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 0 (97).
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 6 (93).

Now, we have allocated 5 out of 7 items. Let's allocate the remaining 2 items based on the next highest valuations:

- Item 3 is valued highly by Agent 0 (78).
- Item 4 is valued highly by Agent 2 (43).

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value most, and all 7 items are distributed.
