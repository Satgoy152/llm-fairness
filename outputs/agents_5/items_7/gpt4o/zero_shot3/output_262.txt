Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  63  76  13  79  43  94
1   1  34  31  33  26  86  51
2  96  32  74   4  84  61  48
3  93   7   3  88  39  84  46
4  35  35  41  92  35  11  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integral number of items and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values: [40, 63, 76, 13, 79, 43, 94]
   - Highest value is 94 for item 6.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [1, 34, 31, 33, 26, 86, 51]
   - Highest value is 86 for item 5.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [96, 32, 74, 4, 84, 61, 48]
   - Highest value is 96 for item 0.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [93, 7, 3, 88, 39, 84, 46]
   - Highest value is 93 for item 0, but since item 0 is already allocated, consider item 3 with value 88.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Values: [35, 35, 41, 92, 35, 11, 20]
   - Highest value is 92 for item 3, but since item 3 is allocated, consider item 2 with value 41.

The allocation can be adjusted until all items are fairly distributed among the agents:

- **Agent 0** gets item [6].
- **Agent 1** gets item [5].
- **Agent 2** gets item [0].
- **Agent 3** gets item [3].
- **Agent 4** gets items [1, 2, 4].

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
