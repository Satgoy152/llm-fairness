Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  55  31  71  20  91  30
1  23  92   6  74  63  93  90
2  30  21  91  95  34  99   9
3  22  20  10  14  12  91  59
4  28  18  78   0  42  12  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Let's try to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5.
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 because Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3.
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
5. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 6.
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4 because Agent 4 has a relatively high valuation for item 2 and other high-value items have been allocated.
7. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 because Agent 1 has the second-highest valuation for item 4 and Agent 1 has fewer items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, maximizing the total valuation for each agent based on the given table.
