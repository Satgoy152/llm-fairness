Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  71  18  58  12  86  80
1  32  51  84  39  98  83  54
2  53  21   8  59   1  90  60
3  28  42  77  29  86   5  87
4  82  54  76  70  60  12  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are distributed among the 5 agents. A possible approach is to try to maximize the total valuation for each agent, ensuring that no items are left unallocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (value 86)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 4 (value 98)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 2 (value 84)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (value 90), but it's already allocated to Agent 0
   - Second highest valued item: Item 6 (value 60)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 6 (value 87), but it's already allocated to Agent 2
   - Second highest valued item: Item 4 (value 86), but it's already allocated to Agent 1
   - Third highest valued item: Item 2 (value 77)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (value 82)
   - Second highest valued item: Item 6 (value 83), but it's already allocated to Agent 2
   - Allocate the remaining unallocated item: Item 1 (value 54)

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Items 0 and 1

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
