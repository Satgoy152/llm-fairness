Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  14  80  84  24  86  76
1  44  70  44   9  27  25  21
2  45  31  13  55  26  26  77
3  36   0  12  41  33   1  49
4  64  25   0  64  87  67  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and that the allocations maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Here's one way to allocate these items:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 5.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 3.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 4.

For the remaining items (0 and 2), the allocation is as follows:
- **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 2, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
- **Agent 4** has the highest remaining valuation for item 0, so assign item 0 to agent 4.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation assigns all items to agents and ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items with a focus on maximizing their respective valuations.
