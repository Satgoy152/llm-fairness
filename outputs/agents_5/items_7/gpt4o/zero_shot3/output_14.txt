Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2   3  23  66  12  35  47
1  77  95  13  76  93  73  75
2  96   5  23  65  84  88  76
3  55  89  11  93  98  34  22
4  96  33  67  91  20  35  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy strategy, allocating each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Valuations: [2, 77, 96, 55, 96]
   - Highest valuation by agent 2 and agent 4 (both 96)
   - Allocate to agent 2 (or 4 based on tie-breaking)

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Valuations: [3, 95, 5, 89, 33]
   - Highest valuation by agent 1 (95)
   - Allocate to agent 1

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Valuations: [23, 13, 23, 11, 67]
   - Highest valuation by agent 4 (67)
   - Allocate to agent 4

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Valuations: [66, 76, 65, 93, 91]
   - Highest valuation by agent 3 (93)
   - Allocate to agent 3

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Valuations: [12, 93, 84, 98, 20]
   - Highest valuation by agent 3 (98)
   - Allocate to agent 3

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Valuations: [35, 73, 88, 34, 35]
   - Highest valuation by agent 2 (88)
   - Allocate to agent 2

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Valuations: [47, 75, 76, 22, 70]
   - Highest valuation by agent 2 (76)
   - Allocate to agent 2

After allocation, ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 5, 6],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the overall valuation satisfaction among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
