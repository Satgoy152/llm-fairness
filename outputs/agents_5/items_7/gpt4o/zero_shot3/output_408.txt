Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  79  16  54  19   6  12
1  62  73  66  47  53   7  68
2  60  88  97  61  91  50  65
3  77  74   3  19  41  45  34
4  69   6  47  34  81  93   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction is balanced. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation item: Item 1 (value 79)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation item: Item 6 (value 68)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation item: Item 2 (value 97)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation item: Item 0 (value 77)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuation item: Item 5 (value 93)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 4

Now, we still need to allocate Items 3 and 4. We'll consider the next highest valuations for each agent:

- **Agent 1** has a relatively high valuation for Item 4 (value 53). Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 4** has a relatively high valuation for Item 3 (value 34). Assign Item 3 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item based on their highest or next highest preferences. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 3]
}
```
