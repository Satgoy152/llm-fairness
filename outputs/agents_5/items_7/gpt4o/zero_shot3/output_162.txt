Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  37  83   5  47  39  73
1  59  26  75  98  93  88  93
2  45  49  25  11  84  62  43
3  59  94  74  36  90  48  28
4  73  15  49  13  96  65  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [59 26 75 98 93 88 93]
 [45 49 25 11 84 62 43]
 [59 94 74 36 90 48 28]
 [73 15 49 13 96 65 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Valuations are [48, 37, 83, 5, 47, 39, 73]. The highest valuation is for item 2 (83).
2. Agent 1: Valuations are [59, 26, 75, 98, 93, 88, 93]. The highest valuation is for item 3 (98).
3. Agent 2: Valuations are [45, 49, 25, 11, 84, 62, 43]. The highest valuation is for item 4 (84).
4. Agent 3: Valuations are [59, 94, 74, 36, 90, 48, 28]. The highest valuation is for item 1 (94).
5. Agent 4: Valuations are [73, 15, 49, 13, 96, 65, 20]. The highest valuation is for item 4 (96), but it's already allocated to Agent 2. The next highest is item 5 (65).

Considering these choices, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 6. Let's assign them based on the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0 can get item 6 (73).
- Agent 4 can get item 0 (73).

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 0]
}
```
