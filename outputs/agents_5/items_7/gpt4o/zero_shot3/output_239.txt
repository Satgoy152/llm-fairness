Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  43  48  59  87  37  71
1  61  42  77  99  45  66  17
2  87  72   9  15  31  81  85
3  92  40  56  85  40  84  62
4  81  26  20  67  70  65   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. This approach ensures that each agent gets items that they particularly value highly, leading to a fair distribution based on their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most (87), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most (99), so assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (87), so assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most, but it is already taken, so assign the next highest value item 5 (84) to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the most, but it is already taken, so assign the next highest value item 3 (67) to Agent 4.
6. Now, item 1 is valued highly by Agent 0 (43), but Agent 0 already has an item. Assign item 1 to Agent 3, who values it at 40.
7. Lastly, item 2 is left, and Agent 1 values item 2 the most (77), so assign item 2 to Agent 1.

This leaves us with the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while respecting their individual preferences as much as possible.
