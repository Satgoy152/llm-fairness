Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  36   9  78  58  69  56
1  80  98  43  84  43  14  86
2  99  68  25  89  47  43  68
3  91  37  34  87  10  66  60
4  32  48   9  41  31   7  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (since there are 5 agents and 7 items, two agents will receive two items each).

First, we need to determine which items are most valuable to each agent. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest value for each agent:**  
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (78)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (98)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (99)
   - Agent 3: Item 0 (91)
   - Agent 4: Item 6 (80)

2. **Allocate the highest value items to each agent:**  
   - Agent 0 gets Item 3
   - Agent 1 gets Item 1
   - Agent 2 gets Item 0
   - Agent 3 gets Item 4 (as Item 0 is already taken, next highest is Item 3, but it's taken, so Item 4 with value 10)
   - Agent 4 gets Item 6

3. **Allocate remaining items to maximize total value:**  
   Remaining items: 2, 5

   - Agent 0: Can take Item 5 (69)
   - Agent 3: Can take Item 2 (34)

4. **Final Allocation:**

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 2],
    "4": [6]
}
```

Each agent is allocated their most valuable item wherever possible, and the remaining items are distributed to maximize the value for each agent.
