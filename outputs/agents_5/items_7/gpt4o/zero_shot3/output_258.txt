Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  36  97  64  32  50  43
1  24  11  59  33  85  45  68
2  18  72   8  17  66  20  30
3  51  30   3  41  68  77  17
4  15   3  68  64  72  13  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all 7 items are distributed among the 5 agents. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is 51 by Agent 3.
- Item 1: Highest valuation is 72 by Agent 2.
- Item 2: Highest valuation is 97 by Agent 0.
- Item 3: Highest valuation is 64 by Agents 0 and 4. Assign to Agent 0 to balance distribution.
- Item 4: Highest valuation is 85 by Agent 1.
- Item 5: Highest valuation is 77 by Agent 3.
- Item 6: Highest valuation is 68 by Agent 1.

This initial allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 0, 5
- Agent 4: No items

To ensure all agents receive at least one item:
- Consider reallocating one item from an agent with multiple items to Agent 4.

Revised Allocation:
- Move Item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 4.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 0, 5
- Agent 4: Item 3

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
