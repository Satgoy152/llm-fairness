Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  13  82  27  18  43  87
1   4  40  11  76  55  19  11
2   9  26  60  27  24  23  60
3  91   9  45  78  43  71  45
4  34  76  27  63  60  45   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method called "Maximum Marginal Value" where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Since there are 7 items and 5 agents, two agents will receive two items while the remaining will receive one item each.

Let's go through the table to allocate the items:

1. Look at each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item by reallocating if necessary.

### Step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most (91).
- **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most (76).
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (82).
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most (78).
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (55).
- **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most (71).
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most (87).

### Check allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items []
- Agent 3: Items [0, 3, 5]
- Agent 4: Items [1]

### Reallocations if necessary:

Since Agent 2 doesn't have any items, we need to reallocate one item. We can choose an item from an agent who has more than one item. Let's move Item 3 from Agent 3 to Agent 2, as Agent 3 has three items.

### Final allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items [3]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 4: Items [1]

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
