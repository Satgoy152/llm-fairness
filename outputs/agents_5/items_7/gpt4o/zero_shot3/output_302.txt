Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  33  35  61  96  54  12
1  93  19  30  43  38  56  58
2  81  39  60  53  58  19  85
3  85  25  57  18  90  50  91
4  37   8  56  11  52  77  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest individual value for item 4 at 96. Assigning item 4 to Agent 0 maximizes their gain, and it is a good start for balancing overall value among the agents.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent has the highest value for item 0 at 93. Assigning item 0 to Agent 1 maximizes their gain.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has multiple high values, but assigning item 6, where they have a value of 85, gives them a competitive value.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent has high values for items 4 and 6, but since those are already allocated, we look at item 3 with a value of 18. Assigning item 3 to Agent 3 is a reasonable choice given the remaining options.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent has a moderate distribution of values, but assigning item 5, where they have a value of 77, maximizes their value from the remaining unallocated items.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 2. Here is a possible way to complete the allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0; this helps balance Agent 0's total value.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2; this further balances Agent 2's allocated value.

The resulting allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents while attempting to balance the total value each agent receives.
