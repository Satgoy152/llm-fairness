Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  31  56  75  74  97  25
1  97  86  18  75  85  68  63
2   0  39  35   8  85  93  30
3  38  29  23  16  87  79  33
4  93  74  58  41  37  24  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. This involves ensuring each agent receives a fair value of items while also making sure that all items are allocated.

Let's aim for a balanced distribution based on the highest valuations by each agent. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 4, 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 4, 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- **Item 0**: High valuation by Agent 0 and also by Agent 1, let's allocate to Agent 1 (since Agent 0 can take item 5 which Agent 1 values less).
- **Item 1**: High valuation by Agent 1, allocate to Agent 4.
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 4, who values it reasonably.
- **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 0, who has no other item from his high value set.
- **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 3.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item while aiming to respect their valuation preferences.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
