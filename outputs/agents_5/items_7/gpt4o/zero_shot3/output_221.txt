Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4  93  22  92  28  71  41
1  49  69  98  99  93  21  79
2  15  56  61  85  91  35  56
3  78  97  48  44  74  35   2
4  75  83  25  34  62  46  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a system where each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated. Given that there are 7 items and 5 agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that reflects the agents' preferences as much as possible. 

Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items are 1 (93) and 3 (92). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items are 3 (99) and 2 (98). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items are 4 (91) and 3 (85). Since item 3 is already assigned, assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items are 1 (97) and 0 (78). Since item 1 is already assigned, assign item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value items are 1 (83) and 0 (75). Since both items 0 and 1 are already assigned, assign item 5 (46) to Agent 4.

After assigning at least one item to each agent based on their highest valuations, we need to allocate the remaining items 2 and 6. We'll assign them to agents who have relatively higher valuations for these items:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (98).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (79).

Now, each item is allocated, and every agent has at least one item. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 2, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```
