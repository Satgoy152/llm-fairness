Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  68   1  74  51  41  92
1  57  28  87  46  18  41  48
2  79  16  23  42  69  17  88
3  31  26   1  56  39  44   4
4  57   3  30  49  40  85  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [57  3 30 49 40 85 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 6 (92)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (87)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 0 (79)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (44)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued item: Item 5 (85), but since it's already taken, choose the next highest available item: Item 3 (49)

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items. Let's distribute them to ensure a fair allocation:

6. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest available item: Item 3 (74) - already taken by Agent 4, so skip.
   - Next highest available item: Item 1 (68)

7. **Agent 4**:
   - Next highest available item: Item 4 (40)

Now each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
