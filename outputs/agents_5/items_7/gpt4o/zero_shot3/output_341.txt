Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  29  88  26  60  32  37
1  45  88  81  18  16  98  11
2  30  54  65   1  72  13  49
3  84  86  43  45   0  75   4
4  37  19  30  67   1  25  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. This involves assigning items to agents so that their valuations for the items they receive are high. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that every item is allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Valuations: [60, 45, 30, 84, 37]
   - Agent 3 values it the most with 84.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Valuations: [29, 88, 54, 86, 19]
   - Agent 1 values it the most with 88.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Valuations: [88, 81, 65, 43, 30]
   - Agent 0 values it the most with 88.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Valuations: [26, 18, 1, 45, 67]
   - Agent 4 values it the most with 67.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Valuations: [60, 16, 72, 0, 1]
   - Agent 2 values it the most with 72.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Valuations: [32, 98, 13, 75, 25]
   - Agent 1 values it the most with 98.

7. **Item 6:**
   - Valuations: [37, 11, 49, 4, 80]
   - Agent 4 values it the most with 80.

Now, let's assign the items based on these valuations:

- Agent 0 receives item 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 0.
- Agent 4 receives items 3 and 6.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
