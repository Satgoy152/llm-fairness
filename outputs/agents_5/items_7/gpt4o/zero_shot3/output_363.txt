Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   5  61  77  41  48  43  11
1  51  21  70  56  31  42  56
2  87  73  87  87  87   0  21
3   8  76  47  40  67   3  97
4  68  39  73  68   0  67  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item wherever possible. We also need to ensure that all 7 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items are 2 (77), 1 (61), and 4 (48).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items are 2 (70), 3 (56), and 6 (56).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items are 0 (87), 2 (87), 3 (87), and 4 (87).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items are 6 (97), 1 (76), and 4 (67).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valued items are 2 (73), 0 (68), 3 (68), and 5 (67).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 4. We should allocate these to maximize the value received by the agents:

- **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most (76).
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it (67) and is the highest among remaining options.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [1, 6, 4]
- Agent 4: [5]

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item according to their highest valuations where possible.

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 6, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```
