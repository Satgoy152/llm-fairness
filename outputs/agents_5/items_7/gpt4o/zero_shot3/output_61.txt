Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  21  55  60  93  21  82
1  53  72  82  37  51  57  33
2  58  90   8  50  65  30  29
3  34  34  82   1  90  71  86
4  79  73  37  50  61  84   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one way to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent.
2. Start by allocating the item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6
- Agent 4: No items

Let's verify that each item is allocated and that the total count of items is correct:

- Item 0: Agent 2
- Item 1: Agent 1
- Item 2: Agent 1
- Item 3: Agent 3
- Item 4: Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 0
- Item 6: Agent 3

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their respective valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": []
}
```
