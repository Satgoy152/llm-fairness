Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  97   7  93   1  67  32
1  11  55  94  80   3  22  75
2  98  10  30  17   0  30  65
3  82  17  11  77  46  40  52
4  28  59  69   1  74  21  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly to the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while also ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step analysis for a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values for Agent 0 are for items: 1 (97), 3 (93), and 5 (67).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values for Agent 1 are for items: 2 (94), 3 (80), and 6 (75).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values for Agent 2 are for items: 0 (98), 6 (65), and 3 (17).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values for Agent 3 are for items: 0 (82), 3 (77), and 4 (46).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest values for Agent 4 are for items: 4 (74), 2 (69), and 1 (59).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Next, allocate the remaining items to the agents that would maximize their total value:

- Item 5 is left, highest value for item 5 is for Agent 0 (67).
- Item 6 is left, highest value for item 6 is for Agent 1 (75).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 5]
- Agent 1: [2, 6]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
