Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  95  14   0  90  68  97
1  19  20   1  85  56  28  82
2  84  35  20  90  75  36  85
3  54  88   8  29  30  20  81
4  10  45  16   8  57  12  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. 

Let's evaluate each item:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0: 41
  - Agent 1: 19
  - Agent 2: 84 (highest value)
  - Agent 3: 54
  - Agent 4: 10
  
  Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0: 95 (highest value)
  - Agent 1: 20
  - Agent 2: 35
  - Agent 3: 88
  - Agent 4: 45
  
  Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0: 14
  - Agent 1: 1
  - Agent 2: 20 (highest value)
  - Agent 3: 8
  - Agent 4: 16
  
  Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0: 0
  - Agent 1: 85 (highest value)
  - Agent 2: 90 (highest value)
  - Agent 3: 29
  - Agent 4: 8
  
  Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (Agent 2 has a slightly higher value than Agent 1).

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0: 90 (highest value)
  - Agent 1: 56
  - Agent 2: 75
  - Agent 3: 30
  - Agent 4: 57
  
  Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.

- **Item 5**: 
  - Agent 0: 68
  - Agent 1: 28
  - Agent 2: 36
  - Agent 3: 20
  - Agent 4: 12 (highest value)
  
  Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

- **Item 6**: 
  - Agent 0: 97 (highest value)
  - Agent 1: 82
  - Agent 2: 85
  - Agent 3: 81
  - Agent 4: 89
  
  Assign Item 6 to Agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4, 5, 6
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2, 3
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: No items

So, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 3],
    "3": [],
    "4": []
}
```
