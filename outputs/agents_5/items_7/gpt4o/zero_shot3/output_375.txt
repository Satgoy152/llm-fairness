Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  83  87  87  92  91  40
1  37  41  62  75  52  45  98
2  56  18  47  39   0  69   2
3  66  64  33  80  18  31  87
4  42  46   1  42  75  36  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 7. To achieve fairness, we can consider the valuations that each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the total value for each agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 highly, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 6, so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5, so we allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highly, so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 0, so we allocate item 0 to agent 4.
6. We need to allocate item 1 and item 2, and we can allocate them based on remaining preferences:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2, so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
   - Agent 3 values item 1 moderately, so allocate item 1 to agent 3.

This ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items, and all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
