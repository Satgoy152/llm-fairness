Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  23  37  24  30  48  37
1  54  67  42  90  26  78  14
2  45  11  58  65  87  53  45
3  39  81  14  33  39   8  65
4   7  11  20  97  51  92   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will try to give priority to agents based on their highest valuations for certain items, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Valuations are moderate across the board; we might prioritize items that aren't strongly desired by others.
- Agent 1: Highly values item 3 and 5.
- Agent 2: Highly values item 4.
- Agent 3: Highly values item 1.
- Agent 4: Highly values item 3 but is not the highest for any other items.

An allocation strategy focusing on maximizing agent satisfaction could look like this:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (second-highest valuation, after agent 1 who already has item 3).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (highest valuation).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (moderate valuation, less competition).
6. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation, after agent 0 who already has item 2).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (moderate valuation, less competition).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's satisfaction by considering the highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
