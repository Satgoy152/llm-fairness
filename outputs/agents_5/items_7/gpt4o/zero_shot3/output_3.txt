Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  12  94  26  92  55  35
1  95  28  39  86  41   0  18
2  20  47  99  82  50  93  71
3  79   5  20  12  10  49   1
4  97  29  54  12  69  61  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's evaluate and distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent.

Here are the steps and considerations in the allocation process:

1. **Identify highest valuations**: For each item, identify the agent that values it the most. This will guide us to allocate items where they are most valued.
  
2. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Make sure each item is allocated to an agent, and that the distribution is fair, balancing the number of items each agent receives as evenly as possible.

3. **Balancing**: Since there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Aim to distribute the items so that the difference in the number of items received by any two agents is minimized.

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 95, the highest among all agents.
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 47, the highest among all agents.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it at 99, the highest among all agents.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 26, but Agent 1 values it at 86, which is higher.
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 92, the highest among all agents.
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it at 93, the highest among all agents.
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it at 71, but Agent 0 values it at 35, which is lower. Agent 1 values it at 18, which is lower than Agent 2.

Now, let's assign the items based on these valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: [4] (Item 4 is highly valued by Agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: [0, 3] (Items 0 and 3 are highly valued by Agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: [1, 2, 5, 6] (Items 1, 2, 5, and 6 are highly valued by Agent 2)
- **Agent 3**: [] (No items are highly valued by Agent 3)
- **Agent 4**: [] (No items are highly valued by Agent 4)

Let's format this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 2, 5, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": []
}
```
