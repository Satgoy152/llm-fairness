Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  87  28  44  98  71  32
1  52  56  23  34  56  52  29
2  76  38  86  20  50  51  48
3   2  51  48  41  11   2   8
4  91  89  14  59  16   0  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations for the items. One common approach is to give each agent the item they value the most, while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest (98).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest (86).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it the highest (91).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it second highest (89).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it third highest (59).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the second highest (71).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it fourth highest (91).

Let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 1, 3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned and the distribution is fair based on the given valuations.
