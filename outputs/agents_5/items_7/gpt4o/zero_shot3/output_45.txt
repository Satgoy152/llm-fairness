Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  55  34  72  56   2  39
1  41  82  76  29   3  53  17
2  91  47  15  66  89  16  70
3  36  99  82  94  34  62  57
4  68  97  24  85  81   5  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item by each agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 2 values it the most (91).

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 3 values it the most (99).

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 1 values it the most (76).

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 3 values it the most (94).

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 2 values it the most (89).

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 3 values it the most (62).

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 2 values it the most (70).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:
- Agent 0 has no items. We can assign item 0 to Agent 0 instead, who values it second highest (67).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 4, 6
- Agent 3: Items 1, 3, 5
- Agent 4: No items

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1, 3, 5],
    "4": []
}
```
