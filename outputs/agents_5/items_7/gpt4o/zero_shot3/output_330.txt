Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  46  76  65  83   5  45
1  99  67  78   2  27   8  55
2  29   8  17  28  84  50  31
3  25  60  41   4  10  61  95
4  97  89  47  12  66  14  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the valuations are balanced. One approach is to assign items to agents based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 4 (value 97), as agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 89), as agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 1.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 76), as agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 65), as agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 83), as agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 61), as agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value 95), as agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6.

Under this allocation, each agent receives items maximizing their individual valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that agent 0 and agent 3 get the highest value items available to them, while agent 4 receives two high-value items. Agents 1 and 2 receive no items in this allocation.
