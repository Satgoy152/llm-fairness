Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  83  20  46  52   3  16
1  39  91   4   6  59  34   0
2  45  27  93  31  12  19  26
3  29  19  78  36  35  44  14
4  62  58  63  45  12  71   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly, so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most, so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2, so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5, so allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0, so allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
6. Since Agent 0 now has only one item, allocate item 3, which they value next highest among remaining items, to Agent 0.
7. Finally, allocate item 6 to Agent 4, as they have the next highest valuation for the remaining item.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
