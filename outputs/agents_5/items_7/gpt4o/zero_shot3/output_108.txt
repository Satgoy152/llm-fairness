Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43   3  43  84  77  75  40
1  95  49  35  48  47  53  14
2   5  24  69  69  65  55  53
3   1  58  84  20  33   6  64
4   7  97  47   7  75   7   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Valuation = 43
   - Item 3: Valuation = 84
   - Total Valuation = 127

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1: Valuation = 49
   - Total Valuation = 49

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2: Valuation = 69
   - Total Valuation = 69

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 6: Valuation = 64
   - Total Valuation = 64

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 4: Valuation = 75
   - Item 5: Valuation = 7
   - Total Valuation = 82

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. The allocation is done by choosing the highest possible valuation for each item while considering fair distribution.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
