Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  88  82  92  82  39  40
1  98  43  68  14  93  21   2
2  33  16  45  95  28  10  70
3   8  50  20  56  54  25   7
4   4  96  34  54  79  43  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 96 34 54 79 43 58]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 3. We'll assign item 3 (value 92) to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 2. We'll assign item 0 (value 98) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 3, but since it's already taken, we'll assign item 6 (value 70) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a valuation for item 1 that isn't the highest, but it's reasonable since other higher-valued items are assigned. We'll assign item 1 (value 50) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has a high valuation for item 4. We'll assign item 4 (value 79) to Agent 4.

Now, we have two items left to allocate: items 2 and 5. We'll assign these based on the remaining highest valuations:

- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 0 (value 82).
- **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 4 (value 43).

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 7.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
