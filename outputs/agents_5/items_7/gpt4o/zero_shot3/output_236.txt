Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  84  24  91  18   7  92
1  95  55  97   5  50  93  23
2  96  82  46  14  65  49  90
3  18  27  17  43  29  74  81
4  58  14  60   3  71  80  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Let's distribute the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 and 6 highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 0, 2, and 5 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 and 6 highly.
4. Agent 3 has a relatively lower valuation across the board.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 highly.

Here's one potential allocation that attempts to maximize overall satisfaction:

- Agent 0: [3] (valued at 91)
- Agent 1: [2, 5] (valued at 97 and 93)
- Agent 2: [6] (valued at 90)
- Agent 3: [4] (valued at 29)
- Agent 4: [0, 1] (valued at 58 and 14)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
