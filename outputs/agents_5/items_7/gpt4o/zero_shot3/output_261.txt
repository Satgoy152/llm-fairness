Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  89  59  86  79  58   9
1   5  68  17  50  94  66  63
2  15  17  60  19  21  16  47
3  47  65  88   2  19  94  92
4  49  89   2   0  64   0  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 89 59 86 79 58  9]
 [ 5 68 17 50 94 66 63]
 [15 17 60 19 21 16 47]
 [47 65 88  2 19 94 92]
 [49 89  2  0 64  0 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations and attempt to balance the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible fair allocation approach:

1. **Analyze the valuations**: Check the valuations each agent has for each item.
2. **Assign items to agents**: Try to maximize the satisfaction (sum of values) for each agent and ensure no agent gets more than their fair share if possible.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 7 items are distributed among the 5 agents. Each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocation aims to consider their preferences.
