Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37   9  38  25  22  73   2
1   8  53  47  15   3  45  61
2  71  32   0  92   3  66  26
3   9  78  27  41  84  24  41
4  93  26  10  77   1  61  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (where possible) and a total of 7 items are allocated. Let's evaluate the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values for items 5 (73), 2 (38), and 0 (37).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values for items 1 (53), 2 (47), and 6 (61).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values for items 3 (92) and 0 (71).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values for items 4 (84) and 1 (78).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values for items 0 (93) and 3 (77).

Considering these valuations and aiming to allocate one item per agent initially while maximizing their satisfaction:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 because it's the highest valued item for them.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 because it's the highest valued item for them.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 because it's their most valued item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 because it's the highest valued.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 because it's the highest valued.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items. We should consider the next highest values:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they have a relatively high value for it and they can get a second item.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it's their second-highest valued item.

Now, all 7 items have been allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed based on the agents' valuations, maintaining fairness in terms of maximizing individual satisfaction.
