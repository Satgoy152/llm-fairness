Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76   8  67  73  30  51  55
1  76  43  82  98  78  50  38
2  70  61  19  50  46  88   8
3  30  83  83   6  47  66   2
4  72   4  43  19  95  34   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple approach where we try to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will consider each agent's preference and try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item where possible, while also maximizing the overall satisfaction.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (76) compared to other items. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (98). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (88). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 and item 2 equally (83), but since item 1 is not taken, assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (95). Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have 2 items left: item 2 and item 6. We need to distribute these in a way that maintains fairness:

6. Agent 1 has the second-highest valuation for item 2 (82). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
7. Agent 0 has the second-highest valuation for item 6 (55). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

This way, all items are allocated fairly based on the agents' valuations.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
