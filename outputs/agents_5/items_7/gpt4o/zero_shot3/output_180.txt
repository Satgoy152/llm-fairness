Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  29  97  64  23  71   1
1  93  28  54  97  22  44  51
2  78  59  19  48   1  93  64
3  32  20  30  34  44  44   8
4  50  82  40  70   3  28  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 28 54 97 22 44 51]
 [78 59 19 48  1 93 64]

 [50 82 40 70  3 28 73]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, and redistribute if necessary.

Let's analyze the table:

- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 1 (93).
- Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 4 (82).
- Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0 (97).
- Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 1 (97).
- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 3 (44).
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 2 (93).
- Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 4 (73).

With this allocation based on highest valuations:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.
- Agent 4 gets items 1 and 6.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.
