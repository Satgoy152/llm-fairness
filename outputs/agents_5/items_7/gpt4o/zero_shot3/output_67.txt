Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  17  19  39  73  41  16
1  21   5  82  13  83  29  96
2  64  94  80  11  29  83  90
3  64  21  87  35  10  11  42
4  27  96  62  24  55  67  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent gets items they value highly. This approach aims to maximize overall satisfaction. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 and item 4 highly. Assign items 0 and 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 and item 4 highly. Assign item 6 to agent 1 (since item 4 is already allocated to agent 0).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 and item 5 highly. Assign items 1 and 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly. Assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 highly but it's already allocated to agent 2, so assign item 3 to agent 4.

This allocation fairly distributes the items based on the agents' preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 5 agents.
