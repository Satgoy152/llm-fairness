Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  72  68   9  15  24  26
1  64  21  32  76  42  25  12
2  67  31  45  63  16  67  91
3  14  82   6  66  46   4   8
4  34  83   0  63  61  25  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given that there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more than one item. Let's try to make this as fair as possible based on the given valuations:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (77)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (76)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 6 (91)
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (82)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (83, but already taken by Agent 3), next highest is Item 4 (61)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 4

Now, 5 items are allocated, and 2 items remain to be allocated among the 5 agents. Let's allocate these remaining items based on next highest valuations:

6. **Remaining Items: 2, 5**

   - **Agent 0**:
     - Remaining valuations: Item 2 (68), Item 5 (24)
     - Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 (higher valuation)

   - **Agent 2**:
     - Remaining valuations: Item 5 (67)
     - Assign Item 5 to Agent 2 (as it is the only remaining high valuation)

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution aims to fairly maximize the individual valuations based on the highest values available for each agent.
