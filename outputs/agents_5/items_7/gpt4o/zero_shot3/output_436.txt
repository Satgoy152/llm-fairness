Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  48  51  70  21   6  47
1  72  71  70  96  82  48  32
2  39  74  37  29  10  14  11
3  48  28   1  40  98  84  31
4   9  98  16  22  85  85  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and that all items are allocated. This can be challenging due to the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and there are a limited number of items to distribute. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Sort agents by their highest valuation for any item.
2. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.
3. Adjust assignments to ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (96).
2. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (98).
3. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (98).
4. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (74).
5. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (74).

Initial assignment based on highest valuations:
- Agent 1: item 3
- Agent 4: item 1
- Agent 3: item 4
- Agent 0: item 0

Now, we have 3 items remaining (2, 5, 6) and need to ensure all agents get at least one item.

Let's assign the remaining items:
- Agent 2: item 2 (since their highest valuation item, 1, is already taken)
- Agent 0: item 5 (next highest valuation)
- Agent 3: item 6 (next highest valuation)

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: items 0, 5
- Agent 1: item 3
- Agent 2: item 2
- Agent 3: items 4, 6
- Agent 4: item 1

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated, while trying to respect the valuations as much as possible.
