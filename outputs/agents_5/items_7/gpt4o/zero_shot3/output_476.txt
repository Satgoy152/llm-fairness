Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  76  61   2  44  15  74
1  84   4  32  54  47  68  14
2  81  72  17  58  26  27  22
3  78   2  18  79  17  95   7
4  12  43  34  96   6  91  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's consider maximizing the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here are the steps for allocation:

1. **Initial assignment**: Based on the highest value each agent has for any available item, initially allocate items to agents.
2. **Adjust for fairness**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and adjust allocations to balance the total value fairly.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 76.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest at 84.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 81.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 95.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the highest at 96.

Let's assign the items based on these initial high values and make adjustments as needed:

### Allocations:
- **Agent 0**: [1] (value = 76)
- **Agent 1**: [0] (value = 84)
- **Agent 2**: [6] (value = 22)
- **Agent 3**: [5, 3] (value = 95 + 79 = 174)
- **Agent 4**: [4, 2] (value = 6 + 34 = 40)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and distributes all items fairly based on maximum values for high-priority items.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```
This allocation ensures all items are assigned, and each agent has items based on their highest valuations while keeping the distribution fair.
