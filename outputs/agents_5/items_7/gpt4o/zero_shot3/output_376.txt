Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43   7  66  35  37  87  21
1  83  56  87  89   8  18  18
2  37  80  94  34  34  91  59
3  86  58  66  21  89  74   6
4  15  22  96  81  45  53  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's preferences are taken into account as much as possible. Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 1** has high valuations for item 3 (89) and item 2 (87). 
2. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2 (94) but since Agent 1 has already taken item 3, we assign item 5 (91) to Agent 2 as it is the next highest.
3. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 4 (89).
4. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 5 (87), but since it's taken, we assign item 2 (66).
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 2 (96), but since it's taken, we assign item 6 (62) which is the next highest available.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated by checking the remaining unallocated items:

- Item 0 and item 1 are unallocated.

Let's allocate these remaining items:
- **Agent 0** can take item 0 (43).
- **Agent 3** can take item 1 (58).

Now, all items have been allocated. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 1],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.
