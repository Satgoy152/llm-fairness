Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  94  70  36  45  62  93
1  45  59  15  62  89  40  79
2  16  42  45  43  73  55  82
3  70  11  39   7  18   7  88
4  95   7  49  39  14  79  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. One common method is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that no agent gets more than a reasonable share of items. Given that we have 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others.

Let's proceed with a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We have 5 agents and 7 items, meaning some agents will receive 1 item while others may receive 2.
   - The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent's share is as fair as possible.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.
   - Ensure no agent receives more items than necessary unless unavoidable.

3. **Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most (95). Assign to Agent 4.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (94). Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (70). Assign to Agent 0.
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (62). Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (89). Assign to Agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most (79). Assign to Agent 4.
   - Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most (88). Assign to Agent 3.

4. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items 1 and 2.
   - Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4.
   - Agent 2 receives no items.
   - Agent 3 receives item 6.
   - Agent 4 receives items 0 and 5.

Following this strategy, here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```
