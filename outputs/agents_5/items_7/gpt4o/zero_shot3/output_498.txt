Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  26   6  29  79  59  50
1  10  82  38  29  83   0  91
2  49   8  61  79   4  54   8
3  91  21  89  24   1  77  83
4  24  89  80  21  18  42  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction by assigning them items with the highest value for them, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's start by analyzing the values and making allocations:

1. Agent 0 values items: 
   - Item 0: 59
   - Item 4: 79 (highest value for agent 0)
   - Assign item 4 to agent 0.

2. Agent 1 values items:
   - Item 6: 91 (highest value for agent 1)
   - Assign item 6 to agent 1.

3. Agent 2 values items:
   - Item 3: 79 (highest value for agent 2)
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2.

4. Agent 3 values items:
   - Item 0: 91 (highest value for agent 3)
   - Assign item 0 to agent 3.

5. Agent 4 values items:
   - Item 1: 89 (highest value for agent 4)
   - Assign item 1 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (items 2 and 5).

6. Allocate remaining items considering next highest values:
   - Item 2:
     - Agent 3 values item 2 at 89 (highest remaining value for item 2)
     - Assign item 2 to agent 3.

   - Item 5:
     - Agent 3 values item 5 at 77 (highest remaining value for item 5)
     - Assign item 5 to agent 3.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 2, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
