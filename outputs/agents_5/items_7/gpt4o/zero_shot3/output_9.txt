Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13   2  58  69  13  79  79
1  30  50  36  47  77  68  92
2  61  98  52  83  28  20  76
3  54  38  67  63  26  45  63
4  76  95  83   9   7  71  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5 and 6 (both 79). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 6 (92). Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (98). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2 (67). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0 (76). Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
   - Agent 4 also has a high valuation for item 4 (7), and since there are no other agents with high preference for this item, allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Remaining item (3)**:
   - Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (83). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

Now we have allocated all 7 items. Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
