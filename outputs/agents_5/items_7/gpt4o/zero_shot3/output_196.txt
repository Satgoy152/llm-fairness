Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  95  45  62  32  52  66
1  58  64   0  73   7  36  47
2  73  22   1  46  57  27   8
3  99  53  45  13  95  84  64
4  46  71  81  87  91  64  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We'll begin by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 1 (Value: 95)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 3 (Value: 73)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 0 (Value: 73)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 5 (Value: 84)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 4 (Value: 91)

This consumes 5 items, leaving 2 more items to allocate. For the remaining items, we will consider the next highest value:

6. **Agent 3**: Item 6 (Value: 64)
7. **Agent 4**: Item 2 (Value: 81)

All items are now allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation based on the highest values they assign to the items, while ensuring that each item is allocated.
