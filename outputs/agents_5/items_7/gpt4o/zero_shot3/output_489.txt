Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  88   0  13  61  75  97
1  15  13  53  80   1  72  42
2  47  40  38  89  39  64  78
3  62  84  81  23  86  97  51
4  29   7  82  10  59  85  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items based on their valuations such that each agent receives the items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item whenever possible. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 the highest (97), followed by item 0 (94).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (80), followed by item 2 (53).
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest (89), followed by item 6 (78).
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest (97), followed by item 4 (86).
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 the highest (92), followed by item 5 (85).

Now, let's allocate the items fairly:

- Item 0 (94) goes to Agent 0.
- Item 1 (88) goes to Agent 0 since it's their second highest value.
- Item 2 (53) goes to Agent 1.
- Item 3 (89) goes to Agent 2, as it's their highest value.
- Item 4 (86) goes to Agent 3.
- Item 5 (97) goes to Agent 3, as it's their highest value.
- Item 6 (92) goes to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that items are distributed based on high preferences, while each agent receives their top or one of their top choices.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [6]
}
```
