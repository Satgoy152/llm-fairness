Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  47  38  68   2  32  76
1  59  19  82  35  12  12   0
2  58  94  55  38  52  14  25
3  55  72   3  75  37  94  19
4  80  82  22  34  67  39  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple method to maximize the total value each agent receives. This is not necessarily the only or optimal way to allocate, but it is one approach to ensure each item is assigned to an agent who values it highly.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated equals 7 and that no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most at 80.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 94.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 82.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 75.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most at 67.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most at 94.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 76.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated to agents who value them highly, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
