Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  18  90   8  86  82   0
1  10  44  89  90  97  14  17
2  26  63  82  72  46  52  25
3  43  51  49  58  14  21  88
4  96  18   4  34  48  76  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and try to balance the allocation based on these valuations.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and no items are left unallocated.

Let's start by analyzing the table and assigning items:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 4.
- Agent 2 has a relatively balanced valuation but can take item 1.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 6.
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 0.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items, aiming for a fair distribution:

- After allocating the highest values, Agent 0 can also take item 5, which they also value highly.
- Agent 1 can take item 3 as it is their second-highest valuation.
- Agent 2 can take item 1 as they have a high valuation for it.
- Agent 3 can take item 6.
- Agent 4 receives item 0.

Here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value highly, aiming for a fair distribution.
