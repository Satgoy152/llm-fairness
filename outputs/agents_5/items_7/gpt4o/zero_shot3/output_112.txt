Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  12  11   3  44  50  42
1  58  37   2  99  51   3  65
2  69  54  10  15  14  57  27
3   3  23  55  20  10  78  19
4  37   6  96   6  71  19  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 12 11  3 44 50 42]
 [58 37  2 99 51  3 65]
 [69 54 10 15 14 57 27]
 [ 3 23 55 20 10 78 19]
 [37  6 96  6 71 19 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated to one agent and each agent can receive an integer number of items.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [11, 12, 11, 3, 44, 50, 42]
Agent 1: [58, 37, 2, 99, 51, 3, 65]
Agent 2: [69, 54, 10, 15, 14, 57, 27]
Agent 3: [3, 23, 55, 20, 10, 78, 19]
Agent 4: [37, 6, 96, 6, 71, 19, 33]
```

A potential allocation strategy could be:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 as they value it the highest (99).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 as they value it the highest (78).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 4 as they value it the highest (71).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 4 as they value it the highest (96).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 as they value it the highest (54).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 as they value it the highest (42).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 as they value it the highest (58).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and we maximize the satisfaction for each item based on the highest valuation. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation meets the requirements of distributing exactly 7 items among the agents based on the given valuations, while each agent receives an integer number of items.
