Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  62  48  79  96  86  56
1  68  20  54  66  50  87  54
2  40   1   1  53  77  57  39
3  92  56  50  96  42  53  76
4  56  26  88  67  69  33   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, let's aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. This problem can resemble a version of the assignment problem, where we try to maximize the overall utility.

Let's start by assigning items based on maximizing each agent's highest value:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest (96).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the highest (87).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest (77), but since item 4 is already taken, the next highest is item 5 (57), which is also taken. Item 3 (53) is the next available.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the highest (96), but since item 3 is already taken, the next highest is item 0 (92).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the highest (88).

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- Item 1 is left unassigned, and Agent 0 values it at 62, which is their second highest available. 
- Item 6 is also unassigned, Agent 3 values it at 76, which is their second highest available.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 1
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 0, 6
- Agent 4: Item 2

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [2]
}
```
