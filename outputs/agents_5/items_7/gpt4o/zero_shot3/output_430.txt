Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  55  54  77  52  23  55
1  15  82  22  10  55  16  95
2  50  25  61  45  95  41   8
3  59   4  97  28  84  34  15
4   6  47   8  66  13  65  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents by considering their valuations. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations per item while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations on items: 3 (77), 0 (60), and 1 (55).
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 (95) the most.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (95).
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 (97) the most.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 (66) highly.

Now, let's allocate based on these considerations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (60)
- **Agent 1**: Item 6 (95)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (95)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (97)
- **Agent 4**: Item 3 (66)

Items remaining (not yet allocated): 1, 5

For the remaining items, let's allocate them to the agents who have only received one item and maximize their additional satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: Can also highly value item 1 (55)
- **Agent 4**: Can take item 5 (65)

With this allocation, all items are assigned and each agent has at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, considering their highest preferences and ensuring each agent has at least one item.
