Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  90  54  77  25  15  43
1  81  23  96  98  68  98  12
2  26  60  11  69  35  86  44
3  96  40  25  11  68  44  48
4  25  87  27  39  99  29   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. We will ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the values each agent has for the items and try to make an allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - 0: 40
   - 1: 90 (highest for this agent)
   - 2: 54
   - 3: 77
   - 4: 25
   - 5: 15
   - 6: 43

2. **Agent 1** values:
   - 0: 81
   - 1: 23
   - 2: 96 (highest for this agent)
   - 3: 98 (highest for this agent)
   - 4: 68
   - 5: 98 (highest for this agent)
   - 6: 12

3. **Agent 2** values:
   - 0: 26
   - 1: 60
   - 2: 11
   - 3: 69
   - 4: 35
   - 5: 86 (highest for this agent)
   - 6: 44

4. **Agent 3** values:
   - 0: 96 (highest for this agent)
   - 1: 40
   - 2: 25
   - 3: 11
   - 4: 68
   - 5: 44
   - 6: 48

5. **Agent 4** values:
   - 0: 25
   - 1: 87
   - 2: 27
   - 3: 39
   - 4: 99 (highest for this agent)
   - 5: 29
   - 6: 4

Considering both the highest preference and trying to ensure each agent gets at least one item, a potential allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (high value)
- Agent 1: Item 3 and Item 2 (high values)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (high value)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (high value)
- Agent 4: Item 4 and Item 6 (high value)

This allocation results in each agent receiving at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
