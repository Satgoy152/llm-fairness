Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18   2  95  49  98  60  44
1  25  97  52  16   1  61  42
2  52  84  49  28   8   2  43
3  46  10  20   5  58  35  81
4  80  69  23  16  63  77  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the agents' valuations and tries to maximize the overall happiness or efficiency of the allocation. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item wherever possible. 

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Values: [18, 25, 52, 46, 80]
   - Assigned to Agent 4 (value = 80)

2. **Item 1:**
   - Values: [2, 97, 84, 10, 69]
   - Assigned to Agent 1 (value = 97)

3. **Item 2:**
   - Values: [95, 52, 49, 20, 23]
   - Assigned to Agent 0 (value = 95)

4. **Item 3:**
   - Values: [49, 16, 28, 5, 16]
   - Assigned to Agent 0 (value = 49)

5. **Item 4:**
   - Values: [98, 1, 8, 58, 63]
   - Assigned to Agent 0 (value = 98)

6. **Item 5:**
   - Values: [60, 61, 2, 35, 77]
   - Assigned to Agent 4 (value = 77)

7. **Item 6:**
   - Values: [44, 42, 43, 81, 81]
   - Assigned to Agent 3 (value = 81)

The allocation is such that each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most. Let's verify that each agent gets a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 3, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: No items assigned
- Agent 3: Item [6]
- Agent 4: Items [0, 5]

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```
