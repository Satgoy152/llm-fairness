Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  11  30  36   8  11   6
1   6  20  91  18  41  53  99
2   5  65  75  13  92  25   9
3   4  32  34  91  12  15  45
4  30  98  84  21  98  77  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents according to their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. This problem is similar to the "assignment problem," which is a type of combinatorial optimization problem.

Let's follow these steps to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest bidder for each item**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

2. **Adjust for fairness**: If an agent would not get any items, make sure they receive at least one item by reallocating an item from an agent who has multiple items.

Given the valuations, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Valuations are [2, 6, 5, 4, 30]. Agent 4 values it the most.
- **Item 1**: Valuations are [11, 20, 65, 32, 98]. Agent 4 values it the most.
- **Item 2**: Valuations are [30, 91, 75, 34, 84]. Agent 1 values it the most.
- **Item 3**: Valuations are [36, 18, 13, 91, 21]. Agent 3 values it the most.
- **Item 4**: Valuations are [8, 41, 92, 12, 98]. Agent 4 values it the most.
- **Item 5**: Valuations are [11, 53, 25, 15, 77]. Agent 4 values it the most.
- **Item 6**: Valuations are [6, 99, 9, 45, 86]. Agent 1 values it the most.

Initial allocation:
- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [2, 6]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [0, 1, 4, 5]

Adjusting for fairness, we notice Agent 0 and Agent 2 have no items. We will reallocate items to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Transfer Item 0 from Agent 4 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 values it second highest after Agent 4).
- Transfer Item 5 from Agent 4 to Agent 2 (as Agent 2 values it second highest after Agent 4).

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2, 6]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1, 4]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
