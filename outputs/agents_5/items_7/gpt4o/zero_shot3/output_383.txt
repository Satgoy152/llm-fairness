Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  36  18  33  20  65  95
1  84   3  73  21  56  90  88
2  73  21  42  55  59  20   9
3  70  91  79  70  81  25   0
4   9  45  40  58  44  44  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We will consider each agent's highest-valued items and attempt to distribute them in a way that is as equitable as possible. 

Here's a step-by-step approach to determine the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued item for Agent 0 is item 0, with a value of 96. We'll allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest-valued item for Agent 1 is item 5, with a value of 90. We'll allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest-valued item for Agent 2 is item 4, with a value of 59. We'll allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest-valued item for Agent 3 is item 1, with a value of 91. We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest-valued item for Agent 4 is item 3, with a value of 58. We'll allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

At this point, each agent has been assigned one item. We have allocated 5 items so far, so we have 2 more items to allocate.

Continuing with the next highest values for unmet items:

6. **Remaining Items**: Items 2 and 6 are left unallocated. 
   - Item 2 has high values for Agent 3 (79) and Agent 1 (73). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 3, as it has the highest value.
   - Item 6 has high values for Agent 0 (95) and Agent 1 (88). Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value.

Now, each agent has been assigned at least one item and we have allocated all 7 items.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [3]
}
```
