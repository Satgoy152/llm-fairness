Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  47  96  20  48  89  83
1  82  44  11  98  74  28  59
2  92  20   1  70  20  75  48
3  12  50  97  11  39   6  54
4  94  12  56  52   6  16  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the process can look:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 4 values it the highest at 94.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 4.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 47.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 0.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 97.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 3.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 98.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 74.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 89.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 0.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 83.
   - Assign item 6 to agent 0.

Now that each item is allocated, here are the assignments in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives items 1, 5, and 6, Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4, Agent 3 receives item 2, and Agent 4 receives item 0. Agent 2 receives no items.
