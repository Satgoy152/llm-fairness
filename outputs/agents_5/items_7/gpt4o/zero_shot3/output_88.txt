Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  25  79  50  98  56  76
1  93  94  97  73  54  84  16
2  69  13   3  81  20  98  83
3  75   5  33   4  88  40  62
4  50  57  37  53   7  32   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others. A reasonable approach could be to allocate items based on the highest individual valuations first, then balance the allocations ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the valuations and perform a fair allocation:

1. Assign item 4 (value 98) to agent 0 because it's the highest value for agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 (value 97) to agent 1 because it's the highest value for agent 1.
3. Assign item 5 (value 98) to agent 2 because it's the highest value for agent 2.
4. Assign item 6 (value 62) to agent 3 because it's the highest value for agent 3.
5. Assign item 1 (value 57) to agent 4 because it's the highest value for agent 4.

Now, each agent has at least one item. We have 2 items left (items 0 and 3) to allocate:

6. Assign item 0 (value 93) to agent 1 because it maximizes value (next highest for any agent).
7. Assign item 3 (value 81) to agent 2 because it maximizes value (next highest for any agent).

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This results in a fair distribution where each agent receives at least one item, and the total value assigned is maximized based on the given valuations.
