Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  28  28  43  34  79  40
1   1  55  86  17  68  74  34
2  92   7  55  98  37  81  22
3   8  12  80  12  94  32  29
4  24  60  60  95   1  71  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring that all items are allocated. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, but given that some agents may end up with more items than others, care must be taken to balance the distribution.

Let's analyze the allocations based on maximizing individual values:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 92.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 60.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 86.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 98.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 94.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 81.

7. Item 6:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 40.

Now, we will allocate the items based on the above analysis while making sure each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3, 5
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 1

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
