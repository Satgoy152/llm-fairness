Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64   0  91  61  73  90  37
1  54  19  43  58  64  85  39
2   3  66  31  58  72  13  69
3  41  48  83  10   0   5  37
4  55  14  31  97  92  53  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One possible approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items.

Here's one way to fairly allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest (64).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest (66).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it the highest (83).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it the highest (97).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it the second highest (92).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest (90).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest (69).

Now, each agent has received at least one item, and all items have been allocated. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
