Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  56  50   4  82  66  74
1  23  42  98  55  88  21  89
2  15  59  14  61  40  76  82
3  39  92  32  18  16  49  43
4  47  94  92  74  97  97  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest among all agents.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest among all agents.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest among all agents.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest among all agents.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest among all agents.

After these allocations, we have one item left, which is item 6. We can assign it to the agent who values it the most among the remaining unallocated items, which is agent 1.

Based on this reasoning, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
