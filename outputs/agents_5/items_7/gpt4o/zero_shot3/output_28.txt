Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  51  20  47   3  10  78
1  93  57  39  17  77  18  31
2  95  15  96  91  73  85  51
3  33  56  69  57  57  79   0
4  66   7  89  37  41  19  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agentâ€™s valuation of the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes or at least fairly balances the total value each agent receives. 

Let's go through the allocation step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 6 the highest (78). Let's allocate item 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 the highest (93). Let's allocate item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 the highest (96). Let's allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5 the highest (79). Let's allocate item 5 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 2 the highest (89), but item 2 is already allocated. The next highest valued item is 0 (66), but it is also allocated. The next highest valued item is 3 (37). Let's allocate item 3 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items while considering the remaining available items (1 and 4) and the fair distribution among agents.

6. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 1 (56) and item 4 (57). Let's allocate item 4 to agent 3 since it has a higher value for this agent.

7. **Agent 1**: Among the remaining items, agent 1 values item 1 the highest (57). Let's allocate item 1 to agent 1.

Now all 7 items are allocated. Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
