Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  42  30  66  38  15  22
1  90  42  88  84  47  74  23
2   8  96  21  96  16  97  10
3  87  85  13  30  57   7  76
4  19  74  48  97  46   5  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the agents' valuations of the items and attempt to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction for all agents. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Agent 0 has relatively high valuations on item 3 (66) and item 1 (42). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 (88) and item 0 (90) highly. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 (96) and item 5 (97) highly. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation on item 0 (87) and item 6 (76). Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 (97) highly. Since item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, let's allocate item 4 (46) to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 4, and 0). Let's consider the next best items for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 1 remains a good option.
- Agent 1: Item 0 is still appealing.
- Agent 2: Item 4 is the next best option.
- Agent 3: Already has item 6, but could consider item 0.
- Agent 4: Item 1 could be the next option.

Let's finalize allocations:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

This is one of the ways to allocate items fairly, considering the valuations given. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
