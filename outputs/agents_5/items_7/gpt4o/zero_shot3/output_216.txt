Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  73  60  67  82  97  72
1  54  37  89  98  38  41  98
2  34  87  87  70  59  21  29
3  40  58   9  90  45  11   1
4  57  23  69  52   6  17   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[63 73 60 67 82 97 72]
 [54 37 89 98 38 41 98]
 [34 87 87 70 59 21 29]
 [40 58  9 90 45 11  1]
 [57 23 69 52  6 17  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that reflects their valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 5 (97), so we assign item 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (98), and item 6 (98), so we assign items 3 and 6 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 1 (87) and 2 (87), so we assign items 1 and 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (40), so we assign item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a moderate valuation for item 4 (6), so we assign item 4 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all the items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
