Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  69  17  30  58  60  43
1   6  91  64   1  55  98   6
2  34  67  56  42  44  44  90
3  68  87  41  53  63  85  83
4  68   1  79  96  76   1  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an equitable distribution based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a strategy like maximizing the minimum valuation each agent receives. Let's try to distribute the items in a way that seems fair given the table of valuations:

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each agent's minimum satisfaction:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 5, so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 4** highly values item 3, so allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
3. **Agent 3** highly values item 1, so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 2** highly values item 6, so allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 0** values item 4 the most, so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** also values item 2 highly, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 3** values item 0 highly, so allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to provide each agent with items they value highly, ensuring a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
