Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  73  84  22  46  38  69
1  76  83  60  37  58  72  74
2  88  46  73  57  31  37  12
3  87  57  57   3  85  57  23
4  73  57  49  15  44  46  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated. This problem can be approached using a preference-based allocation method.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest valued item for each agent and allocate it to them, if not already allocated.
2. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

- **Agent 0:** Highest value for item 2 (84).
- **Agent 1:** Highest value for item 1 (83).
- **Agent 2:** Highest value for item 0 (88).
- **Agent 3:** Highest value for item 0 (87), but item 0 is already taken. Next highest: item 4 (85).
- **Agent 4:** Highest value for item 0 (73), but item 0 is already taken. Next highest: item 5 (46).

At this point, all agents have at least one item, but there are still unallocated items. We need to assign the remaining items:

- Unallocated items: 3 and 6.

Let's assign these remaining items based on the next highest preferences:

- **Item 3:** Highest remaining preference is Agent 0 (22), but not very high. Instead, assign to Agent 4 (15) for balance.
- **Item 6:** Assign to Agent 1 (74) as their next highest preference.

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 3]
}
```

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item (except Agent 0), and preferences are maximized within the constraints.
