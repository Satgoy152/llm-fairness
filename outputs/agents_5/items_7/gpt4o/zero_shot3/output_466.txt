Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  14  52  20  44  13  39
1  82  90  74  99  39  83  18
2  20  22  80  76  90  67  22
3  23  24  50  98  95  67  58
4  22   1  72  55  20   3  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Below is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highly at 52, so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for item 3 at 99 and item 1 at 90. We allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highly at 90, so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5 at 67, so we allocate item 5 to agent 3.
5. Agent 3 also values item 3 but item 3 is already allocated. Agent 3's next highest valuation is item 4 which is already allocated. Therefore, we allocate item 6 to agent 3 as it has a valuation of 58.
6. Agent 1 also values item 1 highly at 90, which is not yet allocated, so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
7. Finally, Agent 0 can receive item 0 since their next highest valuation is 46 for item 0.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": []
}
```

This ensures all 7 items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair allocation based on their valuations.
