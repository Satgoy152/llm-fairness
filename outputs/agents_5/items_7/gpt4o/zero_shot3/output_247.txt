Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  20  73  12  20   0  14
1  26  82   8  59  61  20  93
2  76  35  53  30   3  38  79
3  90  46  83  49  94  11  93
4  57   9  54  18  48  98  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total value, and the total number of items allocated is equal to the number of items available.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items:

- Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.
- Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, distributing any remaining items to balance the allocations.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Valued highest by agent 3 (90).
2. Item 1: Valued highest by agent 1 (82).
3. Item 2: Valued highest by agent 3 (83).
4. Item 3: Valued highest by agent 1 (59).
5. Item 4: Valued highest by agent 3 (94).
6. Item 5: Valued highest by agent 4 (98).
7. Item 6: Valued highest by agent 1 (93).

Let's adjust to ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0 receives item 0 (value 47).
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3 (values 82 and 59).
- Agent 2 receives item 6 (value 79).
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 4 (values 83 and 94).
- Agent 4 receives item 5 (value 98).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```
