Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  61  46   5  33  73  83
1  92   6  81  63  59  65  55
2  70  66  93  96  57  55  17
3  76  33  31  16  27  78  61
4  51  11  21  80  69  40  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[39 61 46  5 33 73 83]
 [92  6 81 63 59 65 55]
 [70 66 93 96 57 55 17]
 [76 33 31 16 27 78 61]
 [51 11 21 80 69 40 78]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the constraints and the valuations, we can use a heuristic approach to distribute the items.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 6 and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 3, but it's already allocated to Agent 2, so next highest is item 6.

Analyzing the table, an allocation that attempts to maximize agents' valuations could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6 (value 83), Item 5 (value 73)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 92)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (value 96)
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value 33)
- **Agent 4**: Item 4 (value 69), Item 2 (value 21)

This allocation distributes all 7 items, giving each agent at least one item based on their highest valuation without conflicts.

Now, I'll present the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
