Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  40  16   9  40  86  22
1  85  56  51  61  78  75  91
2  35  50  33  96  37  37  98
3  47  11  91  50  12  12  87
4  62  10  42  35  98  58  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 50 33 96 37 37 98]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation:

1. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values item 6 the most at 98.
2. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values item 5 the most at 86.
3. **Item 4**: Agent 4 values item 4 the most at 98.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 96.
5. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values item 2 the most at 91.
6. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 56.
7. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 85.

Now, let's ensure that we allocate all items fairly across all agents:

- Agent 0 will get item 5.
- Agent 1 will get items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 will get items 3 and 6.
- Agent 3 will get item 2.
- Agent 4 will get item 4.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
