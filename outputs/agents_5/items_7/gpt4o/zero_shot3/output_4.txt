Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  16  23  97  63  36  44
1  27  33  43  80  11  41  27
2  13  42  50  69  64  54  12
3  79  17  38  82  11  84  20
4  41  76  70  88  97  58  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and the total number of allocated items equals 7.

Let's examine a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 3 (97), Item 0 (91)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuation: Item 2 (43)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuation: Item 5 (54)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuation: Item 5 (84), Item 3 (82)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - High valuations: Item 4 (97), Item 6 (94)
   - Allocate Items 0 and 4 to Agent 4

Now let's ensure all items are allocated:

- Item 0: Allocated to Agent 4
- Item 1: Allocate to Agent 1 (Next highest available, value 33)
- Item 2: Allocated to Agent 1
- Item 3: Allocated to Agent 0
- Item 4: Allocated to Agent 4
- Item 5: Allocated to Agent 2
- Item 6: Allocated to Agent 3

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
