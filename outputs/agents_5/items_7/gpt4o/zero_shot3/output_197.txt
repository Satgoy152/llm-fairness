Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  91  93  41  20   7  65
1  31   3  43  57  23  67  65
2  30  64  94  21  26  51  65
3  65  25  79   9  11  96  86
4  90  61  87  75  95  10  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [90 61 87 75 95 10 51]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their satisfaction, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 2 (93)
   - Allocation: [2]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 5 (67)
   - Allocation: [5]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 2 (94), but already taken by Agent 0
   - Next highest valuation for item 1 (64)
   - Allocation: [1]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 5 (96), but already taken by Agent 1
   - Next highest valuation for item 6 (86)
   - Allocation: [6]

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuation for item 4 (95)
   - Allocation: [4]

Now, we still need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 3:

- **Agent 0** has a remaining preference for item 1 (91), but already taken; next is item 0 (0), which is the least valuable. We'll pass for now.
- **Agent 1**, **Agent 2**, **Agent 3**, and **Agent 4** have already received one item each, so we aim to distribute the remaining items to maintain fairness.

Let's allocate based on remaining preferences:

- **Agent 0** gets item 0 (value 0), as it has the least contention and was not highly valued elsewhere.
- **Agent 4** gets item 3 (value 75), their next highest remaining valued item.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed based on the valuations given.
