Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  72  63  54  95  24  34
1  16  47  93  89  45  44  66
2  28  23  75  88  96  19  75
3  16  24  28   7  33  38  35
4   8  69  31  72  16  27  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation maximizes the total valuation. A commonly used approach for such problems is the "Greedy" method, where items are allocated iteratively based on the highest value an unallocated item has for any agent.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Consider the highest value each agent has for the remaining unallocated items.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Repeat until all items are allocated.

Applying this method to the given table:

1. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 2 (96).
2. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 1 (93).
3. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 2 (88).
4. Item 6 has the highest value for Agent 4 (96).
5. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0 (72).
6. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2 (28).
7. Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 3 (38).

After allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 gets Item 1
- Agent 1 gets Item 2
- Agent 2 gets Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 3 gets Item 5
- Agent 4 gets Item 6

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 3, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6]
}
```
