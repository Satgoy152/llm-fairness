Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  54  46  96  55   8   0
1  70  46  40   5  76  11  51
2  54  75  34  13  76  16  30
3  88   1  45   1  42  46  96
4  71  74  78  39  43  73  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that the preferences (valuations) of the agents are considered, and each agent gets an integer number of items. We need to allocate all 7 items among the 5 agents.

Here is one way to allocate the items considering the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (96), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (70), so we allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (75), so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (96), so we allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (78), so we allocate item 2 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items:

6. The remaining items are 4 and 5. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4 (76), so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.
7. Item 5 has a relatively high valuation for agent 4 (73), so we allocate item 5 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, and all 7 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```
