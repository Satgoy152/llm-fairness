Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  49  73   6  11  65  72
1  64  80  17  48  25  82   2
2  44  13  22  26  51  76  32
3  64  41   8  64  27  44  22
4  17  99  37  86  78  13  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [64 80 17 48 25 82  2]
 [44 13 22 26 51 76 32]

 [17 99 37 86 78 13 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a share of items that reflect their valuations. One approach to achieve this is by maximizing the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent gets a fair allocation.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 0 (value 55) and item 2 (value 73).
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 5 (value 82).
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 4 (value 51).
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 3 (value 64).
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 1 (value 99) and item 6 (value 72).

This allocation considers maximizing the total value each agent receives, given their specific valuations.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```
