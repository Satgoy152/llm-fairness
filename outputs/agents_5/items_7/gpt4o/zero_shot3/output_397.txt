Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  91  58  52  54  33  91
1  81  39   5  82  13  82  92
2  76   9  15  65   3  45  88
3  65  70  33  48  59  30   7
4  57  37  74  31  84  36  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. A potential approach is to assign items to agents who value them the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 91.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 6 with a value of 92.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 0 with a value of 76.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 3 is item 1, but it's already assigned.
   - Next highest value is item 4 with a value of 59.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest value item for Agent 4 is item 4, but it's already assigned.
   - Next highest value is item 6, but it's already assigned.
   - Next highest value is item 2 with a value of 74.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, each agent has at least one item. Distribute the remaining items (3 and 5) to maximize valuations:

- **Item 3:**
  - Highest value for item 3 is by Agent 1 with a value of 82, but Agent 1 already has item 6.
  - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (since it maximizes their overall satisfaction).

- **Item 5:**
  - Highest value for item 5 is by Agent 1 with a value of 82, but Agent 1 already has two items.
  - Next highest value is item 5 by Agent 2 with a value of 45.
  - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
