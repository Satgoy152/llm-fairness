Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56   0  80  19  43  31  34
1  27  52  93  22  11  90  21
2  73  87   6  26  11  74  91
3  48  14  43  57  28  64   2
4  90  72  92  56  74  36  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuation of the items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that the total allocation includes all 7 items. One way to approach this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Assign items to the agent with the highest valuation for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 4 values it the highest (90).
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest (87).
   - Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest (93).
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values it the highest (57).
   - Item 4: Agent 4 values it the highest (74).
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the highest (90).
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it the highest (91).

2. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item:**
   - Agent 0 currently has no items. We will reallocate one item from an agent that has more than one item or reassign one from an agent with lower overall value.
   - Agent 1 has items 2 and 5. We can reassign item 2 to Agent 0 since Agent 0 values item 2 higher than any other available item.

3. **Reassign item 2 to Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 now has item 2.
   - Agent 1 retains item 5.

Now, all agents have at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
