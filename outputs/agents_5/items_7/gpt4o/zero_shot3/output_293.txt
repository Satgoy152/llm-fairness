Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   4   1  33  58  72  26  98
1  65  64  55  54  27  77  95
2  90  75  57  30  77  58  94
3  35   8   9  88  96  57  95
4  30  61  23  10  28  47  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to distribute the items so that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuation for item 6 (98), so allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuation for item 0 (65), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuation for item 2 (57) and item 4 (77), so allocate items 2 and 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuation for item 3 (88) and item 5 (57), so allocate items 3 and 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - No items allocated yet, so assign the remaining item 1 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated. The allocation is made by considering the highest valuations to balance the distribution.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
