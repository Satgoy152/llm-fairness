Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  31  36  32  92  63  73
1  68  79  44  56  53  92   6
2  15  39  15  91   6  82  86
3   0  86  26  33  99  47  34
4  19  25  81  83  69  17  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and each item is given to exactly one agent. One common method to achieve fairness is to maximize the minimum valuation each agent receives.

Here's one possible allocation that tries to balance the allocations based on the agents' valuations:

1. Agent 0 has relatively high values for items 4 and 6.
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 5.
3. Agent 2 has a high value for item 3.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly, but item 4 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we look for the next best option.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 most highly.

Following these observations, we can allocate items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 6.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.
- Agent 4 gets item 2.

This leaves us with items 0 and 1. We can allocate them to the agents as follows, without violating fairness too much:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (as they have a decent valuation for it).
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (as they have a high valuation for it).

The JSON format for the allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.
