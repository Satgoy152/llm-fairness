Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  44  93  64  70  21  73
1  90  84  59  79  47  19  33
2  59  55  13  32  86  15  48
3  63  84  19  82  36  17  54
4  41  17  33  79  81  58  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes total satisfaction or value across all agents. One common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can do it:

1. For each item, identify which agent values it the most.
2. Assign that item to the identified agent.
3. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's apply this approach to the given table:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 90.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 84.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 93.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 64.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 86.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 58.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 73.

Allocations based on the highest value for each item:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Item 5

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items.
