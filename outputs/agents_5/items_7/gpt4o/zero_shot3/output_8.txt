Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  89  18  76  53  95  11
1  65  11  80  15  62  29  38
2   6  68  77  56  61   8  94
3  90  82  52  92  70  87  76
4  34  46   7  20  94  42  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations - [19, 89, 18, 76, 53, 95, 11]
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (95)
   - Allocation: [5]

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations - [65, 11, 80, 15, 62, 29, 38]
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (80)
   - Allocation: [2]

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations - [6, 68, 77, 56, 61, 8, 94]
   - Highest valuation: Item 6 (94)
   - Allocation: [6]

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations - [90, 82, 52, 92, 70, 87, 76]
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (92)
   - Allocation: [3]

5. **Agent 4**: Valuations - [34, 46, 7, 20, 94, 42, 42]
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (94)
   - Allocation: [4]

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (0 and 1):

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (90)
  - Agent 3: [3, 0]

- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (89)
  - Agent 0: [5, 1]

This allocation results in:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item based on their highest valuations.
