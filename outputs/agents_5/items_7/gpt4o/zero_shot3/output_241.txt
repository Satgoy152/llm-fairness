Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  90  23  12  11  31   8
1  96  17   4  25  44  10  67
2  19  57   4  27  91  43  21
3  93  97  13  55  19  60  29
4  13  23  48  55  81  38  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's consider the valuations provided and find an optimal distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for item 1 (90) and item 0 (85).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for item 0 (96) and item 6 (67).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for item 4 (91) and item 1 (57).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for item 1 (97) and item 0 (93).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for item 4 (81) and item 3 (55).

Given the constraints, let's try to assign items based on the highest preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (90).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 6 (67).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (91).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 0 (93).
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 3 (55).

Now, we have two unallocated items, 2 and 5. Let's assign them based on next highest preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (23).
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 5 (38).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```
