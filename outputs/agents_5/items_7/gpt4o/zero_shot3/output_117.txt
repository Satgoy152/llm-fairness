Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  10  92  70   8  72  94
1  61  73  58  16  87  84  35
2  27  21  15  14   3  19  67
3  66  65  59  88  57  79  98
4  59  13  27  36  55   8  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we could consider maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 5 agents and 7 items, at least two agents will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each. Let's follow this approach to allocate:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value: Item 6 (94)
   - Second highest: Item 2 (92)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 4 (87)
   - Second highest: Item 5 (84)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 6 (67)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (27)
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: Item 6 (98)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (88)
   
5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (59)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (55)

Considering the constraint of a total of 7 items to be allocated:

- Assign items based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
- If an item is a top choice for multiple agents, allocate the item to the agent with fewer total valuations or distribute based on fairness.

After examining the valuations, a possible allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 4, Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 0, Item 1

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 7.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
  "0": [2],
  "1": [4, 5],
  "2": [6],
  "3": [3],
  "4": [0, 1]
}
```
