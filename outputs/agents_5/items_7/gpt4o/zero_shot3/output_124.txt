Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  37  17   7  27  14  20
1  91  54  21   4  31  34  27
2  39  60   6  22  70   3  20
3  44  13  33   3  88   5   8
4  12  80  84  67  70  90  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item (or none if necessary), all items are allocated, and the allocation tries to maximize each agent's total value. Here's one way to approach it:

1. **Agent 0**: Items with the highest values are 0 (57) and 1 (37).
2. **Agent 1**: Items with the highest values are 0 (91) and 1 (54), but 0 is already allocated to Agent 0, so choose item 1 (54) and 5 (34).
3. **Agent 2**: Items with the highest values are 4 (70) and 1 (60), but 1 is already allocated, so choose item 4 (70).
4. **Agent 3**: Items with the highest values are 4 (88), but 4 is already allocated, so choose item 2 (33).
5. **Agent 4**: Items with the highest values are 5 (90) and 2 (84), but 2 is already allocated, so choose item 5 (90) and 6 (32).

By following this strategy, we try to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly while ensuring no overlap in items and that all items are allocated.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and the agents receive items based on their value preferences to the extent possible.
