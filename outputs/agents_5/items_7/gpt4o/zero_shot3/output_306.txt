Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  29   0  62  90  65  62
1  53  65  91  27  79  56  24
2  48   0  22  11  56  27  86
3  54  25  19  85   6   2  67
4  61  61  22   4  90  20  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can approach this problem by trying to maximize the total value of items assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are distributed.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values items: 
   - Highest: 92 (item 0), 90 (item 4)
   - Others: 65 (item 5), 62 (items 3 and 6)

2. **Agent 1** values items:
   - Highest: 91 (item 2)
   - Others: 79 (item 4), 65 (item 1)

3. **Agent 2** values items:
   - Highest: 86 (item 6)
   - Others: 56 (item 4)

4. **Agent 3** values items:
   - Highest: 85 (item 3)
   - Others: 67 (item 6), 54 (item 0)

5. **Agent 4** values items:
   - Highest: 90 (item 4)
   - Others: 61 (items 0, 1, and 6)

A fair distribution would aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible and all items are allocated. A possible allocation strategy is:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for Agent 0)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (high valuation for both Agent 0 and Agent 4, but Agent 4 has fewer high-value options)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for Agent 1)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for Agent 3)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation for Agent 0)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation for Agent 1)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for Agent 2)

This allocation gives each agent a good or highest-value item they prefer while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
