Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  58  65  91  18  85  40
1  10  13  11  73  88  84  38
2  70  40  51  27  41  25  81
3  34   6  62  54  16   6  78
4  50  73  59  40  44  31   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to give each agent at least one item if possible, and we should consider the valuations to ensure a fair distribution based on their preferences. Given that there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more than one item. Let's allocate the items considering these factors.

Here's one possible allocation based on maximizing the value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**:
    - Highest values are for items 3 (91) and 5 (85).
    - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Highest values are for items 4 (88) and 5 (84).
    - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Highest values are for items 0 (70) and 6 (81).
    - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
    - Highest values are for items 2 (62) and 6 (78).
    - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
    - Highest values are for items 1 (73) and 2 (59).
    - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items and need to allocate 2 more. Let's consider the next best options:

- Agent 0 also values item 5 (85) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 0 (70) highly.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents fairly based on their preferences.
