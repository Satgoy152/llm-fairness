Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  31  31  94  50   0  26
1  18  52  12  96  70  48  39
2  87  34  81  45  93  73  29
3  57   4  99  57  32   7  28
4  57  97   4  15   0  75  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for the agents by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. We will ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.

Let's start by evaluating which agent values each item the most:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (87)
- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (97)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (99)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (96)
- Item 4: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (93)
- Item 5: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (75)
- Item 6: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (61)

Now, let's assign these items to the agents based on the highest valuations. We will also ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, while still maximizing the total valuation.

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 4
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 3
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 4
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (since Agent 4 already has two items, and Agent 0 values this item more than Agent 1 or Agent 3)

With this distribution, each agent gets at least one item, and the items are allocated to maximize the total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
