Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  79  64  27  91  23  63
1  41  89  30  41  45  38  10
2  12   7  64  90  25  15  36
3  55   8  83  62  25  42  85
4  42  56  71  62  67  67  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Since there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We will attempt to distribute items in a way that maximizes total valuation across all agents.

Here's a step-by-step method to achieve this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   - For each item, find the agent who values it the most.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Valuation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fair Distribution:**
   - If any agent has no items and it's possible to reallocate, adjust the allocation to ensure every agent has at least one item if feasible.

Let's perform these steps:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by agent 1 (41).
- Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 1 (89).
- Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 3 (83).
- Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 2 (90).
- Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 0 (91).
- Item 5: Highest valuation by agent 3 (42).
- Item 6: Highest valuation by agent 3 (85).

Initial Allocation based on highest valuation:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [2, 5, 6]
- Agent 4: []

Since agent 4 has no items and agent 3 has three items, we can reallocate item 5 to agent 4 to ensure all agents receive at least one item.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [2, 6]
- Agent 4: [5]

In JSON format, this allocation is represented as:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is based on the highest valuations to maximize overall satisfaction.
