Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  86  11  99  32  46  65
1  58   9  27  43  64  25  74
2  83  63  69  99  83  18  10
3  18  31  11  28  76  81  37
4  77  94   0  78   6  68  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated to exactly one agent. This can be done using a simple greedy approach, allocating items based on the highest valuation for each item.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. For each item, find the agent who values it the most and allocate the item to that agent.
2. Ensure that all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most with 83.
- **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most with 94.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most with 69.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most with 99.
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most with 76.
- **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most with 81.
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most with 74.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most, while all items are distributed among the agents.
