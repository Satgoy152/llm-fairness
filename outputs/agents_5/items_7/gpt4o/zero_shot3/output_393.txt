Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  23  97  86  87  47  45
1  82  64  70  90  96  81  72
2  22  19   6  24  29  94  13
3   8  85  32  32   2   6  96
4  58  24  26  48  97  35  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction based on their individual valuations. We should also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [81, 23, 97, 86, 87, 47, 45]
Agent 1: [82, 64, 70, 90, 96, 81, 72]
Agent 2: [22, 19,  6, 24, 29, 94, 13]
Agent 3: [ 8, 85, 32, 32,  2,  6, 96]
Agent 4: [58, 24, 26, 48, 97, 35, 57]
```

A possible approach is to allocate items to agents who value them the most. Here's a fair allocation:

1. **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0**: Agent 0 values Item 2 the highest at 97.
2. **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 4 the highest at 96.
3. **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2**: Agent 2 values Item 5 the highest at 94.
4. **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3**: Agent 3 values Item 1 the highest at 85.
5. **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 values Item 3 highly at 90 and is the highest among unallocated items.
6. **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 4**: Agent 4 values Item 0 at 58, which is relatively high compared to other unallocated items.
7. **Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3**: Agent 3 values Item 6 at 96, which is the highest for this item among unallocated items.

The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuation, with all 7 items distributed among the agents.
