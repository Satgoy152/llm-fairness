Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  90  11  53  54  65  14
1  87  43  93  26  84  71  19
2   4  68  60  86  92  33   9
3  73  65  76  54  24  29  66
4  59  24  70  38  67  80  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items valued highly: 1 (90), 5 (65)
   - Allocate items 1 and 5.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items valued highly: 2 (93), 0 (87)
   - Allocate items 2 and 0.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items valued highly: 4 (92), 3 (86)
   - Allocate item 4.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items valued highly: 2 (76), 0 (73)
   - Allocate item 6.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items valued highly: 5 (80), 4 (67)
   - Allocate item 3.

Now, letâ€™s ensure each item is allocated, and no item is double allocated:

- Items allocated to Agent 0: [1, 5]
- Items allocated to Agent 1: [2, 0]
- Items allocated to Agent 2: [4]
- Item allocated to Agent 3: [6]
- Item allocated to Agent 4: [3]

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated exactly once and considers the valuations provided by the agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
