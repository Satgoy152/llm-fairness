Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  71  83  35  43  42  42
1  53  70  89   0  57  94  34
2  69  22  91  71  82   4   7
3   7  84  67  25  78  87  42
4  33   6  36  46  65  40  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's overall value based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that Agent 0 values relatively highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly, avoiding overlaps with higher valued items from other agents.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that Agent 2 values relatively highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that Agent 3 values highly, avoiding overlaps with higher valued items from other agents.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items that Agent 4 values relatively highly.

Considering the valuations and aiming for a fair distribution, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1]
- **Agent 1**: Items [5]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2]
- **Agent 3**: Items [4, 6]
- **Agent 4**: Items [3]

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value while also distributing the items fairly across the agents.
