Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  38   3  92  57  47  51
1  30  26   9  68  53  79  63
2  54  87  38  33  71  52  19
3  82  57  45  13  13  80  31
4  28  71  91  90  53  25  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 and item 3.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 significantly.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 highly, but we will consider alternative items as some might overlap with others.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 and 6 highly.

Considering these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 0 and Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 5 (alternative to avoid overlap, allocate Item 4)
- Agent 4: Item 2 and Item 6

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, no item is unallocated, and the total number of allocated items is 7.
