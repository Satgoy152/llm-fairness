Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  11  43  82   4  54  97
1  99  14  52  92  94  28  63
2  46   9  60  77  53  86  16
3  68  94  77  48   9  98  42
4  91  86  26  96  77  25  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy where we try to maximize the total value across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the constraints, one possible approach is to assign items based on who values them the most, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:** The highest value is 99 by agent 1.
2. **Item 1:** The highest value is 94 by agent 3.
3. **Item 2:** The highest value is 77 by agent 3.
4. **Item 3:** The highest value is 96 by agent 4.
5. **Item 4:** The highest value is 94 by agent 1.
6. **Item 5:** The highest value is 98 by agent 3.
7. **Item 6:** The highest value is 97 by agent 0.

Following this strategy, we allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Gets item 6
- Agent 1: Gets items 0 and 4
- Agent 2: Gets no items
- Agent 3: Gets items 1, 2, and 5
- Agent 4: Gets item 3

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
