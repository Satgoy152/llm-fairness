Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  26  31  49   1  69  85
1  36  59  68  20  75   2  97
2  17  83  45   0  41  91  17
3  34  42  39  17  32   0  22
4  44  57  80  18  29  44  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 26 31 49  1 69 85]
 [36 59 68 20 75  2 97]
 [17 83 45  0 41 91 17]
 [34 42 39 17 32  0 22]
 [44 57 80 18 29 44 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a greedy approach by assigning items to the agent who values them the most. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most (44).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most (83).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it the most (80).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (49).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (75).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most (91).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most (97).

Now, let's allocate these items according to the above selections:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4, 6]
- Agent 2: [1, 5]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [0, 2]

Thus, the JSON format for these allocations would be:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
