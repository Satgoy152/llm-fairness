Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  93  17  89  15  71  89
1  29  27   8  16  85  24  33
2  95  52  83  47  96  77  58
3  53  11  22  22  89  36  77
4  21  31  43  33  86  63  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent either gets a high-value item or an optimal distribution that maximizes overall satisfaction. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valued items are 1 (93) and 3 (89).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valued item is 4 (85).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valued items are 4 (96) and 0 (95).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valued item is 4 (89).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valued item is 4 (86).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Best allocated to Agent 2 (95).
- **Item 1**: Best allocated to Agent 0 (93).
- **Item 2**: This item can be given to Agent 2 (83) since Agent 2 has another high valuation for item 4 and 0.
- **Item 3**: Best allocated to Agent 0 (89).
- **Item 4**: Best allocated to Agent 3 (89) to maximize their valuation since they don't have other high-value options.
- **Item 5**: Best allocated to Agent 2 (77).
- **Item 6**: Best allocated to Agent 0 (89).

Now, let's ensure every agent gets something or is considered:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 3, and 6.
- Agent 1 does not receive any items.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 3 receives item 4.
- Agent 4 does not receive any items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints of the problem.
