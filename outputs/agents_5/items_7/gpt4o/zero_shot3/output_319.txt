Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  78  94  25  31  59   6
1  85  60  25  93  14  93  20
2  43  28   3  76  19   5  38
3  51  73  19  54  63   6  78
4  20  58  45  62  82  69   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value of items each agent receives. A common approach for this type of problem is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's proceed with this method.

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (85). Assign Item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (78). Assign Item 1 to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (94). Assign Item 2 to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (93). Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 (82). Assign Item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (93). Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (78). Assign Item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, let's represent these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 3, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the agents while maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.
