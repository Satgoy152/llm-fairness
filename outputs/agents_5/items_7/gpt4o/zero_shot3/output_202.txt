Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  66  95  63  67  18  12
1  53  78  36  27  17  79  84
2  64  63  59  86  74  29  91
3   2  82  53  70  94  54  51
4  55  24  46   6  48  45  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. This involves assigning items such that the sum of the valuations for each agent is as high as possible while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent gets a fair share.

Let's consider a heuristic approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify high-value preferences:** First, identify the highest value each agent assigns to an item to prioritize their top choices.

2. **Allocate items based on preferences:** Start assigning items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring that each item is only allocated once and each agent's overall preference is considered.

3. **Balance the allocation:** Ensure that no agent is left without a fair allocation. If possible, balance the number of items each agent receives.

Here is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4] (Values: 95, 67)
- Agent 1: Item [5] (Value: 79)
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6] (Values: 86, 91)
- Agent 3: Item [1] (Value: 82)
- Agent 4: Item [0] (Value: 55)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```
