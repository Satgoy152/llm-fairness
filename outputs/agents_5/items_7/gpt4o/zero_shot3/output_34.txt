Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  69  81  71  18   0  51
1  17  71  65  11  21   3  40
2  39  33  47   5  49  40  95
3  24  73  55  66  72  86  46
4  42  34  33  96  29  73  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. One way to achieve this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that every agent receives at least one item. Here is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. We start by identifying the highest value for each item across all agents.
2. We assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. We ensure all agents receive at least one item by reassigning as necessary.

Let's work through this:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
- **Item 0**: Highest value is 61 by Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 73 by Agent 3.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 81 by Agent 0.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 96 by Agent 4.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 72 by Agent 3.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 86 by Agent 3.
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 2.

### Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [1, 4, 5]
- Agent 4: [3]

### Ensuring Each Agent Gets an Item:
Since Agent 1 has no items, we need to reallocate to ensure fairness:
- Reallocate Item 1 from Agent 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1's value for Item 1 is relatively high (71).

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [4, 5]
- Agent 4: [3]

Now, all agents have at least one item, and each item is allocated.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item while trying to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.
