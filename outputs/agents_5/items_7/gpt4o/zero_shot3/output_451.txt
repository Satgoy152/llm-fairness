Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  52  93  64  40  57  67
1  99  64  88  81  83  40   7
2  93  39  40  22  36  11  98
3  91   8  75  58  43   2   7
4   5  68  97  66  67  25  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value obtained by all agents collectively. One approach is to use a greedy strategy, where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the items one by one and allocate them accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 82
   - Agent 1 values it at 99 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 93
   - Agent 3 values it at 91
   - Agent 4 values it at 5

   Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 52
   - Agent 1 values it at 64 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 39
   - Agent 3 values it at 8
   - Agent 4 values it at 68 (highest)

   Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 93 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 88
   - Agent 2 values it at 40
   - Agent 3 values it at 75
   - Agent 4 values it at 97 (highest)

   Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 64
   - Agent 1 values it at 81 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 22
   - Agent 3 values it at 58
   - Agent 4 values it at 66

   Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 40
   - Agent 1 values it at 83 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 36
   - Agent 3 values it at 43
   - Agent 4 values it at 67

   Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 57 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 40
   - Agent 2 values it at 11
   - Agent 3 values it at 2
   - Agent 4 values it at 25

   Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 67
   - Agent 1 values it at 7
   - Agent 2 values it at 98 (highest)
   - Agent 3 values it at 7
   - Agent 4 values it at 71

   Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

Each agent is assigned items in a way that maximizes their total valuation based on the given table, and all 7 items are allocated.
