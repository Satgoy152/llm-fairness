Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  89  62  21  51  48  55
1  70  86  53  64  65  31  18
2  16  41  50  38  92  94  91
3   0  90   2  50  84  74  69
4  89  21  81  59  31   8  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Since they value item 1 the most at 89, we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 0 at 70. Therefore, we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 5 the most at 94, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 1 at 90, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 4 at 84, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 0 at 89, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 2 at 81, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 3 and 6:

- **Agent 0**: Item 6 is valued at 55, which is higher than their valuation for item 3, so item 6 is allocated to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 is valued at 64, which is higher than any other unallocated item value for Agent 1, so item 3 is allocated to Agent 1.

Finally, we have the following allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
