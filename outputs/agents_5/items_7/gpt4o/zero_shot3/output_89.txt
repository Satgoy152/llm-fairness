Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93   2  19  17  72  27  37
1  21  59  92  36   8  51  34
2  84   2  25  60  44   5  71
3  62  11   6  13  97  18  67
4  69  72  45  43  15  30  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value across all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve that:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:** Start by examining which agents value each item the most.
2. **Allocate Based on Preferences:** Assign items to agents who have the highest valuations for those items, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Ensure that no agent is left without an item unless it is necessary due to the number of items and agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Valuation for items is [93, 2, 19, 17, 72, 27, 37]
  - Highest valuation is for item 0 (93)

- **Agent 1**: Valuation for items is [21, 59, 92, 36, 8, 51, 34]
  - Highest valuation is for item 2 (92)

- **Agent 2**: Valuation for items is [84, 2, 25, 60, 44, 5, 71]
  - Highest valuation is for item 0 (84), but since item 0 is already allocated, next highest is item 6 (71)

- **Agent 3**: Valuation for items is [62, 11, 6, 13, 97, 18, 67]
  - Highest valuation is for item 4 (97)

- **Agent 4**: Valuation for items is [69, 72, 45, 43, 15, 30, 43]
  - Highest valuation is for item 1 (72)

At this point, items 3 and 5 are not allocated yet.

- **Agent 2**: Take item 3 with a value of 60 (second highest for agent 2)
- **Agent 1**: Take item 5 with a value of 51 (after 92 and 59, it's the third highest for agent 1)

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and that the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.
