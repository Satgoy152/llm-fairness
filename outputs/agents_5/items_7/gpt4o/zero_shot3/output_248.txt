Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  75  19  83   0  71  47
1  34  83  28  55  91  42   3
2  82  61  68  44  59  69  56
3  33  81  82  58  99  39  44
4  52  74  48  10  54  52  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We will ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3, 1, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4, 1, and 3.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 2.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 4, 2, and 1.
5. **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 1, 0, and 5.

We will try to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation. Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (valuation 83)
- **Agent 1**: Items 4 (valuation 91)
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 (valuation 82) and 6 (valuation 56)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (valuation 82)
- **Agent 4**: Items 1 (valuation 74) and 5 (valuation 52)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation for each one while using all items exactly once. 

The allocation in the requested JSON format is:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
