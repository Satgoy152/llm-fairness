Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  69  82   5  53  36  44
1  85  51  76  36  87   0  60
2  17   9  28  87  70  65  73
3  11  14  63  41  30  57  67
4  71  23  69  60  59  65  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [71 23 69 60 59 65 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a common approach where each agent gets at least one item, and we try to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 25, 69, 82,  5, 53, 36, 44
Agent 1: 85, 51, 76, 36, 87,  0, 60
Agent 2: 17,  9, 28, 87, 70, 65, 73
Agent 3: 11, 14, 63, 41, 30, 57, 67
Agent 4: 71, 23, 69, 60, 59, 65, 60
```

We can follow a simple heuristic:

1. Each agent gets at least one item.
2. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Assign items based on maximum valuation for each item, ensuring no agent gets too many items initially.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Make sure all 7 items are allocated.

Using this process, one possible allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2.
- Agent 1 highly values item 4.
- Agent 2 highly values item 3.
- Agent 3 highly values item 6.
- Agent 4 highly values item 0.

After ensuring initial allocation, distribute the remaining items:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 for better balance.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 for better balance.

The final allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```
