Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  51  51  93  99  84  54
1  30  34  18  20  17  19  18
2   6  56  71  86  72  69  94
3  51  10  38  45   1  62  41
4  31  10  16  33  44  36  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item since there are 7 items and 5 agents. Here's a suggested allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items with highest values are 4 and 3. Choose items 0 and 4 as they have considerable values.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign items that Agent 1 values above others. Item 2 is valued at 18, which is the highest for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Items with the highest values are 6 and 3. Choose item 6, which has the highest value.
4. **Agent 3**: Items with higher values are 0 and 5. Assign item 5, which is considerably valued.
5. **Agent 4**: Remaining items are 1 and 3. Assign item 3 as it has the highest value among the options left.

This results in the following allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [1, 3]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```
