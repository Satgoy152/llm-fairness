Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  74  87  86  12   6  54
1  14  85  55  49  11  93  33
2  92  44   1  96  64  15  71
3  73  45  69  29  92  33  67
4  11  88   2  67  78  47  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering the valuations, we want to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total value. We also want to distribute the items evenly across the agents, if possible. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 highly.

Now, we need to assign the remaining items in a manner that doesn't conflict with the high-value allocations for each agent. We should also try to balance the number of items each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (highest value)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (highest value)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (highest value)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (highest value)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (highest value)

Now, we have allocated 5 items and have 2 more items left to allocate (items 0 and 6). For balancing purposes, we can do:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (second highest value for Agent 0)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (second highest value for Agent 2)

This gives a fair distribution, considering both value and balance. The allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
