Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  87  21  87   4  32  10  86
1  14  92  72  71  70  99  97
2  39  32  15  96  77  20  54
3   2  12  85  51  95  58  12
4  69  34   3  20  42  32  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as balanced as possible in terms of the agents' valuations. Here's one way to potentially achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 0 and item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for items 1 and 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.
- Agent 3 receives item 4.
- Agent 4 receives item 2.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, the total number of items allocated is 7, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints of the problem.
