Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  16  54  84  46   5  78
1  51  68  50  93  26   7  77
2  19  65  26  86   1  95  16
3   1  16  95  69  37  50   3
4  71  76  58  73  67  38  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents. One common approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach is known as the "maximum valuation" method.

Let's analyze the table and allocate each item to the agent who values it the most:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 52
  - Agent 1 values at 51
  - Agent 2 values at 19
  - Agent 3 values at 1
  - Agent 4 values at 71 (highest)
  - Assign to Agent 4.

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 16
  - Agent 1 values at 68 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values at 65
  - Agent 3 values at 16
  - Agent 4 values at 76 (highest)
  - Assign to Agent 4.

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 54
  - Agent 1 values at 50
  - Agent 2 values at 26
  - Agent 3 values at 95 (highest)
  - Agent 4 values at 58
  - Assign to Agent 3.

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 84
  - Agent 1 values at 93 (highest)
  - Agent 2 values at 86
  - Agent 3 values at 69
  - Agent 4 values at 73
  - Assign to Agent 1.

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 46
  - Agent 1 values at 26
  - Agent 2 values at 1
  - Agent 3 values at 37
  - Agent 4 values at 67 (highest)
  - Assign to Agent 4.

- **Item 5**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 5
  - Agent 1 values at 7
  - Agent 2 values at 95 (highest)
  - Agent 3 values at 50
  - Agent 4 values at 38
  - Assign to Agent 2.

- **Item 6**: 
  - Agent 0 values at 78 (highest)
  - Agent 1 values at 77
  - Agent 2 values at 16
  - Agent 3 values at 3
  - Agent 4 values at 62
  - Assign to Agent 0.

Now, we can present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
