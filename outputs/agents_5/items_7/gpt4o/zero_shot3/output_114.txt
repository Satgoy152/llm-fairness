Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  70  33  30   2  96  73
1  66  18   4  69   6  64  66
2  76  35  38  66  68  38  87
3  74  61  40  44  85  65  87
4  73  36  67  89  79  67  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We can use a heuristic approach to assign the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated is 7, and each agent can receive an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 0 (81)
- Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 0 (70)
- Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 4 (67)
- Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 4 (89)
- Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 3 (85)
- Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 0 (96)
- Item 6: Highest value is by Agent 2 (87)

Now, we assign the items accordingly, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

1. Agent 0: Items 0, 1, and 5
2. Agent 1: No items
3. Agent 2: Item 6
4. Agent 3: Item 4
5. Agent 4: Items 2 and 3

Allocating the items as described above satisfies the condition that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items. The JSON representation of the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```
