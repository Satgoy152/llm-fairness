Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  26  60  32  67  21  51
1  99  14  63  12  49  73  48
2  47  62   8  89  73  34  28
3  53   5  43  27  88  42  86
4  47  41  78  94  44  68  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on the valuations provided. A straightforward approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each item is only allocated once.

Let's go through the items and allocate them to the agents:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values item 0 the most with a value of 99.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values item 1 the most with a value of 62.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values item 2 the most with a value of 78.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 4 values item 3 the most with a value of 94.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values item 4 the most with a value of 88.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values item 5 the most with a value of 73.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values item 6 the most with a value of 90.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.
- Agent 3 receives item 4.
- Agent 4 receives items 2, 3, and 6.

This allocation respects each agent's preferences and ensures all items are distributed.
