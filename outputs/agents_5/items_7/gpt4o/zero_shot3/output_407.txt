Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  56  56   6  55  71  33
1  36  83   3  40  55  29  65
2  58  71  28  20   7  42  13
3  51  84  65   8  57  27  50
4  58  98  39  34  47  46  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on the given valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5. We can assign item 5 (value 71) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 6. We can assign item 1 (value 83) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5. However, since item 5 is already assigned to Agent 0, we can assign item 0 (value 58) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 3. Since item 1 is already assigned, we can assign item 3 (value 8) to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 4. Since item 1 is already assigned, we can assign item 4 (value 47) to Agent 4.

After these assignments, items 2 and 6 remain unallocated. We can assign them as follows:

- Assign item 2 (value 56) to Agent 0 (who also has a high valuation for this item).
- Assign item 6 (value 65) to Agent 1 (who also has a high valuation for this item).

Now, every item is allocated, and we have ensured that each agent receives at least one item, while maximizing the value based on the given table.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
