Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78  96  63  36  63  18  21
1  59  27  39  88   0  96  28
2  10  91  96   2  76  31  74
3  91  12  68  13  44  89  59
4  50  79  77   9  33  58  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will aim to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 highly values item 5.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 0.
- Agent 4 highly values item 1.

We can proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (value 91).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (value 96).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (value 96).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (value 88).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (value 76).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value 96).
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (value 21).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations for the items.
