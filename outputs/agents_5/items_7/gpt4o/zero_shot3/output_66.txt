Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12   4   1  42  48  29  64
1  85  12  28  26  54  89  74
2  99  33  72  10  50   9  99
3  72  75  12   5  48  23  33
4   9   2  31   6  42  90  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and a total of 7 items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (64), Item 4 (48), Item 3 (42)
   - Let's allocate Item 6 to Agent 0

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (89), Item 0 (85)
   - Let's allocate Item 5 to Agent 1

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 6 (99), Item 2 (72)
   - Let's allocate Item 0 to Agent 2

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (75), Item 0 (72)
   - Let's allocate Item 1 to Agent 3

5. Agent 4:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (90), Item 4 (42)
   - Let's allocate Item 4 to Agent 4

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items. Weâ€™ll continue to allocate based on the next highest valuations:

- Agent 1: Allocate Item 3 (26) since it has a higher valuation than others available.
- Agent 3: Allocate Item 2 (12) since it has a higher valuation than others available.

Now, all items have been allocated, and each agent has at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
