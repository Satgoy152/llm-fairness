Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  71  33  27   6  36  37
1  94  29   8  64   5  40   7
2  55  72  97  66  52  12  94
3  56  35  27   4  72   5  41
4  80  50  28  89  57  12  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[83 71 33 27  6 36 37]
 [94 29  8 64  5 40  7]
 [55 72 97 66 52 12 94]
 [56 35 27  4 72  5 41]
 [80 50 28 89 57 12 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here is one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0:
   - Values item 0 the most at 83.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. Agent 1:
   - Values item 0 the most at 94, but item 0 is already assigned, so choose the next highest item.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, valued at 64.

3. Agent 2:
   - Values item 2 the most at 97.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. Agent 3:
   - Values item 4 the most at 72.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

5. Agent 4:
   - Values item 3 the most at 89, but item 3 is already assigned, so choose the next highest item.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4, valued at 53.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items:

6. Agent 2:
   - Since items 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are allocated, consider the next highest value items.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, valued at 72.

7. Agent 0:
   - Since items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are allocated, consider the next highest value items.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0, valued at 36.

All items are now allocated fairly. Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6]
}
```
