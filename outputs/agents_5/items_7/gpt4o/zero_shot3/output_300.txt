Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  80  72  25  74  19  13
1  49   4  89  51  49  81  45
2  50  83  89  29  62  16  39
3  46  32   1  81  37   9  91
4  21  98  69  42  11  89  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[32 80 72 25 74 19 13]
 [49  4 89 51 49 81 45]
 [50 83 89 29 62 16 39]
 [46 32  1 81 37  9 91]
 [21 98 69 42 11 89 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives from the items allocated to them. Given the values in the table, we can attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 1
- Agent 1 receives item 2
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 4
- Agent 3 receives items 3 and 6
- Agent 4 receives item 5

This allocation tries to balance the valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are assigned and each agent is considered.
