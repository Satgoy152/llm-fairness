Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  22  58  37  26  28  99
1  42   0  92   9  94  93  29
2   0  37  32  87  80  63  40
3  37  66  17  75  81  36  73
4  81  53  47  34  67   0  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, one approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated and that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. In this scenario, however, since the number of agents (5) does not divide evenly into the number of items (7), some agents will receive an unequal number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 6 with a value of 99.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 4 with a value of 94.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 3 with a value of 87.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 4 with a value of 81, but since item 4 is already allocated, the next highest is item 3 with a value of 75, which is also taken. The next is item 0 with a value of 66.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 0 with a value of 81, but since item 0 is allocated, the next highest is item 4 with a value of 67.

Now, ensure all items are allocated:

- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 66, but already taken. The next is Agent 4 with 53.
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 with 92, but already taken. The next is Agent 4 with 47.
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 with 93, but already taken. The next is Agent 2 with 63.

After ensuring no agents are left without items (since there are more items than agents, each agent can receive at least one item):

- **Agent 0**: [6]
- **Agent 1**: [4]
- **Agent 2**: [5]
- **Agent 3**: [0]
- **Agent 4**: [1, 2, 3]

This ensures that each agent receives the items they value the most, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed, respecting the highest possible valuation for each agent.
