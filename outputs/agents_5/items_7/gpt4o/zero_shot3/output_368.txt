Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43   4   9   9  36  47  85
1  87  41  38  59  76  21  39
2  67  88  65  25  34  33  42
3  98  87   6  65  26  20  54
4  30  70  77  90  39  84  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated in total. A potential method to achieve fairness is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that no items are left unallocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to a potential allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item**: Examine which agent values each item the most and consider allocating the item to that agent.

2. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Make sure that each of the 7 items is given to some agent.

3. **Balance the allocation**: Attempt to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their overall valuations.

Based on the given valuations, we can proceed with the following allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 98.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 88.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most at 77.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most at 90.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 76.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 47.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 85.

Now let's look at the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4],     
    "2": [1],  
    "3": [0], 
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated and takes into account each agent's highest valuation for certain items.
