Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  13  43  21  41   8  90
1   0  85  27  62  68  81  21
2   4  89  18  28  34  28  33
3  17   2  41  83  65  90  50
4  96  37  82  43  93  67  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations each agent receives. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most and hasn't yet received an item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item unless there aren't enough items. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value: 90, highest value for item 6).
2. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value: 90, highest value for item 5).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value: 93, highest value for item 4).
4. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value: 89, highest value for item 1).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value: 62, highest value for item 3).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 4 (value: 82, highest value for item 2).
7. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value: 86, highest value for item 0).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```
