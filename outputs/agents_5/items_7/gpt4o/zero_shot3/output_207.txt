Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  64  40  59  99  59  51
1  73  63  34  91  74  19  63
2  96  25  62  35  87  47   9
3  63  92   4  56  38  49  79
4  88  22  77  98  90  26  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring every item is assigned to exactly one agent and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value 99)
   - Second highest: Item 1 (value 64)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value 91)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (value 73)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (value 96)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (value 87)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 92)
   - Second highest: Item 6 (value 79)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value 98)
   - Second highest: Item 0 (value 88)

Now, let's try to allocate these items, ensuring each is assigned to only one agent:

- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 4.

Each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [2]
}
```
