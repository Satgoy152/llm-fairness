Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  82  38  30  31  34  31
1  91  39   3  15  78   3  51
2  31  31  79  83  30  86  36
3  34  35  96  61  23  55  13
4  35  35   7  80  95  52  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 39  3 15 78  3 51]
 [31 31 79 83 30 86 36]

 [35 35  7 80 95 52 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are distributed. We can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on the given table.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest (93).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest (82).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it the highest (96).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest (83).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it the highest (95).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest (86).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 1, as agent 1 has the second highest valuation (51) and no items yet.

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated, and each agent receives items according to their highest valuations, where possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
