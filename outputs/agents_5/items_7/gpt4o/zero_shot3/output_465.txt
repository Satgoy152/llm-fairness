Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  88  45  57   4  62   1
1  95  50  77  10  86  88  82
2  87  11  62  81  61  65  77
3  68  91  63   8  23  78  94
4  32  40  66   2  93  82  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all items are distributed. We will aim to allocate items such that the overall valuation for each agent is maximized, while also considering fairness.

Here is one possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 1 has a high value for Agent 0 (88), which is the highest value for this agent. 
   - Item 0 also has a relatively high value for Agent 0 (51).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 has a high value for Agent 1 (77).
   - Item 5 is also valuable for Agent 1 (88).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 6 is valuable for Agent 2 (77).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 3 is the highest value for Agent 3 (8).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 4 is the highest value for Agent 4 (93).

Let's check the allocation to ensure all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 2: Item [6]
- Agent 3: Item [3]
- Agent 4: Item [4]

This allocation uses all 7 items. Here's the JSON format for this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
