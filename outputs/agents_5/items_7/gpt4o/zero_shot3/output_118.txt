Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  81  31  42  10  97  54
1   5  41  76  24  94  61   2
2  33  79  63  11  47  14   2
3   8  51  79  57  80  82  98
4  16  92  46  51  29  55  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[15 81 31 42 10 97 54]
 [ 5 41 76 24 94 61  2]
 [33 79 63 11 47 14  2]
 [ 8 51 79 57 80 82 98]
 [16 92 46 51 29 55 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and distribute them such that each agent receives an approximately equal share of total value, to the extent possible. Given the table provided, we will allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, trying to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here is the table of valuations for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  81  31  42  10  97  54
1   5  41  76  24  94  61   2
2  33  79  63  11  47  14   2
3   8  51  79  57  80  82  98
4  16  92  46  51  29  55  68
```

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Highest value: Agent 2 with value 33.
   
2. **Item 1:** 
   - Highest value: Agent 4 with value 92.
   
3. **Item 2:** 
   - Highest value: Agent 1 with value 76.
   
4. **Item 3:** 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 with value 57.
   
5. **Item 4:** 
   - Highest value: Agent 1 with value 94.
   
6. **Item 5:** 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 with value 97.
   
7. **Item 6:** 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 with value 98.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [2, 4]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3, 6]
- Agent 4: [1]

These allocations ensure that all 7 items are distributed among the 5 agents, trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
