Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35   8   3  53  28  56  60
1  17  53  87  33  86  12   9
2  24  35  39  41  30  19  21
3  31   1  52  81  83  72  25
4  10  78  59  74  84  58  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must ensure that each agent gets a reasonable number of items based on their valuations. An optimal way to do this is to try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (60), Item 5 (56)
   - Allocation: [6, 5]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (87)
   - Allocation: [2]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (41)
   - Allocation: [3]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (83)
   - Allocation: [4]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (78), Item 0 (10)
   - Allocation: [1, 0]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items according to their highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 0]
}
```
