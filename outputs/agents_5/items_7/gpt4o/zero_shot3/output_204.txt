Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  23  77  97  88  39  60
1   4  32  92  34  37  19  58
2  26  64  65  24  91  50  86
3  21  51  89  99  15  11  40
4   9  55  42  64  76  99   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others, but we will try to distribute them as equitably as possible based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign items to agents based on the highest valuations first.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to maintain a total of 7 items distributed among 5 agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 (99) and item 2 (89).
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 5 (99).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (91).
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (45).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (92), but item 2 is already allocated to Agent 3, so we look for the next highest valuation.
- Agent 1 has the second-highest valuation for item 6 (58).

This leaves us with item 1, which has the highest valuation by Agent 2 (64).

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4
- Agent 3: Items 2, 3
- Agent 4: Item 5

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items, with attempts made to maximize the value each agent receives.
