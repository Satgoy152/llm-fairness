Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  14  46  85  86  93  50
1   0  26  31  47  56  72  51
2   1  60  34  13  41  19  17
3  43  82   1  31  29  50  15
4  95  35  48  72  97  59  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that seeks to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no conflicts in allocation.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the highest value:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 95.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 4.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 82.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 3.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 48.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 4.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 85.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 0.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 97.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 4.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 0.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 50.
   - Assign item 6 to agent 0.

Now, each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and all 7 items are distributed. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and every agent is included in the allocation, even if they receive no items.
