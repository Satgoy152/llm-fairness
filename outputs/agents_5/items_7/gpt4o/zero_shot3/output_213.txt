Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  87  56  56  29  53  59
1   5  48   5  81   8   5  62
2  13  48  52  73  39  62  97
3  14  61  42  69  63  98  51
4  98  68  91   4  39  55  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them based on the valuations provided. We want to ensure that each agent gets at least one item or a fair share of items based on their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (87).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (81).
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (97).
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (98).
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (98).

After allocating these highest-value items to each agent, we need to allocate the remaining items 2 and 4. We can look at the remaining unallocated items:

- Item 2: 
  - Agent 4 values it at 91, which is the highest among remaining preferences.
- Item 4:
  - Agent 3 values it at 63, which is the highest among remaining preferences.

This gives us the following fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets items based on their preferences.
