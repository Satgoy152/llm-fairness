Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46   5   2   8  51  23  28
1  18   8  85  50  77  10  47
2  59  94   6  98   5  35  82
3  65  55  40  42  57  85  99
4  67  74  17  64  45  46  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction or fairness. One common approach is to ensure that every agent gets at least one item they value highly, if possible.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [46, 5, 2, 8, 51, 23, 28]
Agent 1: [18, 8, 85, 50, 77, 10, 47]
Agent 2: [59, 94, 6, 98, 5, 35, 82]
Agent 3: [65, 55, 40, 42, 57, 85, 99]
Agent 4: [67, 74, 17, 64, 45, 46, 53]
```

By examining the highest valuations for each agent and distributing items such that each agent gets a valuable item (and considering the constraints), we can propose the following allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 51).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 85).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 98).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6 (value 99).
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 1 (value 74).

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 5. Since Agent 0 values item 0 (46) highly and item 5 (23) moderately, we can give Agent 0 these items to balance the allocation.

By doing so, we ensure that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
