Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  76  85  71  42  97  67
1  82  81  42  37  25  48  96
2  49   2  81  56  73  81  35
3  51   5  89  94  62  67  93
4  55  48  68  46  16  76  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value most. Given the table of valuations, we will attempt to maximize the total value assigned to each agent by considering the highest-valued items for each agent.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Highest Valued Items for Each Agent**: Each agent will prefer items that have the highest value for them.

2. **Assign Items to Maximize the Overall Satisfaction**: Make sure each agent receives at least some items they highly value, while also considering the distribution of items.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Since there are 7 items, each needs to be assigned to an agent.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 5 the most (value 97)
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the most (value 82)
- **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the most (value 81)
- **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the most (value 94)
- **Agent 4**: Values item 4 the most (value 76)

This leaves items 1 and 6 to be assigned.

- **Agent 0**: Values item 6 the second highest (value 67)
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the second highest (value 81)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations, and all 7 items are allocated.
