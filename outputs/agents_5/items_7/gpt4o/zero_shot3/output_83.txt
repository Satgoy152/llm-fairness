Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  45   3  54  63  94  29
1  63  25  39  38  37  93  22
2  22  27  25  61  91  47  43
3  36  68  29  77   9  21  82
4  32  20  28  41  41  86  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. Let's evaluate the values in the table and try to distribute the items in a manner that seems fair based on maximizing the value for each agent.

Here are the allocations:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 4 and 5. Let's allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a high value for item 0. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 3. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a high value for item 6. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a moderate value for item 1. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
   
Now let's allocate the remaining item 2 to an agent:

- For item 2, Agent 1 has a moderate value of 39. Since Agent 1 only has one item, it's reasonable to allocate item 2 to Agent 1 to balance the distribution.

Considering these allocations, the JSON representation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.
