Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  85  68  41  86  42  90
1  62  28  29  68  31  27  87
2  87  14  26  71  62  92  22
3  48   7  65  53   1  66  48
4  75   9   0  13  42  92  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given that there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will have more than one item. Let's allocate the items based on their highest valuations to each agent, making sure no item is assigned twice and all items are assigned.

Let's begin by reviewing the valuations to identify the best matchups:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (90).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (87).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (92).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (66).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest (92).

To balance the allocations and maximize fairness, it appears reasonable to:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (since 90 is the highest valuation for item 6).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (since their valuation is 92, matching Agent 4, but distributing load).
3. Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (the next highest valuation after item 5).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (since their second-highest valuation is for item 3).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (since 65 is the highest remaining valuation for item 2).
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (since their valuation is 86, the highest remaining for item 4).
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (since it's their next best available option).

This provides each agent with at least one item and ensures all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
