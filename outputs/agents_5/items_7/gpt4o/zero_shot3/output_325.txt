Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32   8  62  79  38  93  11
1  47  65  43  43  27  15  58
2  96  91  37  43  41  58  53
3  14  40  58  87  90  71   6
4  62  31  45   9  58   5  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I'll consider maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Start by allocating the item with the highest value to agent 0, which is item 5 (value = 93). Next, allocate item 3 (value = 79). These two items provide the highest valuation for agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 (value = 65) to agent 1, as it's the highest value for this agent. Next, allocate item 6 (value = 58).

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (value = 96) to agent 2, as it's the highest value for this agent.

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 4 (value = 90) to agent 3, as it's the highest value for this agent.

5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2 (value = 45) to agent 4, as this is the remaining unallocated item.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures fairness by taking into account each agent's highest value items while also ensuring that all items are distributed.
