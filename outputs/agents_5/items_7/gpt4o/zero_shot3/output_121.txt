Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  65  25  35  23  79  11
1  62  95   7  98  13   3  73
2  18  35  62  26  61  24  70
3  18  24  12  75  23  34  12
4  76  86  10  93  84  58  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation as much as possible, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's attempt to allocate based on maximizing the satisfaction (valuation) for each agent.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 4 (value 76).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 95).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 62).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 98).

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 4 (value 84).

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 79).

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 70).

By this allocation, the items are distributed as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Items 0, 4

Now, I'll present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are allocated and each agent receives the items that provide the highest value based on the given data.
