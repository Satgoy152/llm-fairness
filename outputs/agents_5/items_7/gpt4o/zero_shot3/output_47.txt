Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  12  80  77   9  17   1
1  13   8  60  90  94  92  33
2   3  54  60  22   5  13  91
3   1  55  60  59  23  43  56
4   1  86  28  95  73  37  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for all agents while trying to ensure a fair distribution. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the valuations provided:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 35 by Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 86 by Agent 4.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 80 by Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 95 by Agent 4.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 94 by Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 92 by Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: The highest value is 91 by Agent 2.

Now, we need to ensure a fair distribution. Note that Agents 3 and 2 have not yet been assigned any items. We will try to adjust the allocation to include them:

- **Agent 0**: Currently has items [0, 2]. 
- **Agent 1**: Currently has items [4, 5].
- **Agent 2**: Needs an item, assign item 6 (highest value for agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Needs an item, we can reassign item 3 from Agent 4, as Agent 4 has multiple items.
- **Agent 4**: Reassign item 3 to Agent 3, keep item 1.

Final Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: [0, 2]
- **Agent 1**: [4, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [6]
- **Agent 3**: [3]
- **Agent 4**: [1]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
