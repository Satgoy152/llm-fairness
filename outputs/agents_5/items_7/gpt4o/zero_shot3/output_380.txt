Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  79  50  11  94  50  45
1  83  36  84  78  79  70  40
2  12  48  74  24  73  79  72
3  39  70  78  65  47  26  11
4  86  15  38  24  86  38  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can approach this problem by assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuations for those items.

Let's go through the items one by one and allocate them to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 86.
   
2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 79.
   
3. Item 2:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 84.
   
4. Item 3:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 78.
   
5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 94.
   
6. Item 5:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 79.
   
7. Item 6:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 72.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item. Currently, agent 3 does not have an item, so we need to adjust the allocation slightly:

- Move Item 3 from Agent 1 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 values it decently at 65, and it will ensure every agent receives at least one item.

The final allocations will be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
