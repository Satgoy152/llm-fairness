Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  11  83  96  84  82  95
1  83  52  55  41  33  28  87
2   6  84  20   9  15  26  23
3  55  29  58   4  20  65  33
4  67  79  44  89  57  26  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total utility or value. The goal is to distribute the items such that the overall satisfaction (or value) of all agents is maximized.

Let's consider the valuations given and try to allocate the items:

1. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 0 with a value of 96.
2. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 1 with a value of 83.
3. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 2 with a value of 84.
4. **Item 5** has the highest value for Agent 3 with a value of 65.
5. **Item 4** has the highest value for Agent 4 with a value of 57.
6. **Item 6** has a high value of 95 for Agent 0, but Agent 1 also has a high value of 87 for this item.
7. **Item 2** can go to Agent 0 who values it at 83, which is a significant value.

Now let's make the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3 (values 83, 96)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6 (values 83, 87)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (value 84)
- Agent 3: Item 5 (value 65)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (value 57)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total value is maximized given the constraints.
