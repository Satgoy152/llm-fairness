Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  35  56  41  50  72  74
1  97  72   2  34  60  11  17
2   5  80   1  90  88  91  50
3  92  43  10  60  57  77  28
4  85  34  92  94  10  63  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's the step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: For each agent, identify the items they value highest.
2. **Allocate Unique High-Value Items**: Assign items to agents based on unique high valuations, attempting to give each agent at least one item.
3. **Resolve Conflicts**: If multiple agents value the same item the highest, prioritize the agent who has fewer or no items yet.
4. **Ensure Full Allocation**: If there are unallocated items, distribute them among the agents ensuring each one gets at least one item if possible.

Following this strategy, we allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Best values are 5 and 6. Assign item 6 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 0. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 5. Assign item 5 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 0, but it's taken. Next highest is item 3. Assign item 3 to agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Highest values are 3 and 6, both taken. Next is item 2. Assign item 2 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated items 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6. Items 1 and 4 remain unallocated.

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (next highest valuation).

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
