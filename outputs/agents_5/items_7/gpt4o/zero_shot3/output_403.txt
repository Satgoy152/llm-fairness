Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  86  79  46  86  74  83
1  78  51  55  51  75  25  31
2  24  51  76  10  53  65  64
3  14  46  70  76  61  60  70
4  52   8  45   5  84   7  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their preferences, we can use a greedy algorithm. The idea is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. 

Let's go through the table and allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 78.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 79.
4. Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 76.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 83.

From this allocation, we see that Agent 0 receives too many items. We need to ensure a fair distribution, so let's adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible. 

Revised allocation:
1. Item 0 goes to Agent 1.
2. Item 1 goes to Agent 0.
3. Item 2 goes to Agent 2.
4. Item 3 goes to Agent 3.
5. Item 4 goes to Agent 4.
6. Item 5 goes to Agent 0.
7. Item 6 goes to Agent 0.

Now, each agent receives at least one item, and items are allocated based on a fair distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
