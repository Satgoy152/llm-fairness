Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  59  12  23  74  73  37
1  12  87  19  74  58  18  71
2  82  14  29  53  38  85  24
3  41  85  46  31  64  95  50
4  97   4  29  21  77  23  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated, we can use a strategy that considers the highest valuation each agent has for the items.

Let's start by examining the table for the highest values each agent has for the items, then attempt to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 highest (74).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 highest (87).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highest (85).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 highest (95), but needs to choose another due to conflict with Agent 2. Values item 1 next highest (85), but needs to choose another due to conflict with Agent 1, and item 4 is valued at 64.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 highest (97).

Now, let's resolve conflicts and allocate items:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item 4.
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 1.
- **Agent 2**: Gets item 5.
- **Agent 3**: Gets item 6 (since item 5 is already taken, item 6 is next highest value at 50).
- **Agent 4**: Gets item 0.

Now, items 2 and 3 are left unallocated. Let's allocate them to the agents with the least items and relatively higher values:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 4, next best option is item 2 (value 12), but Agent 2 values it higher.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 1, next best option is item 3 (value 74).
- **Agent 2**: Gets item 2 (value 29).
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 6, no more allocation needed.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 0, no more allocation needed.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [1, 3]
- Agent 2: [5, 2]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [0]

Here is the JSON representation of the final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
