Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  54   0  24  33  29  97
1  71   1  92  22  72  66  93
2  80  86  19  98  83  48  32
3  56  75  85  59  74  64  26
4  28  37  78   4  21  23  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7 and that each agent gets an integer number of items. Considering the valuations of each agent for the items, we can aim to allocate items such that the overall satisfaction or total valuation is maximized while ensuring fairness.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 6.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most.

We can distribute the items based on these preferences while ensuring all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Item 6 (Highest valuation: 97)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (Highest valuation: 92)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (Highest valuation: 98)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (Highest valuation: 75)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (Highest valuation: 23)

This leaves items 0 and 4 unallocated. We can allocate these remaining items based on secondary preferences ensuring all agents get a fair number of items:

- Agent 0 can take item 0 (Valuation: 56) as it has a higher valuation for it compared to others.
- Agent 1 can take item 4 (Valuation: 72) as it has a higher valuation for it compared to others.

Thus, the allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
This ensures all 7 items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
