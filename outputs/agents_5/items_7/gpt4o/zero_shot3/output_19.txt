Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  63  65  24  93  86  18
1  24  68  23  45  86  58   4
2   6  85   0  77  76  42  47
3  58  54  71  64  60  92  21
4  22  90  39   0  59  27  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[69 63 65 24 93 86 18]
 [24 68 23 45 86 58  4]
 [ 6 85  0 77 76 42 47]

 [22 90 39  0 59 27 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider a strategy where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. This strategy ensures that each item is assigned to an agent who highly values it, thereby maximizing overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Let's go through the items one by one:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 69.
   
2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 90.
   
3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 71.
   
4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 77.
   
5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
   
6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 92.
   
7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 95.

Thus, based on the highest valuations, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives items that they value highly, and all items are allocated.
