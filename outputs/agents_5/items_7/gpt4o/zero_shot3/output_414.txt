Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  72  15  55  95  44   3
1  31  87  57  60  31  25  63
2  56  46  76  54  64  20  50
3  93  63  34  67  18  25  75
4  60  67  93  60  86  82  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We can approach this problem by assigning items to agents based on their highest individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are allocated without any conflicts.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Item 0:** Agent 3 values it the most (93).
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it the most (72).
- **Item 2:** Agent 4 values it the most (93).
- **Item 3:** Agent 3 values it the most (67).
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it the most (95).
- **Item 5:** Agent 4 values it the most (82).
- **Item 6:** Agent 3 values it the most (75).

### Initial Allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [] - Needs at least 1 item.
- Agent 2: [] - Needs at least 1 item.
- Agent 3: [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 4: [2, 5]

### Adjustments:

- Transfer item 3 from Agent 3 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it reasonably (60) and Agent 1 has no items.
- Transfer item 6 from Agent 3 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it reasonably (50) and Agent 2 has no items.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [2, 5]

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, maximizes their valuation based on the initial preferences, and all items are allocated.
