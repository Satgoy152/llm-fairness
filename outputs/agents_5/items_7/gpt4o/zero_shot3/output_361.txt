Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  76  76  96   2  21  66
1  66  82  28  31   0  67  88
2  86  81  82  59  72  86  88
3  58  37   1  99  59  58  46
4  28  22  23  59  81  73  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (since there are 7 items and 5 agents). We'll try to distribute the items based on the highest value each agent places on the available items, taking care not to allocate an item to more than one agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 highly at 96.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 highly at 88.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 highly at 82, but item 6 is valued at 88.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly at 99, but item 3 is already taken, so we go with item 0 valued at 58.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 highly at 81.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 2 are highly valued; item 1 is valued at 76.
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 is the next best option valued at 67.
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 is still available and valued at 82.
- **Agent 3**: Item 0 has been allocated, so no additional items.
- **Agent 4**: Already has an item.

After matching each agent with their highest available options and ensuring all items are allocated, we have the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, the distribution attempts to maximize the value each agent gets based on their preferences, and every agent gets at least one item.
