Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1   2  39  29   6  10  11
1  93  53  49  26  50  21  22
2  34  71  78  57  22  70   0
3  29  82  85  72  44  15  46
4  92  24   2  19   9  33  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1  2 39 29  6 10 11]
 [93 53 49 26 50 21 22]
 [34 71 78 57 22 70  0]
 [29 82 85 72 44 15 46]
 [92 24  2 19  9 33 75]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the table, let's examine the best allocations for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 2 (value of 39).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 0 (value of 93).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 2 (value of 78), but item 2 is already allocated. The next highest is item 1 (value of 71).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 2 (value of 85), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 1 (value of 82), but it's also allocated. The next highest value is item 3 (value of 72).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 0 (value of 92), but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 6 (value of 75).

Let's allocate based on these values while ensuring every agent gets at least one item:

- Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- Allocate item 6 to agent 4.

Now, check for any unallocated items:
- Items 4 and 5 are still unallocated. 
- Assign item 4 to agent 3 (next highest value).
- Assign item 5 to agent 4 (next highest value).

This ensures that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [6, 5]
}
```
