Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82   5  68  33  30  21  66
1  81  11   3  47  89  96  55
2  59  74  49  30  29  99  31
3  93  88  39  83   4  44  68
4  48  70  47  90  65  44  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations of the items. Let's consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest, so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly, but it's already taken by agent 1. The next best item for agent 2 is item 1, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 highly, but it's already taken. The next best available item is item 3, so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 highly, but it's already taken. The next best available item is item 4, so we allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. Now we need to allocate the remaining items 2 and 6. Agent 0 values item 2 highly, so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.
7. Finally, item 6 is best valued by agent 0 among the remaining options, but agent 0 already has a fair share, so we allocate item 6 to agent 1 who also values it decently.

Now let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and the preferences of the agents are respected as much as possible given the constraints.
