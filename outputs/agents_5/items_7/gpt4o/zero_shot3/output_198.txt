Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38   1  55  38  81  36   1
1  97  61  46  34  32  24  43
2  24   3  31   5  67  19  13
3   1  19  92  83  29  44  51
4  26  61  54  65  98  66  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 4 (Value: 81).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is item 0 (Value: 97).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 4, but it's already taken by Agent 0. The next highest is item 2 (Value: 31).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - The highest value for Agent 3 is item 2, but it's already taken by Agent 2. The next highest is item 3 (Value: 83).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - The highest value for Agent 4 is item 4, but it's already taken by Agent 0. The next highest is item 6 (Value: 91).

6. **Reallocate remaining items**:
   - Items 1 and 5 are still available.
   - Agent 0 can take item 1 (Value: 1).
   - Agent 4 can take item 5 (Value: 66).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item based on their highest valuations available.
