Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  42  43  98  83  37  34
1  67  16  29  15  53  48  27
2  87  20  68  42  40  80  45
3  42  40  76   2  91  19  57
4  57  57  24  29  26  66  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. Considering the valuations, we can try to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 3 with a value of 98. Let's allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has the highest value for item 0 with a value of 67, which is the highest among all agents for that item. Let's allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 5 with a value of 80. Let's allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has the highest value for item 4 with a value of 91. Let's allocate item 4 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent has the highest value for item 6 with a value of 84. Let's allocate item 6 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items to ensure all items are allocated fairly:

6. **Remaining Items (1 and 2)**:
   - For item 1, agent 0 values it the most (42), so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
   - For item 2, agent 3 values it at 76, which is high. Let's allocate item 2 to agent 3.

Finally, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 2],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to an agent and attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.
