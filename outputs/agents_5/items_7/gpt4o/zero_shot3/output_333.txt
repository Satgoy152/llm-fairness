Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  53  44  11  83  74  36  34
1   8  20  22  40  54  28  87
2  31  82  44  39  52  48  60
3  28  19  65  68  93  93  49
4  91  23  68  42  16  65  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 44 11 83 74 36 34]
 [ 8 20 22 40 54 28 87]
 [31 82 44 39 52 48 60]
 [28 19 65 68 93 93 49]
 [91 23 68 42 16 65 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent and that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's an allocation that attempts to balance these considerations:

1. Assign items based on the highest individual valuations.
2. Ensure each agent gets a reasonable share.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5
- Agent 3: Items 2, 3
- Agent 4: No items

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": []
}
```

This distribution respects the constraints and attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
