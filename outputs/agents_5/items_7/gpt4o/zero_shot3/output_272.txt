Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  82   8  74   7  55  96
1  47  44  81  95   1  38  91
2  75  83  11  50  98  20  96
3  75  68  38  80  48  79  80
4  91  55  79  98  14  90  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are distributed.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 the most (value of 96).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (value of 95).
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (value of 98).
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most (value of 79).
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the most (value of 91).

Now, we look at the remaining unallocated items (1 and 2) and assign them to agents who value them relatively higher compared to others:

- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 2, who values it at 83.
- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 4, who values it at 79.

This ensures that all items are allocated and that each agent gets at least one item. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
