Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  80  82  30  70  49  21
1  52  57   9   3  56  41  96
2  18  14  99  91  21  25  42
3   9  71  55  42  48  21  30
4  62  10  98  78  64  45  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 7 items allocated in total.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:**
   We allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This method aims to maximize overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

2. **Allocation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it most at 73.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it most at 80.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it most at 99.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it most at 91.
   - Item 4: Agent 4 values it most at 64.
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it most at 49.
   - Item 6: Agent 1 values it most at 96.

3. **Resulting Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 receives items [0, 1, 5].
   - Agent 1 receives item [6].
   - Agent 2 receives items [2, 3].
   - Agent 3 receives no items.
   - Agent 4 receives item [4].

Below is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents according to their highest valuations.
