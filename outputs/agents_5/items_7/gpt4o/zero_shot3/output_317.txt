Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  30  47  44  64  87  29
1  36  57  94  82  96  81  49
2  75   9  86  74  95  50   0
3  27  80  19  43   0  78  60
4  53  88  51   7  69  51  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [53 88 51  7 69 51 36]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's the valuation table for reference:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  30  47  44  64  87  29
1  36  57  94  82  96  81  49
2  75   9  86  74  95  50   0
3  27  80  19  43   0  78  60
4  53  88  51   7  69  51  36
```

Let's attempt a fair allocation based on the valuation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. In case of ties, assign based on fair distribution among agents.

Here are the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (value 75)
- Item 1: Agent 4 (value 88)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (value 94)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (value 82)
- Item 4: Agent 1 (value 96)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (value 87)
- Item 6: Agent 3 (value 60)

This allocation gives us:

- Agent 0: 1 item
- Agent 1: 3 items
- Agent 2: 1 item
- Agent 3: 1 item
- Agent 4: 1 item

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
