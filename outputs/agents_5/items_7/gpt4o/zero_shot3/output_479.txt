Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  45  17   0   6  13  93
1  76  66  23  23  63  12  36
2  72  27  32   1  27  92  78
3  87  59  39  97   6  97  37
4  12   4   9  36   9  90  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize their satisfaction. This can be done by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly, while also distributing the total items evenly.

Here's a possible fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has a high value for item 6.
2. Agent 1 has a high value for item 0 and item 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high value for item 5.
4. Agent 3 has a high value for item 3 and item 5.
5. Agent 4 doesn't have high values compared to others, but can take item 4.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 4

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, with a balanced distribution based on their valuations.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
