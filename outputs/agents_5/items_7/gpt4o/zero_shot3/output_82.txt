Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  15  14  77  11  79  85
1  36   5  60  36  34  14  47
2  99  30  35  12  89  45  82
3  68   8  60  76  74  21  95
4  72  11  28  52  41  16   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the sum of the allocated values for each agent, while ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the constraints, let's find a reasonable allocation.

First, let's analyze the highest value each agent has for any item:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 85.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 60.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 99.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest at 95.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest at 72.

Next, we try to allocate items to maximize these high valuations while ensuring all items are allocated:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (highest valuation at 99).
2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation at 60).
3. Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 (highest valuation at 95).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation at 15 after item 6).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 4 (next highest valuation at 41).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation at 79 after item 6).
7. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation at 76 after item 6).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total value for each agent is reasonably high. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
