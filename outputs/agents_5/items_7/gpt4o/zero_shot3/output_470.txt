Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25   2  67  28  76  19  77
1  17  96  22  29  68  32  16
2  58  58  92  45  18  25  97
3  99  66  90  27   6  63  62
4  91  15  52  86  67  36  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 96 22 29 68 32 16]
 [58 58 92 45 18 25 97]

 [91 15 52 86 67 36 68]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated equals 7. Let's consider the valuations and allocate items in a way that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (77).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (96).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (92).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (99).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (86).

After assigning these items, we have two items left to allocate (4 and 5). Let's assign these in a way that further balances the allocation:

- Agent 1 also values item 4 highly (68), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 higher than the remaining agents, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated.
