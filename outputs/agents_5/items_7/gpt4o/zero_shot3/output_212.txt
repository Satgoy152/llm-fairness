Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  41  69  78   6  42  20  62
1  83  26  75  43  98  93  62
2  44  49  63   2  85  22  36
3  76   8   0  89  43  28  11
4   2  91  29  11  73  13  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. One approach is to look for the highest valuations and try to allocate items accordingly while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (Value = 78)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (Value = 98)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (already allocated), next highest is Item 2 (already allocated), then Item 0 (Value = 44)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (Value = 89)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (Value = 91)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 4.

Next, we allocate the remaining items 5 and 6:
- Item 5: Agent 1 has a high valuation (93), Agent 0 has a lower valuation (20)
  - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.
- Item 6: Agent 0 has a high valuation (62), followed by Agent 1 (62)
  - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute items based on preferences while ensuring each item is allocated.
