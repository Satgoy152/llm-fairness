Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  64   9  95  86  48  49
1  20  86  68  55  61  81  89
2  86  19  82   7  49  31  61
3  88   0  57  54   2  86   9
4  41  32  43  42  68  42  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7. Considering the given valuations, a strategy could be to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's analyze the table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 88     | 64     | 9      | 95     | 86     | 48     | 49     |
| 1     | 20     | 86     | 68     | 55     | 61     | 81     | 89     |
| 2     | 86     | 19     | 82     | 7      | 49     | 31     | 61     |
| 3     | 88     | 0      | 57     | 54     | 2      | 86     | 9      |
| 4     | 41     | 32     | 43     | 42     | 68     | 42     | 84     |

To determine the allocations, let's assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 and Agent 3 both have a valuation of 88. We choose Agent 0 for this allocation.
- **Item 1**: The highest valuation is 86 by Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 82 by Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 95 by Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 86 by Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: The highest valuation is 86 by Agent 3.
- **Item 6**: The highest valuation is 89 by Agent 1.

According to the above allocations, Agent 0 is over-allocated. To ensure fairness and that every agent receives at least one item, let's adjust the allocations:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 4 (since Agent 0 is over-allocated, and Agent 4 is the next highest at 68).
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 3.
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has a high valuation for this item).

This allocation ensures every agent receives at least one item and all items are fairly distributed.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```
