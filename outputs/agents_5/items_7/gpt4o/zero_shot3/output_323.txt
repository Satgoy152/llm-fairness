Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  42  89  27  54  95  24
1  73  29  25  86  38  90  68
2   4  13  10   8  57  36  25
3  84  87  98  59  63  49  59
4  57  12  13  86   4  16  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51 42 89 27 54 95 24]
 [73 29 25 86 38 90 68]
 [ 4 13 10  8 57 36 25]
 [84 87 98 59 63 49 59]
 [57 12 13 86  4 16 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the table of valuations, we can use a strategy to allocate items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocate item 5 (value 95) to maximize their high valuation.
2. Agent 1: Allocate item 3 (value 86) to maximize their high valuation.
3. Agent 2: Allocate item 4 (value 57) to maximize their high valuation.
4. Agent 3: Allocate item 2 (value 98) to maximize their high valuation.
5. Agent 4: Allocate item 0 (value 57) to maximize their high valuation.
6. Agent 1: Allocate item 6 (value 68) as the next highest available.
7. Agent 0: Allocate item 1 (value 42) to fill the remaining slot.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and utilizes high valuations where possible.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
