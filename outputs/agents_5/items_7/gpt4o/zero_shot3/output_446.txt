Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  72  48  38  79  56  70
1  63  32  24  29  79  47  12
2  14  42  34   5   9  84  26
3  38  86  51  71  80  86  70
4  73  33  42  47  58  54   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them the items they value most, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 can be assigned item 1, which they value highly at 72.
2. Agent 1 can be assigned item 4, which is their highest valued item at 79.
3. Agent 2 can be assigned item 5, which is their highest valued item at 84.
4. Agent 3 can be assigned item 3, which is one of their highest valued items at 71.
5. Agent 4 can be assigned item 0, which is one of their highest valued items at 73.
6. Agent 3 can also be assigned item 6, which they value at 70.
7. Agent 0 can also be assigned item 2, which they value at 48.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item they value highly.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
