Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  67   1  14  40  12  50
1  67  97  93   6  30  45  52
2  95  79  88  16  19  89  58
3  47  58  84  30  48  51  51
4  10  71  75  32  82  52  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuation of the items and aims to maximize the overall satisfaction or value. One approach is to allocate items greedily based on the highest value an agent assigns to an item, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 (value 67).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - The highest value for Agent 1 is item 1 (value 97), but it is already allocated.
   - Next highest value is item 2 (value 93).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - The highest value for Agent 2 is item 0 (value 95).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - The highest value for Agent 3 is item 2 (value 84), but it is already allocated.
   - Next highest value is item 1 (value 58), but it is already allocated.
   - Next highest is item 6 (value 51).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - The highest value for Agent 4 is item 4 (value 82).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items (3 and 5):

6. **Remaining items:**
   - Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 4 (value 32), but Agent 4 already has an item.
   - Next highest for item 3 is Agent 3 (value 30).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

7. **Last item:**
   - Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 2 (value 89), but Agent 2 already has an item.
   - Next highest for item 5 is Agent 4 (value 52).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
