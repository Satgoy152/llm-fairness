Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  66   2  12  28  46  63
1  61  54  77  16  80  82  64
2  46  10  75  51   6  18  66
3  55  41  48  59  40  11  95
4   6   0  32  16  53  91  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize their satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Given there are 5 agents and 7 items, several approaches can be considered, such as maximizing the total value or ensuring that each agent gets their most valued item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Allocate each agent their highest-valued item, if possible.
2. Distribute remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's go through the steps:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is 66 for item 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is 82 for item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is 75 for item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is 95 for item 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is 91 for item 5, but it's already taken, so take the next highest which is 91 for item 6, but it's also taken. Next, take item 5 which has already been allocated, so take item 4 with a value of 53, which is the highest remaining for Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated the following: 
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [4]

We still have items 0 and 3 to allocate. Let's allocate these based on the next highest values:

- Agent 0 has item 0 as the next highest value (65).
- Agent 3 has item 3 as the next highest value (59).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.
