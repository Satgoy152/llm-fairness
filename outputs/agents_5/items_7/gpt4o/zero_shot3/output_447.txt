Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  18  62  69  18  92  86
1  21   7  93  41  40  23  22
2  76   1   4  46  71  48  50
3  49   8  64  53  11  36  20
4  51  15   5   3  35  49  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. We can approach this by considering each agent's valuations and trying to distribute the items such that overall satisfaction or value is maximized.

### Step-by-step Allocation:
1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 5 (92) and 6 (86).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (93).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 (76) and item 4 (71).
   - Agent 3 values item 2 (64) and item 3 (53).
   - Agent 4 values item 6 (65) and item 5 (49).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Values:**
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1 (highest value 93).
   - Assign item 5 to agent 0 (highest value 92).
   - Assign item 0 to agent 2 (highest value 76).
   - Assign item 6 to agent 4 (highest value 65).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Item 1: Assign to agent 0 (value 18) as agent 0 hasn't reached a fair share, and it increases total value.
   - Item 3: Assign to agent 3 (value 53) as itâ€™s the highest remaining value for a remaining item.
   - Item 4: Assign to agent 2 (value 71) as it increases their total value significantly.

4. **Check Fairness and Completeness:**
   - Each agent has received items and all 7 items have been allocated.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated.
