Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  56   0  96  56   7  46
1  70  64  64  67  97  28  56
2  60  76  25   9   0  11  40
3  61   8  26  23  94  10  18
4  23  44  69  94  42  80  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives or ensure each agent gets at least one high-value item, depending on the fairness criteria we choose. Here, we will try to allocate items such that each agent gets at least one item they value relatively highly.

Let's begin by analyzing the highest valuations for each agent and attempt to allocate items accordingly.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (value 96).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 97).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 76).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 94). We need to find a secondary item since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (value 94). However, item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we need to find a secondary option.

Now let's assign items based on these considerations while ensuring every agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (value 96)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (value 97)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (value 76)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (value 61) - next highest available valuation
- Agent 4: Item 5 (value 80) - next highest available valuation

Remaining items (2 and 6) need to be assigned, considering remaining valuations.

- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (value 69)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 46)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with each agent receiving items they value relatively highly.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 5 agents, and each agent receives at least one item.
