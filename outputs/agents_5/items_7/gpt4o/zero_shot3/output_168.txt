Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  40  42  47  83  18  71
1  99   1  90  71  20   1  89
2  55  79   4  28  47  64  68
3  42   2  40  48  73  82  99
4  86  51   1  69  26  22  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed. We can utilize a simple greedy approach, allocating items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 0 (99) more than any other agent, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 4** highly values item 1 (51) more than any other agent, so allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
3. **Agent 1** also highly values item 2 (90), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 1** also highly values item 3 (71), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (83), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (82), so allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
7. **Agent 3** also highly values item 6 (99), so allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

Now, let's check if each agent has at least one item and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0: item 4
- Agent 1: items 0, 2, 3
- Agent 2: no items
- Agent 3: items 5, 6
- Agent 4: item 1

Agent 2 has no items, so we need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness. Let's reallocate item 2 to Agent 2, which Agent 1 had.

Revised allocation:

1. **Agent 0** gets item 4.
2. **Agent 1** gets items 0, 3.
3. **Agent 2** gets item 2.
4. **Agent 3** gets items 5, 6.
5. **Agent 4** gets item 1.

Now, every agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
