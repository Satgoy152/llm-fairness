Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  33  92  20  32  43   3
1  30  58   1  83  85  89  18
2  58  61  45  86  39  59  53
3  90  21  78  27   1  37  18
4   3   8   3   9  78  87  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction. This involves assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes their individual valuations.

Here's a fair allocation based on the given table:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation each agent has for any item.
2. Assign items to agents based on these valuations, ensuring each item is assigned only once and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 4.

Now, let's assign the items based on these valuations:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to agent 4.
- Assign item 6 to agent 4 (since agent 4 values item 6 higher than others).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated.
