Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  74  36  83   2  68  88
1  97  86  66  40  26  46  12
2  73  95  95  29  23  37   3
3  38  63  58   7   2  80  29
4  95   1  46  14  69  66  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to assign items to agents such that the overall satisfaction is maximized, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 7 items are allocated in total.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 6 highly (88), followed by item 3 (83).
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (97), followed by item 1 (86).
- Agent 2 values items 1 and 2 equally (95).
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly (80).
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly (95), followed by item 4 (69).

We will attempt to allocate items based on these observations:

1. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0. Value = 88
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2. Value = 95
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1. Value = 97
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3. Value = 80
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 4. Value = 69
6. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0. Value = 83
7. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2. Value = 95

Now each agent receives at least one item, and all 7 items are distributed. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```
