Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  22  32  29  71  96  11
1  56  60  95  27  23  31  36
2  87  45  99  65  95   7  96
3  88  78  50  63  94  50  76
4  12  95  97  29  59  19  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: Evaluate the highest valued item for Agent 0. The highest value is 96 for item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**: Evaluate the highest valued item for Agent 1. The highest value is 95 for item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**: Evaluate the highest valued item for Agent 2. The highest value is 99 for item 2, but it's already taken. The next highest is 96 for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Evaluate the highest valued item for Agent 3. The highest value is 94 for item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Evaluate the highest valued item for Agent 4. The highest value is 97 for item 2, but it's already taken. The next highest is 95 for item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 4.

6. Now, we have items 0 and 3 left unallocated. We will assign these remaining items to the agents with the next highest preferences:

   - **Agent 2**: The highest remaining preference is for item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
   - **Agent 3**: The highest remaining preference is for item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent has been assigned items, and all items have been allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
