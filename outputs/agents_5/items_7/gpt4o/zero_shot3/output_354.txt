Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81   5  23   0  92  68  56
1  11  28  84  35  98  13  25
2   3  84  69  95  15  57  52
3   6  73   8  65  26  89   7
4  99  23  93   8  85  36   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation. A common approach is to try and allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Hereâ€™s one way to approach this:

1. For each item, identify the agent who has the highest valuation for that item.
2. Allocate the item to that agent if they haven't already received an item or if they have less than others, considering fairness in the distribution.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items based on the table given:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most at 99.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 84.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most at 93.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 98.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most at 89.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 56.

Ensuring fairness, we might need to adjust slightly to ensure each agent gets at least one item. Given the current allocation, Agent 0 hasn't received any item. Let's try to adjust:

Re-evaluating the allocations to ensure fairness:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 instead of Agent 4.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, ensuring Agent 0 gets an item.

This results in:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and fairly distributes the items based on their valuations. There are 7 items allocated in total.
