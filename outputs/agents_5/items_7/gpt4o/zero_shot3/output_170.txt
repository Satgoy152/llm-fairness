Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55   7  79  33  57  82   4
1  33  92  53  38   1   1  78
2  89  88  89  65  69  28   1
3  25  16  21  65  28   0   4
4  73  63  92  39  76  81  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 82. Let's assign item 5 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 92. Let's assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values items 0, 2 the highest at 89 each. Assign item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has relatively low valuations, and their highest valuation is for item 3 at 65. Assign item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 2 the highest at 92. Assign item 2 to agent 4.

Now, we must ensure that all 7 items are allocated. Let's check the remaining items and allocate them:

- Item 4: Not yet allocated. Agent 4 values it at 76, which is the highest among the remaining valuations for this item. Assign item 4 to agent 4.

- Item 6: Not yet allocated. Agent 1 values it at 78, which is the highest remaining valuation. Assign item 6 to agent 1.

This ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent has an integer number of items. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
