Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  48  73  71  26  29  26
1  57  76  97  52  13  50  35
2  12  36  53  58   8   8  71
3  46  87  81  64  49  44  10
4  68   8  25  58  96  46  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that considers the agents' valuations. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Let's start by iterating through each item and assigning it to the agent who values it the most and who hasn't already been assigned an item. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Item 0 (values: [51, 57, 12, 46, 68]) is allocated to Agent 4 (highest value: 68).
2. Item 1 (values: [48, 76, 36, 87, 8]) is allocated to Agent 3 (highest value: 87).
3. Item 2 (values: [73, 97, 53, 81, 25]) is allocated to Agent 1 (highest value: 97).
4. Item 3 (values: [71, 52, 58, 64, 58]) is allocated to Agent 0 (highest value: 71).
5. Item 4 (values: [26, 13, 8, 49, 96]) is allocated to Agent 4 (highest value: 96).
6. Item 5 (values: [29, 50, 8, 44, 46]) is allocated to Agent 1 (highest value: 50).
7. Item 6 (values: [26, 35, 71, 10, 88]) is allocated to Agent 2 (highest value: 71).

Now, presenting the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, maximizing the values according to the given table.
