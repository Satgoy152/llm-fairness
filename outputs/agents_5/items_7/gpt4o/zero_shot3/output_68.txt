Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  71  28  51  21   1  96
1  67  10   8  80   9  98  59
2  32  41  44  87  22  53  38
3  34  76  44   8  73  35  23
4  79  67  63   0  61  46  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[60 71 28 51 21  1 96]
 [67 10  8 80  9 98 59]
 [32 41 44 87 22 53 38]

 [79 67 63  0 61 46 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to ensure that each agent gets items that maximize their valuations while also ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. We'll aim for a balanced distribution based on the given table:

```
Agent 0: 60, 71, 28, 51, 21, 1, 96
Agent 1: 67, 10, 8, 80, 9, 98, 59
Agent 2: 32, 41, 44, 87, 22, 53, 38
Agent 3: 34, 76, 44, 8, 73, 35, 23
Agent 4: 79, 67, 63, 0, 61, 46, 63
```

A possible allocation could be:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 96)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 98)
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (value 87)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 73)
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (value 79)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 76)
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (value 63)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the total valuation for each agent as much as possible given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 1],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
