Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  91  49  19  68  84  40
1  87   6  57  59   4  17  50
2  70  65  54  70   4  69  53
3  17  31  68   4  52   1  67
4  77   0  70  74  53  80  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the agents' valuations of the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no agent is left with no items if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0: 11
  - Agent 1: 87
  - Agent 2: 70
  - Agent 3: 17
  - Agent 4: 77

  Highest value: Agent 1 (87)

- Item 1: 
  - Agent 0: 91
  - Agent 1: 6
  - Agent 2: 65
  - Agent 3: 31
  - Agent 4: 0

  Highest value: Agent 0 (91)

- Item 2: 
  - Agent 0: 49
  - Agent 1: 57
  - Agent 2: 54
  - Agent 3: 68
  - Agent 4: 70

  Highest value: Agent 4 (70)

- Item 3: 
  - Agent 0: 19
  - Agent 1: 59
  - Agent 2: 70
  - Agent 3: 4
  - Agent 4: 74

  Highest value: Agent 4 (74)

- Item 4: 
  - Agent 0: 68
  - Agent 1: 4
  - Agent 2: 4
  - Agent 3: 52
  - Agent 4: 53

  Highest value: Agent 0 (68)

- Item 5: 
  - Agent 0: 84
  - Agent 1: 17
  - Agent 2: 69
  - Agent 3: 1
  - Agent 4: 80

  Highest value: Agent 0 (84)

- Item 6: 
  - Agent 0: 40
  - Agent 1: 50
  - Agent 2: 53
  - Agent 3: 67
  - Agent 4: 30

  Highest value: Agent 3 (67)

Now let's allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 gets items 1, 4, 5
- Agent 1 gets item 0
- Agent 2 gets no items
- Agent 3 gets item 6
- Agent 4 gets items 2, 3

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```
