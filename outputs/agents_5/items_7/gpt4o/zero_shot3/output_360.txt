Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  67  57  15   1  56  36
1  92   1  64  19  51  13  63
2  66  43   6   2  32  21  46
3  63  13  79  33  86  20  94
4  74   5   2   2  31   1   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm, where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more items than others until all items are distributed.

Let's step through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0** is valued highest by Agent 1 (92).
2. **Item 1** is valued highest by Agent 0 (67).
3. **Item 2** is valued highest by Agent 3 (79).
4. **Item 3** is valued highest by Agent 3 (33).
5. **Item 4** is valued highest by Agent 3 (86).
6. **Item 5** is valued highest by Agent 0 (56).
7. **Item 6** is valued highest by Agent 3 (94).

After this initial greedy allocation, Agent 3 ends up with too many items. We need to reallocate to balance the distribution:

- Reallocate Item 3 from Agent 3 to Agent 1 (second-highest value for Item 3).
- Reallocate Item 4 from Agent 3 to Agent 2 (second-highest value for Item 4).
- Reallocate Item 6 from Agent 3 to Agent 0 (second-highest value for Item 6).

This gives us a more balanced allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: No items

Here's the final JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```
