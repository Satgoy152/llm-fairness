Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  18  70  43  15  73  28
1  21  91  49  49  39  54  34
2  99  26  71  69  21  33  31
3  96  54  45  71  84   2   9
4   8  90  57  75   4  60  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations are for item 5 (73) and item 2 (70).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (91).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (99).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (96), but since item 0 is better valued by agent 2, we look at the next highest: item 4 (84).

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuation is for item 3 (75).

By allocating based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent has a fair opportunity to receive items, we can distribute items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (valuation 73).
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (valuation 91).
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (valuation 99).
- Agent 3 gets item 4 (valuation 84).
- Agent 4 gets item 3 (valuation 75).

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 2 and 6:

- Item 2 can go to Agent 0, who also values it highly (70).
- Item 6 can be allocated to Agent 1, who values it moderately (34).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
