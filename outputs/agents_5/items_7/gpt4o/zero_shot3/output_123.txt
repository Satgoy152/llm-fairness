Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  28  13  84  23  47   2
1  92  89  97   8   0  28  22
2  37  82  63  10   2  20  54
3  20  72  80  17  25  20  62
4  59  95  20  93  81  14  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the individual satisfaction of each agent by assigning items based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items, while also keeping the total number of items allocated to exactly 7.

Here is one possible allocation that attempts to maximize the agents' satisfaction:

- Agent 0: Since agent 0 values item 3 highly (84), we can assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1: Agent 1 highly values item 2 (97), so we assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2: Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1 (82), so item 1 goes to agent 2.
- Agent 3: Agent 3 values item 6 (62) highly, so we allocate item 6 to agent 3.
- Agent 4: Agent 4 values item 4 (81) and item 0 (59). We can assign items 4 and 0 to agent 4.

Now, let's check if all items are allocated:
- Item 0: Allocated to agent 4
- Item 1: Allocated to agent 2
- Item 2: Allocated to agent 1
- Item 3: Allocated to agent 0
- Item 4: Allocated to agent 4
- Item 5: Not allocated yet
- Item 6: Allocated to agent 3

We still have item 5 remaining. Since agent 0 currently has only one item, we can assign item 5 to agent 0 to balance the allocation a bit more.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
