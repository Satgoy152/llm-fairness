Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  83  77  75  73  49  86
1  78  21  39  17  21  23  35
2  93  66  57  11  68  51  60
3  83  18  87  50  69  18  29
4  60  62  61  33  54  44   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow an approach that maximizes each agent's happiness with their allocation while ensuring that every item is assigned and each agent gets at least one item. We can start by assigning the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are eventually allocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Item 0** is valued the highest by Agent 2 (93).
2. **Item 1** is valued the highest by Agent 0 (83).
3. **Item 2** is valued the highest by Agent 3 (87).
4. **Item 3** is valued the highest by Agent 0 (75).
5. **Item 4** is valued the highest by Agent 3 (69).
6. **Item 5** is valued the highest by Agent 0 (49).
7. **Item 6** is valued the highest by Agent 0 (86).

After assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 5, 6
- Agent 1: 
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4
- Agent 4: 

Since Agent 1 and Agent 4 currently have no items, we need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness. We can redistribute some items while still considering fairness:

- Reassign Item 4 from Agent 3 to Agent 1, as it provides Agent 1 with an item and Agent 3 still retains Item 2.
- Reassign Item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 4, to ensure Agent 4 also receives an item.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 6
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 5

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```
