Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  12   4  13  96  42  50
1  92  64  94  15  24  65  53
2  30  72  51  48  93  84  53
3  26  66  76  90   9  52  31
4  18  51   7  82  37  56  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the total number of allocated items equals 7. One potential approach is to assign items based on maximizing the total valuations for each agent, while ensuring fairness in distribution.

Let's allocate items to agents based on their valuations:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0 because it has the highest valuation (96).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1 because it has the highest valuation (94).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 2 because it has the highest valuation (84).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 because it has the highest valuation (90).
5. Assign item 1 to agent 2 because it has a high valuation (72) and agent 2 only has one item so far.
6. Assign item 0 to agent 1 because it has a high valuation (92) and agent 1 only has one item so far.
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 because it has a high valuation (50) and agent 0 only has one item so far.

Now, each agent has been assigned items based on their valuations:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 0]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 1]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: No items

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": []
}
```
