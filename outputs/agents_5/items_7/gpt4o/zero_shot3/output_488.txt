Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  33  11  62  82  21  80
1  85  14  23  29  66  39  15
2  94   5   9  64  91  40   6
3  79  19  26  53  69   1  47
4   0  81  25  53   2  95  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common approach is to use a greedy allocation method, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's go through the allocations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 94.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 81.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 11.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 62.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 82.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 95.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 96.

To ensure everyone gets at least one item, we can adjust the allocation as needed:

- Agent 2 gets Item 0.
- Agent 4 gets Item 1 and Item 6.
- Agent 0 gets Item 2 and Item 4.
- Agent 1 gets Item 3.
- Agent 3 gets Item 5.

Let's ensure the allocation is valid with each agent receiving at least one item:

- Agent 0: [2, 4]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [1, 6]

This allocation ensures all items are assigned, each agent receives at least one item, and the assignment is fair based on the highest value each agent places on the items they receive.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```
