Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  30  74  84   6  93  14
1  82  17  78  73   6  95  72
2  42  13  48  31  68  50  18
3  33  14  14  24  78  25  91
4  15   7  91  99  33  37  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. One possible approach is to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (value 93)
   - Second highest: Item 3 (value 84)
   - Allocate item 5 and 3 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (value 95)
   - But Item 5 is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next highest: Item 0 (value 82)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (value 68)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 6 (value 91)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (value 99)
   - But Item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Next highest: Item 2 (value 91)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 4

Now we only have item 1 left to allocate:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (value 30) is the next highest available for Agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

This allocation method ensures that each agent gets at least one item (except when not possible due to fewer items than agents) and tries to respect the highest valuations possible.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```
