Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  34  87  32  17  31  55
1  30   2   6  53  70  56  46
2  23  77   3  31  94  57  40
3  60  68  38  19  16  11  37
4  37  38  71   1   1  31  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[92 34 87 32 17 31 55]
 [30  2  6 53 70 56 46]
 [23 77  3 31 94 57 40]
 [60 68 38 19 16 11 37]
 [37 38 71  1  1 31 56]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 7.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (92) and 2 (87).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (70) and 5 (56).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (94) and 1 (77).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (68) and 0 (60).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (71) and 6 (56).

We'll try to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each item is only allocated to one agent and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 2 (total valuation: 92 + 87 = 179)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (total valuation: 56)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (total valuation: 94)
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 1 and 6 (total valuation: 68 + 37 = 105)
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 3 (total valuation: 1)

This allocation covers all 7 items and tries to respect the highest valuations for each agent.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
