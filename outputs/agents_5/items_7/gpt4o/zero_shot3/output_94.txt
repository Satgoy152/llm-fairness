Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  71  82  47   4  33  70
1  91   9  11  82  22  84  45
2  96  79  69   8  60  50  71
3  53  84  35  23  78  83  31
4  49   4   1   5  22  47  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that reasonably equates to the total value across agents.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 6. Let's allocate item 0, which has the highest valuation for this agent.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 highly. Let's allocate item 5 to this agent.

3. **Agent 2**: Item 0 is already allocated, but item 6 also holds a high value for this agent. Allocate item 6.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 highly. Allocate item 1 to this agent.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent's highest valuation is for item 6, which is already allocated. The next highest value is item 4. Allocate item 4.

Now, let's look at remaining items and remaining agents:

- Remaining items: 2, 3
- Remaining agents: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (since each needs at least one item)

Now, allocate the remaining items to maximize the value:

- **Item 2**: The highest remaining value for item 2 is for Agent 0. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

- **Item 3**: The highest remaining value for item 3 is for Agent 1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, the total number of items allocated is 7, and the distribution aims to maximize total value for each agent.
