Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40   0  66   2  30   9  50
1  78  17  23  38   2  46  14
2  24  11   1  37  50  21  85
3  86  69  47  32  61   2  18
4  60  40  77  81  17  20   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to ensure that each agent receives items in such a way that maximizes their total valuation, while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent seems to value item 0 highly. So, we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 0, but since it's already allocated, we can give them item 3 which they value next highest.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 highly. We allocate item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0, but since it is already taken, we can allocate item 1 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 3, but it's already taken. Next, we allocate item 2 to agent 4.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated:

- **Item 4**: It goes to Agent 2, who values it the highest among the remaining options.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values item 5 highly, so we allocate it to Agent 1.

Now, the allocation is complete with each item assigned to an agent. Below is the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
