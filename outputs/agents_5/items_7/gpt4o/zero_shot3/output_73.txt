Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  27  17  82  23   7  27
1   2   9  82  43  21  99  62
2  26  30  35  91  32  62   4
3  48  52  71   4  78  47  77
4  39  46  61  20  76  57  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction or utility, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent may receive an integer number of items. 

Here's a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 seems to value item 3 the highest (82). We can assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (99). Assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (91), but it's already taken by agent 0. The next highest for agent 2 is item 5, but it is taken by agent 1. The next highest is item 1 with a value of 30, which is not taken. Assign item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (78). Assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (76), but it's already taken by agent 3. The next highest is item 5, but it is already taken by agent 1. The next highest is item 2 with a value of 61, which is not taken. Assign item 2 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items and need to allocate 2 more items to ensure all 7 items are allocated. We can allocate the remaining items (0 and 6) based on remaining preferences:

6. Agent 0 values item 0 the next highest (58), and it's not taken. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
7. Agent 1 values item 6 the next highest (62), and it's not taken. Assign item 6 to agent 1.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, each agent is considered, and no item is assigned to more than one agent.
