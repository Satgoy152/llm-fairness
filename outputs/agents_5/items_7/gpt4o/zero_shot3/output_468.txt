Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  71  10  87  20   2  97
1  84  49  72  48  14  28  49
2  13  80  84  45  96  48  50
3  33  74  15  67  76  70  64
4  26  48   1  50  14  28  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations that each agent has for each item. We aim to maximize the total value for each agent and distribute the items in a manner that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a potential fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values the item 6 the most, so allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has relatively high value for item 2, allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the most, so allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the most, so allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Can be allocated items with lower cumulative valuation, such as item 1.

After this, we still need to allocate items 0 and 5. Let's allocate:

6. **Agent 0**: Also gets item 0, as they value it highly.
7. **Agent 3**: Gets item 5 since they have a higher valuation for it compared to other unallocated items.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
