Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  63  97  40  27  23   5
1   5   5  88  45  73   7  86
2  79  94  85  35  45  95  30
3   8  23  23  50  18  73  86
4  64  38  19  12  63  79  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. To achieve a fair allocation, we can consider the preferences of each agent for the items.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items as fairly as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 2 (97) and 1 (63).
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations for items 2 (88) and 6 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations for items 1 (94), 5 (95), and 2 (85).
4. **Agent 3**: High valuations for items 6 (86) and 5 (73).
5. **Agent 4**: High valuations for items 5 (79) and 0 (64).

Considering these preferences, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (highest valuation).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6 (second-highest valuation for agent 1).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 (highest valuation for agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 (relatively high valuation).
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 0 (highest valuation for agent 4).

Now, we have allocated 5 items. Let's allocate the remaining 2 items:

- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 1 (second-highest valuation).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 (next highest valuation).

Now, each item is allocated, and we have ensured a somewhat fair distribution based on valuations. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
