Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  41  24  27  84  40  90
1  34  15  70  48  27  71  83
2  79  14  57  41  89  87  30
3  89  86  11  76  27  98  62
4  76  59   5  33  37  65  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item if possible. We will try to distribute the items based on the highest value each agent places on them.

1. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (98), Item 0 (89), Item 1 (86)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 3.

2. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (89), Item 5 (87), Item 0 (79)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2.

3. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (90), Item 4 (84), Item 1 (41)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0.

4. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (70), Item 5 (71), Item 6 (83)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (76), Item 1 (59)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 4.

At this point, each agent has been allocated at least one item. Now, we allocate the remaining items to those who value them the most and have not yet received their high-value items:

6. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Item 1: Highest remaining valuation by Agent 3 (86)
   - Item 3: Highest remaining valuation by Agent 3 (76)

By this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is seven.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 1, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
