Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  21  16  76  31  39  64
1  46  47  65  79  47   4  64
2  21  43   7  39  15  92  79
3  36  47  77  79   0   2  14
4  44  78  38  98  22  89  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. One way to approach this is by considering each agent's highest-valued items and assigning them accordingly. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values for Agent 0 are item 0 (95) and item 3 (76). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 (79). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 5 (92). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 3 (79), which is already taken. The next highest is item 2 (77). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 3 (98), which is already taken. The next highest is item 6 (99). Assign item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated five items. Let's allocate the two remaining items based on the next highest values:

6. **Agent 0**: The next highest available item for Agent 0 is item 4 (31). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

7. **Agent 2**: The next highest available item for Agent 2 is item 6 (79), which is already taken. The next highest is item 1 (43). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

All items have now been allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6]
}
```
