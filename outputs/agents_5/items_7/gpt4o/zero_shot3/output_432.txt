Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  42   2  16  13  96   8
1   8  76  77  24  82  87   9
2   5  18  37  81  71  81  80
3  93  65  72  40  79  75  28
4  20  87  75  90  44  20  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider a method such as maximizing the overall happiness or equality in distribution based on the valuations provided by each agent. One approach is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, if possible, while also ensuring all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (96).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (77).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (80).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (93).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (90).

After these allocations, items 1 and 4 are left unallocated. We can assign them to agents who have a secondary high value for them:

- Agent 1 also values item 4 highly (82).
- Agent 4 also values item 1 highly (87).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, and each agent receives at least one item based on their preferences.
