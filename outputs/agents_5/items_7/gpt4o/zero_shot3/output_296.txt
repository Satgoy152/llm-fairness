Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  34  43  69   5  81  42
1  84  44  83  52  84  10  51
2  76  35  64  82  40  37  42
3  24   0   6   7   6  58  61
4  13  52  85  56  21  66  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation strategy:

1. Begin by considering each agent's highest valued items and attempt to allocate them in a way that balances the overall value received by each agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item to maintain fairness across distributions.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Following this strategy, here is one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items with the highest values for them, particularly item 5, which has the highest value for agent 0.
- Agent 1 receives item 4, which is highly valued by them and not as highly valued by others.
- Agent 2 receives item 3, which has a high value for them and is not particularly high for others.
- Agent 3 receives item 6, which is most highly valued by them compared to others.
- Agent 4 receives item 2, which is highly valued by them and not as critical for others.

Allocating the remaining items, 0 and 1, to balance the distribution:

- Agent 0 can receive item 0, given its moderately high value for them.
- Agent 4 can receive item 1, as it still maintains a reasonable distribution of values.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and exactly 7 items are allocated in total.
