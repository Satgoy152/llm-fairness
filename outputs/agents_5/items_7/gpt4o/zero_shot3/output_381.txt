Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  66  50  20  98  76   8
1  70  97  97   9  58  85  92
2  70  62  54  44  26  32   6
3  22  87  79  87  20  76  73
4   2  70  94  25  66  94  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for each item. Let's go through a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value is 98 for item 4.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values are 97 for items 1 and 2.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value is 70 for item 0.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values are 87 for items 1 and 3.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest values are 94 for items 2 and 5.
   - Since item 2 is already allocated, assign item 5 to agent 4.

At this point, the allocations are as follows:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [5]

We have allocated 5 items so far. Now, let's allocate the remaining 2 items (1 and 6):

6. **For item 1:**
   - Remaining agents who have not been allocated yet: Agent 0, Agent 2, Agent 4.
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation of 87, but agent 3 already has an item.
   - Next highest unallocated agent is Agent 4 with a valuation of 70.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 4.

7. **For item 6:**
   - Remaining agents who have not been allocated yet: Agent 1.
   - Agent 1 has a valuation of 92 for item 6.
   - Assign item 6 to agent 1.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [2, 6]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [5, 1]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 1]
}
```
