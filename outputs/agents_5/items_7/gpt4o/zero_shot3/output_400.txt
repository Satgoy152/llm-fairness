Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  54  16  94  94  67  31
1  26  50  87  29  96  19  39
2  63  69  41  24  16  49  53
3  90  42   1  30  67  52  72
4  54  97  79  63  20  70  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction. One approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that have high personal valuation to them, while also ensuring every item is allocated exactly once and fairness is maintained.

Let's go through a possible allocation step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a high valuation for item 3 (94) and item 4 (94). Assign them both.

2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 4 (96) but item 4 is already taken. The next highest is item 2 (87). Assign item 2.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is item 1 (69). Assign item 1.

4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 0 (90) since it has the highest valuation for agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 5 (70) since it is the highest value left for agent 4.

Finally, we need to allocate the remaining item:

6. **Agent 1**: Has a reasonable valuation for item 6 (39). Assign item 6 to agent 1.

The allocation of items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest available valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.
