Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  28  98  70  23   6  96
1  11  36  93  16  94  70  20
2  11   2  81  70  78   9  22
3  37  24  57   4  55  40   2
4  53  91  30  23  15  26  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total utility while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share. The goal is to allocate all 7 items, with each agent possibly receiving a different number of items.

Let's go through the valuations and try to allocate items in a way that seems fair:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 (98) and 6 (96).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (94) highly.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 2 (81) but not as high as Agent 0; however, they value item 4 (78) and item 3 (70).
4. **Agent 3** does not have exceptionally high valuations compared to others but has a relatively higher valuation for item 0 (37).
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 (91) the highest among all items.

Considering these observations, let's attempt a fair allocation:

- **Assign item 2 to Agent 0** due to their highest valuation.
- **Assign item 6 to Agent 0** since they value it highly and it complements item 2.
- **Assign item 4 to Agent 1** as they have the highest valuation for it.
- **Assign item 3 to Agent 2** since they have a high valuation for it and it fits well with their other preferences.
- **Assign item 1 to Agent 4** as they have the highest valuation for it.
- **Assign item 0 to Agent 3** since they have the highest relative valuation compared to their other options.
- **Assign item 5 to Agent 2** to balance their allocation and due to their reasonable valuation for it.

This allocation attempts to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that all 7 items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```
