Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  67  50  13  42  16  80
1  26   7  66  23  22  97   0
2  91  85  44  75   7  98  86
3  29  54  77  67  66  68  59
4   4  52   5  77  38  60  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[29 67 50 13 42 16 80]
 [26  7 66 23 22 97  0]
 [91 85 44 75  7 98 86]
 [29 54 77 67 66 68 59]
 [ 4 52  5 77 38 60 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and no item is allocated to more than one agent. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 6. Let's allocate item 6 (value 80) to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5. Allocate item 5 (value 97) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0. Allocate item 0 (value 91) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 2 and 3. Allocate item 2 (value 77) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 3. Allocate item 3 (value 77) to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items 1 and 4 to the agents without items:

6. **Agent 0**, already with item 6, has the highest remaining valuation for item 1. Allocate item 1 (value 67) to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 3** has the highest remaining valuation for item 4. Allocate item 4 (value 66) to Agent 3.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
