Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  43  51  27  81  33  25
1  25  64  10  26  89  85  29
2  37  77  36  46  72  75  70
3  17  93  94  94   3  77  66
4  26  51  35  24  72  90  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives the items that they value the most, while also ensuring that all items are distributed. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most, while also ensuring each agent gets a fair share of total items.

2. Each agent should ideally end up with one or two items since there are 5 agents and 7 items.

Following this strategy, we can determine the allocation as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (81).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (85).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (77).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (94).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most (13).

Now, we have assigned five items to five agents. We need to allocate the remaining two items (0 and 3). Let's look at the remaining highest valuations:

- Item 0 is valued 57 by agent 0.
- Item 3 is valued 94 by agent 3.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [6]
}
```

In this allocation, agent 0 gets items 4 and 0, agent 1 gets item 5, agent 2 gets item 1, agent 3 gets items 2 and 3, and agent 4 gets item 6. This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that they value highly.
