Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  29  64  58  86  87  44
1  43  25  46  54  21  26  18
2  59  32  26  88  84  39   4
3  96  43  62  37  16  14  22
4  95  16  55  69  60  45  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and aim to maximize satisfaction. Given there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more than one item, while others may receive only one or none.

Here's a potential fair allocation:

1. Start by assigning items based on the highest valuations:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 0 (90).
   - Agent 3 highly values item 3 (37).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 4 (84).
   - Agent 4 highly values item 5 (45).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 2 (46).

2. Distribute remaining items to ensure each agent gets items:
   - Agent 0 can also take item 6 (44).
   - Agent 2 can take item 1 (32) as they value it more than others.

The final allocation of items to agents in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
