Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  92  88  60  82  55   4
1  21  46  36  10  33  82  29
2  19  94  72  52  38  51  94
3   7  57  62  92  44  52  49
4  86  21  89   6  54   1  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. The goal is to ensure that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and aim for a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 highly (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest value for item 5 (82).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 highly (94) and item 6 (94).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly (92).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 highly (89).

Now, let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (value 92).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (value 82).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 (value 94). Item 1 is already taken by Agent 0, so Agent 2 can take the next highest single item.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 (value 92).
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 2 (value 89).

After assigning these items, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items fairly:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 (value 82). This gives Agent 0 another high-value item.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 0 (value 21). This ensures Agent 1 gets an additional item even though it has a lower value.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all 7 items have been allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
