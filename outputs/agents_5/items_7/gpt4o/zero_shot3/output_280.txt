Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  58  97   4  16  79  42
1  35  96  73  88  91  14  59
2  98  89  53  83  97  81   3
3  68   4  89  45  18  57   4
4  56  87  71  24  80  61  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We'll aim to give each agent a roughly equal opportunity to get their most valued items, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. Identify each agent's highest value item and prioritize allocating these items.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, to maintain fairness.
3. Allocate remaining items to agents considering their second-highest valuations.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (97).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (96).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (98).
- Agent 3 values item 2 next highest (89), but it is already allocated to Agent 0. So, we look at their next preference, item 0 (68), but it's allocated to Agent 2. Then consider item 3 (45).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (88).

Allocate based on these priorities:
- Item 2 goes to Agent 0.
- Item 1 goes to Agent 1.
- Item 0 goes to Agent 2.
- Item 3 goes to Agent 3.
- Item 6 goes to Agent 4.

Next, allocate remaining items (4 and 5):
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly, so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 values item 5 highly, so assign item 5 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [0]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [6]

In JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated.
