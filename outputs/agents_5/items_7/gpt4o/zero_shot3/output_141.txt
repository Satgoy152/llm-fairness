Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  32  39   2  42  13   6
1  47  20  14  11  88  88  89
2  29   1  92  76  94  26   0
3  25  82  79   4  91  59  19
4  73   9  70  65   7  32  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total value, while ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 89)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 6 (value 89)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value 94)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value 82)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 5 (value 32)

Now, we allocate the remaining items 2 and 3:

- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (value 92)
- **Agent 4**: Item 3 (value 65)

This allocation aims to maximize the individual agents' satisfaction based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 3]
}
```
