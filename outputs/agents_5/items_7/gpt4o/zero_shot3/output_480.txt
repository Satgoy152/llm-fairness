Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  43  11  43  82  85  29
1  36  92  33  25  39  54  80
2  94   5  76  39  60  51  66
3  18  89   3  20  96  46   6
4  25  52  15  90  87   5  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and try to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Since we have 5 agents and 7 items, not every agent will receive the same number of items, but we aim for a balanced distribution.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: 85 (item 5)
   - Next highest: 82 (item 4)
   - Allocation: [4, 5]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: 92 (item 1)
   - Next highest: 80 (item 6)
   - Allocation: [1, 6]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: 94 (item 0)
   - Next highest: 76 (item 2)
   - Allocation: [0]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: 96 (item 4) - already taken
   - Next highest: 89 (item 1) - already taken
   - Next highest: 46 (item 5) - already taken
   - Allocation: []

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuation: 90 (item 3)
   - Next highest: 88 (item 6) - already taken
   - Allocation: [3]

Now, let's make sure each item is allocated and adjust if needed:

- Items 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 are allocated. Item 2 is not yet allocated.
- We need to allocate item 2. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 among unallocated items.

Revised allocations:

1. **Agent 0:** [5]
2. **Agent 1:** [1, 6]
3. **Agent 2:** [0, 2]
4. **Agent 3:** []
5. **Agent 4:** [3, 4]

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
