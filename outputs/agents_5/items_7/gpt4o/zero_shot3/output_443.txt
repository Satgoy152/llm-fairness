Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  85   8  27  95   9  36
1  23  27  35  93   8   9  42
2  42  75  10  70  22  19  76
3  40  80  92  40  72  54  64
4   7  39  94  16  59  13   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We need to make sure that all 7 items are allocated among the 5 agents. Here's one way to allocate them:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (95)
   - Allocation: [4]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (93)
   - Allocation: [3]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 6 (76)
   - Allocation: [6]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (92)
   - Allocation: [2]

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (39)
   - Additional item to ensure all items are allocated: Item 0 (7)
   - Allocation: [0, 1]

By following this allocation method, every agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
