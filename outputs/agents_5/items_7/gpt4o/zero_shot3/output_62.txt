Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  58  38  68  93  25  39
1  52  12  80  74  15  89  34
2  70  97  77  83  72  44  79
3  18  71  65  84   5  13  76
4  92   9  52  27  41  62  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach that considers the agents' valuations for each item and tries to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most, so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the most, so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the most, so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the most, so we allocate item 0 to agent 4.

Now, items 2 and 6 need to be allocated. We will allocate them based on the next highest values among the remaining agents:

6. Agent 2 values item 2 second highest, so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
7. Agent 3 values item 6 second highest, so we allocate item 6 to agent 3.

Now each agent has received an integer number of items, and all items have been allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
