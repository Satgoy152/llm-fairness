Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  19  64  18  90  67  53
1   8  44  24  31  14  38  79
2  67   4  94  83  20  56   5
3  24  45  64   2   4  46  63
4  75  49  85  95  79  83  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. One way to approach this is to assign items such that each agent gets an approximately equal share of their total valuation. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent.
2. Allocate items to maximize each agent's share of their total valuation, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has values: [59, 19, 64, 18, 90, 67, 53] with a total of 370.
- Agent 1 has values: [8, 44, 24, 31, 14, 38, 79] with a total of 238.
- Agent 2 has values: [67, 4, 94, 83, 20, 56, 5] with a total of 329.
- Agent 3 has values: [24, 45, 64, 2, 4, 46, 63] with a total of 248.
- Agent 4 has values: [75, 49, 85, 95, 79, 83, 66] with a total of 532.

After testing various allocations to balance fairness and maximize total value, a reasonable allocation might look like this:

- Allocate item 4 to agent 0 (value 90).
- Allocate items 1 and 6 to agent 1 (values 44 and 79).
- Allocate items 2 and 3 to agent 2 (values 94 and 83).
- Allocate item 5 to agent 3 (value 46).
- Allocate item 0 to agent 4 (value 75).

This allocation ensures every agent gets some value, and the total allocated items are 7.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```
