Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  94  20  97  18  90  38
1  91   5  90  27  55  95  26
2  89  97  72   7  73  69   7
3  86  11  31  35  17  81  16
4  13  53  92  37  24  25  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, I will use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction according to the provided valuations. I'll aim to give each agent at least one item, if possible, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (95).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (97).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (81), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 0 (86).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (92).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- **Remaining Items**: 4, 6
- **Agent 0**: Already has item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 5.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 1.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 0.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 2.

Now consider the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest available item is item 6 (38).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest available item is item 4 (55).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 5, 4
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 2

This ensures all items are allocated, and the allocations are as fair as possible based on the valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
