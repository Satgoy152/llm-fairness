Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  88  69  84  35  56  65
1  83  41  78  17  96  93  10
2  34  36  34  98  20  16  65
3  12  25  85  66  23  27  99
4  25  63  33  76   6  70  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the idea of maximizing total valuation or ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here, I'll try to allocate the items such that each agent is considered, and the total value is reasonably distributed.

To achieve this, we'll consider each agent's highest-valued items and distribute the items accordingly. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 3.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 4, 5, and 2.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 6.
5. Agent 4 can be given the remaining items.

After analyzing the values, here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 1, 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.
