Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  65  50  72  65  35   7
1  54  29  61   9  91  71   0
2  97   5  87  83  41  58  98
3   7  17  19  95  72  37  78
4  86  17  26  89  57  18  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. In this context, fairness might be interpreted as attempting to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent given the constraints.

Below is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for item 0 (88) and item 3 (72). We'll allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 (91). We'll allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 highly values item 6 (98). We'll allocate item 6 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 highly values item 3 (95). Since item 3 is not yet allocated, we'll allocate it to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 highly values item 0 (86), but since item 0 is already allocated, we look at the next highest valuation for agent 4, which is item 3 (89). However, item 3 is also allocated, so we choose item 5 (18) for agent 4.

6. **Remaining Items**:
   - Items 1, 2, and 5 are left. We will allocate them based on remaining high valuations:
     - Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1 (65). Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
     - Agent 2 values item 2 highly (87). Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
     - Agent 1 has a decent valuation for item 5 (71). Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

Finally, the items are allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 5.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 6.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives no items.
