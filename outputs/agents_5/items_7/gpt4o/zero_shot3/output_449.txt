Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  69  39   8  74  10  87
1  66  51  88  60  37  90   8
2  17  25   8  72  56  28   5
3  66  93  67  96  78  56  29
4  33   0  90  10   8  38  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets, ensuring each agent receives at least one item while maintaining the overall allocation constraint. Let's attempt to make the best allocation based on the given valuations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 6 (value 87).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 5 (value 90).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 3 (value 72).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 3 (value 96), but since it is already assigned to agent 2, we allocate the next highest, item 1 (value 93).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 2 (value 90).

After assigning these highest value items, we have allocated 5 of the 7 items. We still need to allocate 2 more items. Let's review the remaining unallocated items and their values:

- **Remaining items**: 0, 4
- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 55) is unallocated.
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (value 78) is unallocated.

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0, which has the highest remaining valuation for it.
- Assign item 4 to agent 3.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.
