Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  80  86   8  71   7  27
1  71   6  43  88  75  60  26
2   4   2  26  39  78  49   6
3  50  36  66  56  74  59  51
4  66  77  33   2  27  19  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation across all agents, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given that there are 7 items and 5 agents, at least 2 agents will need to receive more than one item. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) and fairness.

Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. We can assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, so we will assign item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has a relatively higher valuation for item 4. We'll assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has higher valuations for items 5 and 6, we can assign item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 1 highly, so we can assign item 1 to Agent 4.

Now we have assigned items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Items 0 and 6 are left to be allocated.

Let's distribute these remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0, which Agent 0 values highly.
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 6, which Agent 4 values decently.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.
