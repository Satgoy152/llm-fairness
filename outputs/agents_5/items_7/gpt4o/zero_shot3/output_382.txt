Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  47  90  65  95  24  88
1  64  31  51  36  48  26  16
2  98   5  74  97  52  33  80
3  65  49  77  33   9   4  58
4   9  40   5  51  87   0  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple allocation method that tries to give each agent the item they value the most, while ensuring that each item is allocated exactly once. In this scenario, there are 7 items and 5 agents, so some agents will receive more than one item.

We'll start by examining each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate them accordingly. If conflicts arise (multiple agents value the same item the highest), we'll resolve them by checking the next highest-valued item for one of the agents involved.

Here's one way we can fairly allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 4 (Value: 95)
   - Next highest: Item 2 (Value: 90)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (Value: 64)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (Value: 98) - Already allocated.
   - Next highest: Item 3 (Value: 97)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (Value: 77)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value: Item 4 (Value: 87) - Already allocated.
   - Next highest: Item 3 (Value: 51) - Already allocated.
   - Next highest: Item 1 (Value: 40)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 4.

After allocating the highest valued items, we still have two items left: 5 and 6. We can allocate them based on remaining unallocated items and remaining agents' preferences:

6. **Remaining items**:
   - Item 5:
     - Agent 0: Value 24
     - Agent 1: Value 26
     - Agent 2: Value 33
     - Agent 3: Value 4
     - Agent 4: Value 0
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2 (highest available value: 33).

7. **Remaining item**:
   - Item 6:
     - Agent 0: Value 88
     - Agent 1: Value 16
     - Agent 2: Value 80
     - Agent 3: Value 58
     - Agent 4: Value 43
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0 (highest available value: 88).

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
