Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  29  71  34  61  71   7
1  67  60  14  94   0  25  51
2  89  38  48  27   3  69  43
3  80  98  86  97  75  29  83
4  97  22  79  26   7   2  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will allocate the items based on each agent's highest valuation of the available items, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

Let's start by identifying the highest value each agent has for any item:

- Agent 0: Highest value is 71 for items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1: Highest value is 94 for item 3.
- Agent 2: Highest value is 89 for item 0.
- Agent 3: Highest value is 98 for item 1.
- Agent 4: Highest value is 97 for item 0.

Given these valuations, we can start the allocation process by giving each item to the agent who values it most. We'll resolve conflicts by considering remaining high-value options for the agents involved.

1. **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 4 (97) and Agent 2 (89). Assign to Agent 4.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 3 (98). Assign to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 0 (71). Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 1 (94). Assign to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 has the second-highest value (75), assign item 4 to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 0, as Agent 0 has already item 2 and both have the highest value for Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: The highest remaining value is by Agent 3 (83), assign to Agent 3.

After assigning the items, we have:

- Agent 0 has items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 has item 3.
- Agent 2 has no items.
- Agent 3 has items 1, 4, and 6.
- Agent 4 has item 0.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 4, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
