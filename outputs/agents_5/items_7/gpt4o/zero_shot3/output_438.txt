Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  17   0   8  96  71  49
1  63  13  37  38  58  49  93
2  59  43  62  19  49  63  52
3  56  86  94  95  92  28  94
4  50  77  35   0   0  79  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[95 17  0  8 96 71 49]
 [63 13 37 38 58 49 93]
 [59 43 62 19 49 63 52]
 [56 86 94 95 92 28 94]
 [50 77 35  0  0 79 65]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent and each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a potential allocation strategy based on maximizing individual agent's valuations for the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 4 (valuation 96).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 6 (valuation 93).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (valuation 62).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 (valuation 95).
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 5 (valuation 79).

Now, we have two items left (0 and 1) to assign among the agents. We will assign them to agents that gain the highest valuation from them:

6. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (valuation 95).
7. **Agent 4**: Assign item 1 (valuation 77).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, and each agent ends up with at least one item. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
