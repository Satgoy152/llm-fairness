Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  96  74  64  64  82  50
1  67  41  20  90  69  46  20
2  94  28  73  88  98  95  84
3  30  75  92  61  92  11  30
4  69  89  99   7  43  79  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the preferences of each agent based on their valuations for the items. A fair allocation should aim to give each agent a reasonable share of the total value based on their preferences.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest, so assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, so assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest, so assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the highest, so assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the highest, but since it's taken, assign item 5, which is the next highest valued item for agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 6:

6. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0, so assign item 0 to agent 2.
7. Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 6, so assign item 6 to agent 0.

The allocation can be represented in the required JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```
