Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  66  22  20   7  39   8
1   4  74  37  26  67  28   6
2  40  31  13  84  97  75  76
3  84  56   0  27  30  74  33
4  83   3   6  61  72  40  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that the total number of items allocated is 7 and each agent can receive zero or more items. A common approach to fair allocation is to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued item: 0 (value 69)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item: 1 (value 74)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued item: 4 (value 97)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valued item: 3 (value 27)
   - Second highest valued item: 5 (value 74)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valued item: 6 (value 31)

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 0
- Agent 1 gets item 1
- Agent 2 gets item 4
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 5
- Agent 4 gets item 6

Now, check the allocations to ensure all items are assigned:

- Items allocated: 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6

Missing item: 2

Let's assign this remaining item considering the next highest value:

- Agent 0 has item 2 with a value of 22
- Agent 1 has item 2 with a value of 37
- Agent 2 has item 2 with a value of 13
- Agent 3 has item 2 with a value of 0
- Agent 4 has item 2 with a value of 6

Assign item 2 to Agent 1 since they value it the highest among the remaining options.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [3, 5]
- Agent 4: [6]

The JSON allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [6]
}
```
