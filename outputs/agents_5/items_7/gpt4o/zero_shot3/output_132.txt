Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  91  38  63  65  16  69
1  26  62  98  26  46  20  91
2  85  57  45  30  39  38  73
3  49  11  93  28  72  57  78
4  58  79  48  63  61  93  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocations reflect a balance according to their valuations. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Assess the highest preferences**: Identify items that are valued highly by particular agents.
2. **Assign items according to highest preferences**: Allocate the items in a way that ensures a fair distribution based on these preferences.

After analyzing the valuations, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the second highest, but item 6 is a good fit.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 3, 4, 5

This ensures each agent receives items, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
