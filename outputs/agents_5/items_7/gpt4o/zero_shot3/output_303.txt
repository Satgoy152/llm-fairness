Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  25  15  55  51  90  18
1  69  90  86  20  77  85  83
2  10  38  28  82  22  65  23
3  72  45  44  51  80  19  75
4  52  85  43  29  71  18  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 72.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 90.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 86.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 82.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 80.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 90.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 83.

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most. Here are the allocations in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 2, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation, all 7 items are distributed among the agents, and each item is assigned to the agent who values it most highly based on the provided table. Agent 4 ends up with no items because their highest valuations are still lower than other agents' for the same items.
