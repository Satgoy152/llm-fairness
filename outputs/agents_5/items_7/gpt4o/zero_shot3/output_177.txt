Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  44  89  48  19  36  12
1  29  99  49  65  58  81  19
2  66  85  51  76  23  85  89
3  25   2  10   7  46  31  60
4   4  17  64  99   6  52  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that every agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given that there are 5 agents and 7 items, two agents will receive 2 items each, and three agents will receive 1 item each. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives items 0 and 2, maximizing the high valuations they have for these items.
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 1, which has the highest valuation of 99 for this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: Receives items 5 and 6, which both have high valuations of 85 and 89, respectively.
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 4, as it has a moderate value compared to others.
5. **Agent 4**: Receives item 3, with a valuation of 99, which is the highest for this item.

Now, let's allocate the items in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
