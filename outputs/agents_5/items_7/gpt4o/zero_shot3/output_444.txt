Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  17   4  22  49  12   0
1  27  14  86  14  62  79  10
2  55  67  60  25  70  58  89
3  75   9  97  24  63  85  22
4  17  34  54  23  17   5   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the values each agent assigns to each item and aim to maximize the total satisfaction or benefit for all agents. An approach to this problem is to consider each agent's highest valued items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that they value highly, while ensuring each item is allocated.

Let's analyze the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  19  17   4  22  49  12   0
1  27  14  86  14  62  79  10
2  55  67  60  25  70  58  89
3  75   9  97  24  63  85  22
4  17  34  54  23  17   5   7
```

We will allocate items based on maximizing the value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 4 with a value of 49.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 2 with a value of 86.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 6 with a value of 89.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 2 with a value of 97 (already taken by agent 1). The next highest is item 5 with a value of 85.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 2 with a value of 54 (already taken by agent 1). The next highest is item 1 with a value of 34.

We need to reevaluate based on availability after initial consideration:

- Agent 0: Take item 4.
- Agent 1: Take item 2.
- Agent 2: Take item 6.
- Agent 3: Take item 5.
- Agent 4: Take item 1.

Remaining items: 0, 3

- Agent 0: Next highest item is 3 (22).
- Agent 2: Next highest item is 0 (55).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 6, 0
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 1

Now, provide the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
