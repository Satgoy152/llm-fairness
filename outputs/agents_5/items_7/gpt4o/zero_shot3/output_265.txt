Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  24  99  72   3  77  66
1  23  67  28  70  53  84   6
2  87  39  88  97  39  45  10
3  44  62  24  44  41  59  97
4   6   9   1  66  59  47   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an appropriate number of items given their valuations. We should balance the allocations so that agents with higher valuations for certain items receive those items if possible, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's the allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 2 very highly (99), so we start by allocating item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a high valuation for item 5 (84), so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a high valuation for item 3 (97), so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has a high valuation for item 6 (97), so we allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent has a high valuation for item 4 (59), so we allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Now, we have 2 items left to allocate: item 0 and item 1.

6. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 to agent 2, as they have a relatively high valuation for it (87).
7. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 to agent 1, as they have a reasonably high valuation for it (67).

This allocation ensures that each agent has received at least one item, and the items are distributed in a way that respects the agents' valuations as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
