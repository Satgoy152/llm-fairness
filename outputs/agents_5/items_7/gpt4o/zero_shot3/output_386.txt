Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  85   5   4  32  23  65
1  15  62  62  87  54  46  17
2  94  78  22  39  12  51  15
3  26  23  40  39  26  33  75
4  14  68  98  94  49  13   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction. Given the constraint of allocating 7 items, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Valuations are [34, 85, 5, 4, 32, 23, 65]. The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 (85), followed by item 6 (65).
- Agent 1: Valuations are [15, 62, 62, 87, 54, 46, 17]. The highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 (87).
- Agent 2: Valuations are [94, 78, 22, 39, 12, 51, 15]. The highest value for Agent 2 is item 0 (94).
- Agent 3: Valuations are [26, 23, 40, 39, 26, 33, 75]. The highest value for Agent 3 is item 6 (75).
- Agent 4: Valuations are [14, 68, 98, 94, 49, 13, 5]. The highest value for Agent 4 is item 2 (98).

Based on these preferences, let's allocate the items:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Now we need to allocate the remaining two items (4 and 5). Let's assign them by considering the next highest valuations:

- Agent 1 values item 4 (54) and item 5 (46) highly after item 3.
- Agent 4 values item 3 (94) highly after item 2.

Let's assign item 4 to Agent 1 and item 5 to Agent 0, balancing the distribution of items among agents.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```
