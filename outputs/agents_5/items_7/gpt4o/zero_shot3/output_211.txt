Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  43  54   8  65  54  24
1  53  89  20  85  34  70  60
2  75  24  37  17  17  70  84
3  93  99  90  98  17  71  20
4  29  78  15  57  31   4  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy approach. We'll assign each item to the agent who values it the most and ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, with all items allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. For each item, find the agent that values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that exactly 7 items are allocated in total.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest value:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 93.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 99.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 90.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 98.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 65.
- Item 5: Agent 2 and Agent 1 both value it at 70. Let's give it to Agent 2 to balance allocations.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 84.

Now, let's ensure that each agent has at least an integer number of items and exactly 7 items are allocated.

The allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets items 5 and 6.
- Agent 3 gets items 0, 1, 2, and 3.
- Agent 4 gets no items.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 1, 2, 3],
    "4": []
}
```
