Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  10  79   8  62  98  55
1  48  35  51  71  26  10  52
2  56  93  49  85  96  85  10
3  69  27  27  98  85  10  52
4  79  44  54  72  27  26  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the values, the highest value for agent 0 is item 5 (value 98).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is item 3 (value 71).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is item 4 (value 96).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is item 3 (value 98), but it's already taken by agent 1. The next highest value is item 0 (value 69).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is item 0 (value 79), but it's already taken by agent 3. The next highest value is item 2 (value 54).

Now let's see which items are left and allocate them to balance the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Has item 5.
- **Agent 1**: Has item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Has item 4.
- **Agent 3**: Has item 0.
- **Agent 4**: Has item 2.

Items still available are 1 and 6.

- **Agent 0**: Add item 6 (value 55).
- **Agent 1**: Add item 1 (value 35).

This gives us:

- **Agent 0**: Items [5, 6].
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 1].
- **Agent 2**: Item [4].
- **Agent 3**: Item [0].
- **Agent 4**: Item [2].

All items are now allocated, and each agent gets at least one item. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
