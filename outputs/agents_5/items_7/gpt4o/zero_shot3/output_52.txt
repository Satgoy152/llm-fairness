Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  76  54  62  50  60  17
1  52  30  11   9  37  99  78
2  53  96  87  97  82  52  19
3  40  92  67  32  98  36  16
4  69  46  97   1  90  44  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's consider a strategy such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more than one item. We will aim for a fair distribution by considering each agent's highest-valued items available and ensuring each agent has an opportunity to receive high-valued items. 

Below is one possible fair allocation based on maximizing each agent's total value:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 1 (values 12 and 76, respectively)
- Agent 1: Assign item 5 (value 99)
- Agent 2: Assign item 3 (value 97)
- Agent 3: Assign item 4 (value 98)
- Agent 4: Assign items 2 and 6 (values 97 and 24, respectively)

Now let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that we fairly distribute the items based on the given valuations.
