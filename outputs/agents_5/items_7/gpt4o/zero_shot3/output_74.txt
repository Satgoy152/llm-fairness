Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  46  93  47  70  32  14
1  61  28  80  76  48  13  81
2  98  89  58  90  86  59  72
3  31   9  59  27  18  55  31
4  64  25  66  17  52  30  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations and try to maximize the satisfaction or utility for each agent. One common approach is to use a method that aims to provide each agent with items they value highly, in a way that balances the overall distribution of value.

In this case, let's examine the valuations and try to make allocations that are as fair as possible:

1. Agent 0's highest values are for items 2 (93) and 0 (77).
2. Agent 1's highest values are for items 2 (80) and 6 (81).
3. Agent 2's highest values are for items 0 (98), 3 (90), and 1 (89).
4. Agent 3's highest values are for items 2 (59) and 5 (55).
5. Agent 4's highest values are for items 2 (66) and 0 (64).

Given these valuations, we can try to allocate items to maximize the satisfaction:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it is the next highest valued item for Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it is also highly valued by them.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as it is one of their highest valued items.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as it is a relatively high valued item for them.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 1, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

These allocations consider the highest values for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.
