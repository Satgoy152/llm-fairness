Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  14  58  55  21  84  74
1  82  77  19  54  74  79  63
2  92  93   7  29  84  51  99
3  36  46  77  61  90  97  13
4  55  62  39  87  13  53  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents given their valuations, we'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring a balanced distribution overall. Since there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

A good approach is to consider the highest-valued items for each agent and allocate such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent, ensuring fairness.
3. Ensure all items are allocated and that no agent receives more than their fair share if possible.

Let's analyze the table and allocate:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (value of 84).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value of 82).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (value of 99).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most but it's already taken, so next is item 4 (value of 90).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most (value of 87).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- After item 5 is assigned to agent 0, we can consider their next highest, which is item 2.
- Agent 1 can also take their next highest, which is item 4.
- Agent 2 has already got item 6; they can take their next highest, which is item 0.
- Agent 3 should take their next highest (after item 4), which is item 5 or 1.
- Agent 4 has been allocated item 3, leaving item 1 or 2.

After considering this, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a share of the items, and the total number of items is 7.
