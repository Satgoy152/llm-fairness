Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  27  17  83  28  34  62
1   7  10  96  40  94  92  19
2  69  38   8  53  57  46  97
3  34  47  72  14  79  61  89
4  98  88  26  65  49  21  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them the items they value the most. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Rank each agent's preference for items**: For each agent, list the items in decreasing order of their valuations.

2. **Iterative Allocation**: Begin by allocating the most valued item for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once. Continue this process until all items are assigned.

3. **Check Fairness**: Ensure that each agent receives an approximately equal number of items, given there are 7 items and 5 agents.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are 83 (item 3), 62 (item 6), and 42 (item 0)
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are 96 (item 2), 94 (item 4), and 92 (item 5)
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are 97 (item 6), 69 (item 0), and 57 (item 4)
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are 89 (item 6), 79 (item 4), and 72 (item 2)
- **Agent 4**: Highest values are 98 (item 0), 88 (item 1), and 65 (item 3)

Following these preferences while ensuring no item is double-allocated, the following assignments can be made:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 4
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly, with each agent receiving items closest to their highest valuations, and no items are left unallocated.
