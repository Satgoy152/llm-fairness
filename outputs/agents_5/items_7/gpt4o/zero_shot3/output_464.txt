Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  49   9  75   7  47  42
1  59   2  29  33  58   5  65
2  28  43  18  87  13  92  36
3  76  27  77  71  72  11  25
4  10   9  45  63  11  56  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that each agent receives an integer number of items while maximizing their total valuation for the items they receive. One approach is to assign items such that the overall satisfaction or total valuation across all agents is maximized.

Let's go through the table and allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each item:

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 86
   - Agent 3 values it at 76
   - Allocate to Agent 0

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0 values it at 49
   - Agent 2 values it at 43
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 3 values it at 77
   - Allocate to Agent 3

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 2 values it at 87
   - Allocate to Agent 2

5. **Item 4**:  
   - Agent 3 values it at 72
   - Allocate to Agent 3

6. **Item 5**:  
   - Agent 2 values it at 92
   - Allocate to Agent 2

7. **Item 6**:  
   - Agent 1 values it at 65
   - Allocate to Agent 1

This allocation considers the top valuations for each item, ensuring agents receive items that they value highly. Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": []
}
```

These allocations ensure that each item is assigned, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7, as required.
