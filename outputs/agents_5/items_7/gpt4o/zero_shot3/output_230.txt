Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  46  82  74  18  10  57
1  83   8  82   7  34  69  22
2  98  33   5  67   7  75  89
3   4  81  15  74  26  43  42
4  98  18  47  82  38  14  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no agent receives more than a fair share.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Begin by identifying which agent has the highest valuation for each item.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. If an agent already has two items, consider reallocating to the next highest bidder if necessary.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If any agent ends up with no items in the initial allocation, adjust by reallocating items to ensure that each agent receives at least one item.

4. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Double-check that all items are allocated and that the total number of allocated items is exactly 7.

Following this method, here is the allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives item 2: Valuation of 82.
- **Agent 1** receives item 0: Valuation of 83.
- **Agent 2** receives item 6: Valuation of 89.
- **Agent 3** receives item 1: Valuation of 81.
- **Agent 4** receives items 3, 4, and 5: Valuations of 82, 38, and 14 respectively.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
