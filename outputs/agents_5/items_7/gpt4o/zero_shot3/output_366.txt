Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  28  90  77  68  30  67
1  48  80  42  81  77  86  42
2  78  15  97   1  33  25  54
3  43  75  97  25  36  40  44
4  76  63  83  52   0  64   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we can use a simple heuristic approach to ensure that each agent gets an equal number of items or as close to equal as possible, given there are 7 items and 5 agents. This means some agents will receive 1 item while others will receive 2 items. We will allocate based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction, which is determined by their valuation of the items.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent places on any item.
2. Assign the item with the highest value to each agent if possible.
3. Continue assigning items to agents based on the next highest value available, ensuring that no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Following this approach, here's one way to allocate:

- Agent 0: Highest value is 90 (Item 2)
- Agent 1: Highest value is 86 (Item 5)
- Agent 2: Highest value is 97 (Item 2, already taken, so next is 97 for Item 3)
- Agent 3: Highest value is 97 (Item 2, already taken, so next is 75 for Item 1)
- Agent 4: Highest value is 83 (Item 2, already taken, so next is 76 for Item 0)

After this initial allocation based on highest values, we need to ensure all items are allocated:

1. Items Allocated: 2, 5, 3, 1, 0
2. Items Remaining: 4, 6

Let's distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest available values:

- Agent 1 can take Item 4 (77)
- Agent 0 can take Item 6 (67)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives either 1 or 2 items, and all items are distributed among the agents.
