Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  87  71  88  56   8  62
1  48  54  22  70  71  66   8
2  29   0   9  49  13  82  94
3  24  60  42  93  44  47  49
4  91  95  42  20  99  44  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a round-robin or a greedy method, ensuring that we consider the highest value for each agent in a balanced way.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 3 (88) and 1 (87).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 4 (71) and 3 (70).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 6 (94) and 5 (82).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 3 (93) and 1 (60).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 4 (99) and 1 (95).

Let's try to allocate items based on these highest values while ensuring each agent gets some items.

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 3, as it's their highest value not yet assigned.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 4, as it's their highest value not yet assigned.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 6, as it's their highest value not yet assigned.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 1, as it's their highest value not yet assigned.
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 0, as it's their highest value not yet assigned.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items 2 and 5:

- Agent 4 can take item 5, as it's another high value for them (44).
- Agent 2 can take item 2, as it balances their allocation, and they have some value for it (9).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the high value items with ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
