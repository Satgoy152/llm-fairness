Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84   0  30   0  97  67  96
1  76  46  74  48  46  94  55
2   8  37  55  87  42  10  41
3  62  69  21  57  26  64  61
4  17  58  80  42  27  58  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations provided for each item by each agent and try to distribute the items in such a way that the total value received by each agent is as balanced as possible. We will aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0, 4, and 6. Let's assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 0, 2, and 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values items 1, 3, and 5. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
6. We have assigned 5 items, and items 4 and 6 are left unassigned.
7. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 to balance their high valuation.
8. Assign item 6 to Agent 4 to balance their high valuation.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent and attempts to balance the total value received by each agent as much as possible.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```
