Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  46  24  55  84  67  87
1  95  13  20  14  42  52  12
2  99  51  99  69  48  31  69
3  69  20  87  40  72  50   2
4  17  99  61  67  97  14  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Since there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value item: 6 (value 87)
   - Next highest: 4 (value 84)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item: 0 (value 95)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value item: 2 (value 99)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value item: 3 (value 40)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest value item: 1 (value 99)
   - Next highest: 5 (value 14)

This allocation strategy ensures that each agent receives at least one item (except for Agent 3 due to the limited number of items) and maximizes the individual values each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
