Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  42  85  50  79  97  94
1  13  21  73  89  35  45   1
2  20  75  20  73  31  11  56
3  44  23  83  77  38  58  46
4  82  49  67  62  89  17  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and distribute the items in a way that attempts to maximize the total value for all agents. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives the items they value the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most at 97. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 89. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 75. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most at 83. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most at 89. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Items 0 and 6 are still unallocated. We can assign the remaining items to agents who have not received their second-highest valued items yet:

- Agent 0 also values item 6 highly at 94. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Agent 4 values item 0 at 82, which is their second-highest value after item 4. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable number of items based on their valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
