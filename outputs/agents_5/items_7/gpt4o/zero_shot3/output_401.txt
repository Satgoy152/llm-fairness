Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  43  92   3  12  53  99
1  46   2  78  62  50  26   6
2  60  31  41  73  48  82  78
3  75  99  89   3  13  82  28
4  15  17  25  10  53  82  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. One way to approach this is to consider the highest valuations first and attempt to distribute items in a manner that ensures fairness across agents.

Let's analyze the valuations for each agent and allocate the items accordingly:

Agent 0: 
- Highest valuations are for items 6 (99), 2 (92), and 5 (53).

Agent 1:
- Highest valuations are for items 2 (78), 3 (62), and 0 (46).

Agent 2:
- Highest valuations are for items 5 (82), 3 (73), and 6 (78).

Agent 3:
- Highest valuations are for items 1 (99), 2 (89), and 5 (82).

Agent 4:
- Highest valuations are for items 5 (82), 4 (53), and 6 (54).

Now, let's distribute the items:

1. Allocate item 6 to agent 0 (highest valuation: 99).
2. Allocate item 5 to agent 2 (highest valuation: 82).
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 3 (highest valuation: 89).
4. Allocate item 1 to agent 3 (next highest for agent 3: 99).
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 4 (highest valuation: 53).
6. Allocate item 0 to agent 1 (highest remaining valuation: 46).
7. Allocate item 3 to agent 2 (next highest for agent 2: 73).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Final Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
