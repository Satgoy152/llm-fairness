Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  72   9   4  91  11  77
1   7  77  17  41  43  68  52
2   3  71  37   7  45  53  74
3  47  44   1  26   7  88  28
4  44  93  98  74  80  59  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items amongst the agents, we can consider various strategies. However, given that there are 7 items and 5 agents, not every agent can receive an item. A simple allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This maximizes the total satisfaction across all agents.

Let's analyze each item and see which agent values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 59, which is the highest.
2. Item 1: Agent 4 values it at 93, which is the highest.
3. Item 2: Agent 4 values it at 98, which is the highest.
4. Item 3: Agent 4 values it at 74, which is the highest.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 91, which is the highest.
6. Item 5: Agent 3 values it at 88, which is the highest.
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 77, which is the highest.

Now, let's assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 4, 6
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets no items.
- Agent 3 gets item: 5
- Agent 4 gets items: 1, 2, 3

Finally, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
