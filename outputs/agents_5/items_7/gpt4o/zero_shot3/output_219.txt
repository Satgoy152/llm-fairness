Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  33  46  88   5  56  58
1  30   2  45  50  64  17  33
2  62  72  41  82  99  26  47
3  17  49  12  50   2  37  91
4  66  76  16   4   2  65  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible. One approach is to allocate items to the agent that values them the most until all items are assigned. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0** is valued highest by Agent 4 (value: 66).
2. **Item 1** is valued highest by Agent 4 (value: 76).
3. **Item 2** is valued highest by Agent 0 (value: 46).
4. **Item 3** is valued highest by Agent 0 (value: 88).
5. **Item 4** is valued highest by Agent 2 (value: 99).
6. **Item 5** is valued highest by Agent 0 (value: 56).
7. **Item 6** is valued highest by Agent 3 (value: 91).

After allocating the items based on the highest valuation, the distribution is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3, 5
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 0, 1

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and the allocations are balanced based on the given valuations.
