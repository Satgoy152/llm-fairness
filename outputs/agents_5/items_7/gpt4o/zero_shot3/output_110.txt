Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  97  35  65  32  39  31
1  39  95  15  74  29  42  48
2  59  59  16  23  18  65  97
3  80  48   6  16  16  11  10
4  17  76  36  93  93  46  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high values for items 0 and 1.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 3 highly.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 highly.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent doesn't have high values for any specific items compared to others, so they might receive items with lower overall values.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values items 4 and 5 highly.

With these considerations, the allocation could be as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 6.
- Agent 3 receives item 2.
- Agent 4 receives items 4 and 5.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 7. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
