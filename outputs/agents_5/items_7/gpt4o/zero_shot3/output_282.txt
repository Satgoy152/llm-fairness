Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  45  67  50  44   4  71
1  54  37  17  83  85  49  77
2  88  32  85   6  53  95   1
3  43  52  56  67  68  79  81
4  72  89  81  11  53  25  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. Identify which agent values each item the most.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, or adjust allocations as necessary to ensure fairness and complete distribution of all items.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (88).
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most (89).
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (85).
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (83).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (85).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (95).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (71).

Initial Allocation:
- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [1]

Adjustments:
- To ensure every agent gets at least one item, we can reallocate one item from an agent with multiple items to Agent 3.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0, 5]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1, 2]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```
