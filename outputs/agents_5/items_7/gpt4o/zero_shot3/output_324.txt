Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  17  71  62  76  94  96
1  42  66  47  69  93  21  60
2  18  18  34  51  30   0  23
3  19  39  14  70   3  80  76
4  70   3  64  30  11  16  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One approach is to allocate items in a way that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most. If an item is valued equally by multiple agents, we can break ties arbitrarily.
2. Allocate the items accordingly, ensuring that all items are allocated and no agent receives more items than there are available.

Let's go through the allocations:

- Item 0: Allocated to Agent 0 (value: 71, highest among all agents)
- Item 1: Allocated to Agent 1 (value: 66, highest among all agents)
- Item 2: Allocated to Agent 0 (value: 71, highest among all agents)
- Item 3: Allocated to Agent 3 (value: 70, highest among all agents)
- Item 4: Allocated to Agent 1 (value: 93, highest among all agents)
- Item 5: Allocated to Agent 0 (value: 94, highest among all agents)
- Item 6: Allocated to Agent 0 (value: 96, highest among all agents)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and respects the highest valuation preference, while every agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation, Agent 0 receives four items (0, 2, 5, 6), Agent 1 receives two items (1, 4), Agent 3 receives one item (3), and Agents 2 and 4 do not receive any items due to their lower valuations compared to other agents.
