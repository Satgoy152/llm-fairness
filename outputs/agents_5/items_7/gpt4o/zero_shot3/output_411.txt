Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  89  70  55  26   7  50
1  29  61  87  99  36  33  98
2  91  51  28  93  78   3  44
3  42   4  29  78  88  88  40
4  46  96   5  11  21  86  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider the valuations so that each agent receives items they value relatively highly. One approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the items:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is by agent 0 (92).
- **Item 1**: Highest value is by agent 4 (96).
- **Item 2**: Highest value is by agent 1 (87).
- **Item 3**: Highest value is by agent 1 (99).
- **Item 4**: Highest value is by agent 3 (88).
- **Item 5**: Highest value is by agent 4 (86).
- **Item 6**: Highest value is by agent 1 (98).

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Allocate item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Allocate items 2, 3, and 6. 
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Allocate no items for now, since other agents have higher values.
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Allocate item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Allocate items 1 and 5.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it highly, and every agent receives at least one item or no items. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
