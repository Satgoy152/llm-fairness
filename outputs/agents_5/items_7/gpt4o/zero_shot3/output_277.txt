Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92   4  65  21  42   7  38
1  52  27  12  92  94  53  82
2  19  73  91  33  11  19  34
3  60   7  27  25  50  40  44
4  21   3  47  62  87  79  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [21  3 47 62 87 79 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. A simple greedy strategy can be employed where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as each agent receives at least one item. Here's how the allocation might look:

1. Item 0 has the highest valuation from Agent 0 (92).
2. Item 1 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (73).
3. Item 2 has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (91).
4. Item 3 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (92).
5. Item 4 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (94).
6. Item 5 has the highest valuation from Agent 4 (79).
7. Item 6 has the highest valuation from Agent 1 (82).

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item. We need to make adjustments because Agent 3 doesn't have any items:

- Remove one item from Agent 1 and give it to Agent 3. Let's choose Item 6 because it has the lowest valuation difference for Agent 1 (82) and Agent 3 (44).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 5

Now, let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5]
}
```
