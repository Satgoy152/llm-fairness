Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  81  67  91  12  95  96
1  67  32  28  48  18  84  21
2   0  53   7  53  91  23  47
3  83  31   1  78  28  43  14
4  67  87   7  57   1  12  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that looks at maximizing the total value for each agent based on their preferences. We'll try to distribute the items such that the value each agent receives is as balanced as possible, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Calculate each agent's maximum value for an item**: We look for which item each agent values the most.
2. **Allocate items based on highest satisfaction**: We will assign items to agents starting with the highest possible satisfaction, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

Here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 5, 6 (Values: 95, 96)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (Value: 67)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (Value: 91)
- **Agent 3**: Items 3 (Value: 78)
- **Agent 4**: Items 1, 2 (Values: 87, 7)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the valuation each agent receives for the items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the requested json format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```
