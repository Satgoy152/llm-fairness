Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  97  82  87   8  95  66
1  58  23   1  67  42  79  84
2  21  69  52  34  12   2  15
3  60  21   7   1  66  21  21
4  42  67  95  47  55  48   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent has an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 1, 2, 3, and 5. Allocate items 1 and 3, which have very high valuations.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 6. Allocate item 6 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Doesn't have very high valuations but is relatively high for item 1. However, item 1 is already given to Agent 0, so item 2, which is unallocated, is given to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a relatively high valuation for item 0. Allocate item 0 to them.
5. **Agent 4**: Has a high valuation for item 2, but it's allocated to Agent 2, so item 5 and item 4 are given to Agent 4.

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 3]
- **Agent 1**: Item [6]
- **Agent 2**: Item [2]
- **Agent 3**: Item [0]
- **Agent 4**: Items [4, 5]

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
