Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  53  75   2  42   6  58
1  99  94  86  47  18   0  85
2  37  60  75  63  29  50  10
3  25  63  57  36   1  53  77
4  27  51  14  79  25  67  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. This can be approached by evaluating each agent's preferences for the items and then distributing the items to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 0 (85), 2 (75)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 because it is the highest value for this agent.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 0 (99), 1 (94), 2 (86)
   - Since item 0 is already allocated, choose item 1 (94) for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (75), 1 (60), 3 (63)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 as it is the highest unallocated item.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 6 (77), 1 (63)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 as it is the highest unallocated item.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value items: 3 (79), 5 (67)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4 as it is the highest unallocated item.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6. We still need to allocate items 4 and 5.

6. **Remaining items (4, 5)**:
   - Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 4 (25), so allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
   - Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 4 (67), so allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [3, 4, 5]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
