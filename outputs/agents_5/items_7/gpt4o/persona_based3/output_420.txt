Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  60  40  67   0  16  76
1  84   2  92  43  53  12  77
2  86  68  63  39  73  51  40
3  87  92  12  27  29  53  79
4  95  63   1  35  66  65  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents in such a way that the allocation is fair. A common approach to achieve fairness is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations of each agent for each item, we can use a fair division algorithm to distribute the items. One such algorithm is the envy-free round-robin allocation method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool of items.

Let's proceed with the round-robin allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 the most (value 76), so they pick item 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (value 92), so they pick item 2.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (value 86), so they pick item 0.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most (value 92), so they pick item 1.
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the most, but itâ€™s already taken. So, they pick the next highest valued item, which is item 5 (value 65).
6. **Agent 0** gets another turn. They value item 3 the most (value 67), so they pick item 3.
7. **Agent 1** gets another turn. Their next highest valued remaining item is item 4 (value 53), so they pick item 4.

Now, let's verify that each item is allocated to exactly one agent and that the allocation is fair. Each agent has picked according to their preferences when possible, aiming to minimize envy.

The allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
