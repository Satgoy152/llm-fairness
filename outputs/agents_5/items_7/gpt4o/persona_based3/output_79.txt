Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14   2  50  76  74  25  18
1  22  41  83  53  76  49  87
2  30  29  12  66  86  34  50
3  39  48  82  49  39  80  55
4  49  27  84  25   4  90  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to allocate the items in a way that minimizes envy among the agents. We have 5 agents and 7 items, and each agent can receive an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agent
0     14   2  50  76  74  25  18
1     22  41  83  53  76  49  87
2     30  29  12  66  86  34  50
3     39  48  82  49  39  80  55
4     49  27  84  25   4  90  38
```

To ensure fairness, we can use a combination of approaches, such as checking for envy-freeness and maximizing the total value (utilitarian approach).

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent and try to assign them if no other agent values it significantly higher.
2. Aim to distribute the remaining items in such a way that each agent receives some value, thereby minimizing envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (76), which is also highly valued by others, but we will assign it to Agent 0 as their highest preference.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 6 (87), so we'll assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 (86) the most, so we assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 (80) the most, so we assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 (84) the most, so we assign item 2 to Agent 4.
- Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 1.
  - Item 0 can be assigned to Agent 4, who values it second highest after item 2.
  - Item 1 can be assigned to Agent 1 as they value it second highest after item 6.

After this allocation, the distribution of items is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution tries to minimize envy by aligning high-value items with respective agents while ensuring all items are allocated.
