Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  19  85  63   1  82  60
1   3  24  73  59  27  28  71
2  70  17  87  83  77  42  20
3  16  98  86  15  91  62  21
4  42  27  83  99  56  70  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an approach that maximizes each agent's valuation of the items they receive. We need to ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items.
2. Allocate items to agents in such a way that the sum of valuations for each agent is maximized.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 very highly (85), so we give item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly (71), so we give item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly (83), so we give item 3 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (98), so we give item 1 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly (56), so we give item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have two items left (0 and 5) that need to be allocated:

- Agent 0 could also benefit from item 0 (16) or item 5 (82); however, item 5 has a higher value for Agent 0, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- Finally, we allocate item 0 to Agent 3, who values it equally with Agent 0.

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 5]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1, 0]
- Agent 4: [4]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
