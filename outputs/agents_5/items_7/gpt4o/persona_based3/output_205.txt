Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  54  95  33  29  71  77
1  36  77  61  15  68  67  79
2  44  44  33  96  73  23  85
3  77  98  50  29  83  57  61
4   9  40  29  65  32  84  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 44 33 96 73 23 85]

 [ 9 40 29 65 32 84 30]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 and 6. Assigning item 2 to Agent 0 would satisfy one of their highest preferences.
- **Agent 1** values item 6 highly, so it would be beneficial to allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 3. Assigning item 3 to Agent 2 would align with their preferences.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 the most. Therefore, assigning item 1 to Agent 3 makes sense.
- **Agent 4** seems to value item 5 highly. Assigning item 5 to Agent 4 would be appropriate.

At this point, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items while considering the remaining preferences.

- **Remaining items**: 0 and 4.
- **Agent 0** can receive item 0 since they have a reasonable preference for it.
- **Agent 4** can receive item 4, which does not conflict significantly with the preferences of other agents.

This allocation attempts to balance preferences while ensuring each agent receives items they value.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
