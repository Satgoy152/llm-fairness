Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  23  15   2  79  83  77
1  75  17  61  27  72  56  99
2  17  25  86  13  34  48  86
3  11   6  83  76   5  34  45
4  49  34  83  29  31   1  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, I'll use the concept of maximizing the minimum allocation value for each agent while ensuring that no agent feels envious of another. This involves ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. I'll try to balance the allocations based on individual valuations to maintain fairness.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 4, 5, and 6.  
   Allocate item 0 (value 86) and item 5 (value 83) to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**  
   Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 6.  
   Allocate item 6 (value 99) to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**  
   Agent 2 values items 2 and 6 highly, but since item 6 is already allocated, item 2 is the next best.  
   Allocate item 2 (value 86) to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**  
   Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3.  
   Allocate item 3 (value 76) to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**  
   Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 6, but since item 6 is already allocated, item 4 is the next best.  
   Allocate item 4 (value 31) to agent 4.

6. **Distribute remaining items:**  
   At this point, items 1 and 4 are remaining. To ensure all items are allocated and each agent feels they have received a fair share, we consider remaining items and distribute them based on remaining needs:
   - Allocate item 1 (value 23) to agent 4 since it has the next highest valuation for agent 4 after item 4.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives some value while distributing all items.
