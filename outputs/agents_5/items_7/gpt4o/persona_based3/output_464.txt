Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  77  20  98  57  21  85
1  79  17   7  35  10  54  97
2  41  76  71  49  83  32  24
3  98  90  75  20   5  25  68
4   7  61  23   2  89  75  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own.

Here is one way to achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Each agent will initially get one item that they value highly. This will help in minimizing envy.

2. **Allocate Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Start by sorting each agent's valuation of items and allocate the item that has the highest valuation but hasn't been allocated yet.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:**
   - Since there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

4. **Maximize Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Assign remaining items to agents who value them most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 3 the most (98). Assign item 3.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 6 the most (97). Assign item 6.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 4 the most (83). Assign item 4.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 0 the most (98). Assign item 0.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 5 the most (75). Assign item 5.

Now, the remaining unallocated items are 1 and 2.

- **Item 1:** It is valued highly by Agent 3 (90), but since we want to distribute the items fairly across agents, we assign it to Agent 2, who values it at 76, the next highest unallocated value.
- **Item 2:** It is valued highest by Agent 3 (75). Since Agent 3 only has one item so far (item 0), we assign item 2 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This distribution aims to minimize envy and ensure that each agent is content with their allocation based on their valuations.
