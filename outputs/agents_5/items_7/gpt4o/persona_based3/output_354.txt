Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  65  33  72   4  48  90
1  39  14  94  31  76  76  29
2   9  60  12  51  74   4  49
3  87  73  25   5  44  97  12
4  79  46  95  82  48  90  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39 14 94 31 76 76 29]
 [ 9 60 12 51 74  4 49]
 [87 73 25  5 44 97 12]
 [79 46 95 82 48 90 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to achieve an allocation where each agent feels they are receiving a fair share of the goods. One common criterion to consider is "envy-freeness," which seeks to ensure that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuations table, we can try to distribute items in a way that maximizes each agent's valuation while minimizing potential envy. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 highly (90), so we assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 highly (94), so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 highly (74), so we assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 highly (97), so we assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 highly (82), so we assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 1:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (87) for item 0. Since Agent 3 only has item 5, we can assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- **Item 1**: Agent 3 also has a high valuation (73) for item 1. To balance the allocations, we can assign item 1 to Agent 4, who currently has 1 item.

This allocation aims to minimize envy and maximize satisfaction based on individual valuations. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 0],
    "4": [3, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated.
