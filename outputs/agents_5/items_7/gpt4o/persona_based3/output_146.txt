Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  14  72  43  12  34  37  75
1  44  59  54  47  75  31  38
2  36  51  88  98  21  73  58
3   6  55  44  67  98  17  61
4  65   8  52   0  98  80  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free or as close to envy-free allocation as possible, where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given the valuations provided, let's proceed with a potential allocation strategy:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 6 the most (75). Assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 4 the most (75). Assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most (98). Assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 3, which is also taken. The next is item 6 (61), also taken. So assign item 1 (55) to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 4 the most, but it's already taken. The next is item 5 (80). Assign item 5 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. Let's allocate the remaining 2 items:

6. **Agent 0**: After item 6, agent 0 values item 1 the most (72), already taken. Next, item 2 (43). Assign item 2 to agent 0.
7. **Agent 1**: After item 4, agent 1 values item 0 the most (44). Assign item 0 to agent 1.

Finally, the allocation is completed with all 7 items distributed.

### Allocation Summary

Each agent is assigned the items they value the most that were still available, aiming to balance the total value they perceive in their bundle. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has received items according to their valuations, and while not perfectly envy-free, it considers their highest preferences given the constraints.
