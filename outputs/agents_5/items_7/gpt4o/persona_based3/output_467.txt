Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28   6  74   5  28  91  18
1  96  41  53  76  37  38  42
2  59  19  90  87  97  15  64
3  62  93  25  62  68  70  28
4   9  80  73  61   1  23  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute them in such a way that minimizes envy and ensures a fair division based on the agents' valuations. One common method to achieve this is by using the "envy-free" criterion, where each agent receives a bundle of items they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle.

Let's consider the valuations provided and try to allocate the items:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 28     | 6      | 74     | 5      | 28     | 91     | 18     |
| 1     | 96     | 41     | 53     | 76     | 37     | 38     | 42     |
| 2     | 59     | 19     | 90     | 87     | 97     | 15     | 64     |
| 3     | 62     | 93     | 25     | 62     | 68     | 70     | 28     |
| 4     | 9      | 80     | 73     | 61     | 1      | 23     | 65     |

A potential allocation could be:

1. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations for a single item, then move to the next highest unallocated item and continue.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, given the constraints.

Here's the allocation plan:

- Agent 0: Highest value for item 5 (91). Assign item 5.
- Agent 1: Highest value for item 0 (96). Assign item 0.
- Agent 2: Highest value for item 4 (97). Assign item 4.
- Agent 3: Highest value for item 1 (93). Assign item 1.
- Agent 4: Highest value for item 2 (73). Assign item 2.

Now, we have two items left to allocate (items 3 and 6):

- Item 3: Assign to Agent 2 as it's their second highest value (87).
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 4 as it's their next highest valued unallocated item (65).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and attempts to maximize their individual satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```
