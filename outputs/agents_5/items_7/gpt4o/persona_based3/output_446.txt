Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  83  75  46   4  95  25
1  47   7  41  41  40  73  41
2  39  42  40  44   5  15  21
3  68  45  91  36  11  18  89
4  42  14  36  82  46  86  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocated bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle. This is a challenging optimization problem, but we can use a reasonable heuristic approach to achieve a balanced allocation. Here's one potential method:

1. **Calculate Total Values**: First, sum the total value each agent places on all items to understand their overall valuation perspective.
2. **Assign Highest Valued Items**: Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their satisfaction based on individual item valuations.
3. **Balance the Allocation**: Ensure each agent receives at least one item, and adjust allocations if necessary to balance perceived fairness.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are on items 5 (95), 1 (83), and 2 (75).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is on item 5 (73).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is on item 1 (42).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are on items 2 (91), 6 (89).
- **Agent 4**: Highest values are on items 6 (93), 5 (86).

Given these preferences, we can allocate items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items [0, 1]. These are high-value items for them.
- **Agent 1**: Gets item [5]. This is their highest-valued item.
- **Agent 2**: Gets item [2]. This item is of relatively higher value for them compared to others.
- **Agent 3**: Gets item [6]. This item is highly valued by them.
- **Agent 4**: Gets item [3, 4]. These are not the highest individually, but together they provide a good bundle relative to other allocations.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items aligned with their highest valuations.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize fairness by considering each agent's preferences and ensuring everyone receives at least one item.
