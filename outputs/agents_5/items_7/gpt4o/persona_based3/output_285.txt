Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  57  58  24   6  76  86
1  68  39  29  59  68  62  81
2  82  68  98  81  80  52  37
3  99  29  66  57  64  25  69
4  51  61  78  20  50  15  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own.

Let's consider the valuations for each item by each agent and try to allocate the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most (value of 86). Allocate item 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value of 68). Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value of 98). Allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the most, but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 3 (value of 57). Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the most, but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 1 (value of 61). Allocate item 1 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.

6. **Remaining Items (4 and 5)**:
   - Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 5 (value of 76). Allocate item 5 to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 4 (value of 68). Allocate item 4 to agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

We have now allocated all 7 items. The allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and we attempted to allocate items according to each agent's highest preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and tries to respect their preferences as much as possible.
