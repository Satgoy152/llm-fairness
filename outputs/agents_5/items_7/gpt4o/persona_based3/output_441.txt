Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  22  63  48  97  48  59
1  67  24  66  42  59  59  54
2  12  99  57  28  52  68  28
3  83  84  67  39  90  50  57
4  84  39  58  13  53  86  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the problem of fair division and ensure envy-freeness among the agents, we can use the Maximum Weighted Matching approach. In this approach, we aim to allocate items to agents such that the total valuation sum is maximized, and each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 4 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 2 (66).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 1 (99).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 0 (83).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 5 (86).

Now, we have two items left, items 3 and 6. We will allocate these remaining items based on the next highest valuations while ensuring no agent feels envious.

- **Agent 0** has a second-highest valuation for item 6 (59).
- **Agent 3** has a second-highest valuation for item 3 (39).

Now, we have allocated all 7 items. Here's how the allocations look:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to exactly one agent and each agent has at least one item, except for Agent 4, who only gets one item but it is the item they value the most. The allocation tries to maximize the total valuation while attempting to maintain fairness and reduce envy.
