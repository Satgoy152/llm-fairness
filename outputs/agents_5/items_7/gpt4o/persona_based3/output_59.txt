Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  99  73  74  94   8   8
1  99  74  53  71  67  29  15
2   7  52  88  71  60  78  35
3  78  17  64  40  65  96  91
4  92  43  49  49  48  49  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to achieve envy-freeness or at least minimize envy among the agents. Here's a possible allocation strategy that attempts to balance the total valuation of items each agent receives:

- Agent 0 values items 0 and 1 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest but can also be satisfied with item 2.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest.
- Agent 3 values items 5 and 6 highly.
- Agent 4 has a more balanced valuation but values item 0 highly.

A potential fair allocation can be:

- Assign items based on each agent's highest value item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and then balance the remaining items to minimize envy.

Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 4: Item [4]

This allocation gives each agent a set of items according to their preferences while attempting to distribute total values fairly.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
