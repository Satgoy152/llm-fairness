Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  21  87  54  71  91   4
1  39  10  57  84  77   4  86
2  30  69   6  75  70  31  98
3  54  23  38  84   9  30  95
4  21  69  92  55  15  71  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Here, each agent should ideally receive items such that they value their allocation at least as much as any other agent values their allocation.

Here is a possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 5 the highest (91).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the highest (84).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the highest (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 6, also taken. Then item 0 (54).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the highest (92).

Now, allocate remaining items:

- **Item 4**: Highest remaining value is by Agent 2 (70), but Agent 2 already has item 6. Next is Agent 1 (77), but already has item 3. Next is Agent 0 (71).
- **Item 1**: Highest remaining value is by Agent 2 (69), but Agent 2 already has item 6. Next is Agent 4 (69).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [5, 4]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [2, 1]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed.
