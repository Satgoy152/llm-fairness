Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  52  81  41  90  11  12
1  22  52  94  63  84  80  80
2   5  48  36  63  53  81  53
3  66  93  18  87  28  92  43
4  71  58  64  84  32  68  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to focus on ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations. One common approach to achieve fairness is to aim for an "envy-free" allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, since we are working with integer allocations and maximizing valuations while ensuring fairness, we might prioritize achieving a balanced distribution of perceived value among the agents.

Here's one possible allocation that attempts to fairly distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (90), Item 2 (81)
   - Allocations to Agent 0: Items 4, 2

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (94), Item 4 (84)
   - Allocations to Agent 1: Items 3, 5 (next highest valuations: 63, 80)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (81), Item 4 (53)
   - Allocations to Agent 2: Items 6

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (93), Item 5 (92)
   - Allocations to Agent 3: Items 1

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (94), Item 3 (84)
   - Allocations to Agent 4: Items 0

Now let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item they value highly, while the total number of items allocated adds up to 7, as required, and each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.
