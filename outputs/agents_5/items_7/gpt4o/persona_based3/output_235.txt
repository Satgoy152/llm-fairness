Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   6  51  65  96  83   0   0
1  35   4  31  36   9  64  60
2  16  18  90  26  80  85   4
3   7   8  50  88  76  16  89
4  47  97  37  33  65  32   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we will try to allocate items in a manner that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives at least some value from the items they are allocated. A common method to achieve this is the "Envy-free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, which means each agent should not envy another agent after the removal of at most one item from the other agent's bundle.

Let's analyze the given valuations and make an allocation:

1. Identify items with high valuations unique to certain agents, as these allocations will reduce envy.
2. Allocate remaining items, balancing the total value each agent receives.

Given the table:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (96), so allocate it to Agent 0.
- Agent 4 values item 1 (97) the most, so allocate it to Agent 4.
- Agent 2 values item 5 (85) highly, so allocate it to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 (89), so allocate it to Agent 3.
  
Now distribute remaining items:
- Item 4 is valued highly by Agent 2 (80), so allocate it to Agent 2.
- Item 2 is valued highly by Agent 2 (90), but since Agent 2 already has high-value items, let's give it to Agent 0 (who values it at 65).
- Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 4 (47), so allocate it to Agent 4.

Let's see the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 0, 1

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent has at least one item they value highly, and no agent significantly envies another for the given distribution of items.
