Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  70  29  71  81  70   8
1  94  94  44  29  33   4  32
2  85  37  91  23  99  54  32
3  13  91  21  39  80  10  97
4  45  46  19  86  51  54  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in an envy-free or fair manner, we can use the strategy of maximizing each agent's minimum satisfaction, commonly termed as a "maximin" strategy. This involves ensuring that each agent receives at least one item that they value highly, and then distributing the remaining items to further balance the allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [77, 70, 29, 71, 81, 70, 8]
Agent 1: [94, 94, 44, 29, 33, 4, 32]
Agent 2: [85, 37, 91, 23, 99, 54, 32]
Agent 3: [13, 91, 21, 39, 80, 10, 97]
Agent 4: [45, 46, 19, 86, 51, 54, 63]
```

To start, assign each agent the item they value most highly:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 0 or item 1 the most, but item 0 will be assigned first.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most, but it is already taken, so assign item 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most.

After this allocation, the items are assigned as follows:

- Agent 0: item 4
- Agent 1: item 0
- Agent 2: item 2
- Agent 3: item 6
- Agent 4: item 3

Remaining items: 1, 5

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0: Assign item 1 (second-highest valuation among remaining items for Agent 0).
- Agent 2: Assign item 5 (next highest among remaining items for Agent 2).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
