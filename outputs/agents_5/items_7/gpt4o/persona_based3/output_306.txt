Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  64  56  68  62  86  89
1  80  89  35   7  91   0  39
2  36  20  40  44  56   5  76
3  91   6  43  65  64   5  86
4  24   5  78  48  79  24  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation, as much as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations. This involves balancing the total valuation of items each agent receives.

First, let's look at the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(81 + 64 + 56 + 68 + 62 + 86 + 89 = 506\)
- Agent 1: \(80 + 89 + 35 + 7 + 91 + 0 + 39 = 341\)
- Agent 2: \(36 + 20 + 40 + 44 + 56 + 5 + 76 = 277\)
- Agent 3: \(91 + 6 + 43 + 65 + 64 + 5 + 86 = 360\)
- Agent 4: \(24 + 5 + 78 + 48 + 79 + 24 + 82 = 340\)

The goal is to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Now, let's try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 6. Let's allocate item 0 and 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 and 4 highly. Let's allocate item 1 and 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** doesn't have particularly high values, but item 2 is relatively high. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0 and 6, which are already allocated to Agent 0. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 3, which is the next best.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 highly, but it is already allocated to Agent 1. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 4, which is a relatively high value for them.

Now, we have:

- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [5]

This allocation uses all items, and ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
