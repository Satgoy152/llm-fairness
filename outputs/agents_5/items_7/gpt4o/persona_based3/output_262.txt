Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13   2  99  85  54  78  77
1  67   4  33  73  58  44  21
2  88  47   5  12  92  65  87
3  53  95  27  16  84  73   4
4  76   4  22  65  56  57  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items to the 5 agents in a way that is fair and considers envy-freeness. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 13 + 2 + 99 + 85 + 54 + 78 + 77 = 408
   - Agent 1: 67 + 4 + 33 + 73 + 58 + 44 + 21 = 300
   - Agent 2: 88 + 47 + 5 + 12 + 92 + 65 + 87 = 396
   - Agent 3: 53 + 95 + 27 + 16 + 84 + 73 + 4 = 352
   - Agent 4: 76 + 4 + 22 + 65 + 56 + 57 + 78 = 358

2. **Determine Fair Allocation Strategy:**
   - Aim for envy-freeness where possible by comparing item values and distributing them to maximize individual agent satisfaction relative to others.

3. **Allocate Items Based on Valuations:**
   - Item 2 (highest value for Agent 0) -> Agent 0
   - Item 4 (highest value for Agent 2) -> Agent 2
   - Item 1 (highest value for Agent 3) -> Agent 3
   - Item 0 (highest value for Agent 1) -> Agent 1
   - Item 3 (second-highest value for Agent 4) -> Agent 4
   - Item 5 (second-highest value for Agent 4) -> Agent 4
   - Item 6 (remaining item with high relative value for Agent 2) -> Agent 2

4. **Check Allocation:**
   - Ensure that every item is allocated exactly once and each agent receives an integer number of items.

5. **Present the Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair distribution of items based on their individual valuations, considering envy-freeness where feasible.
