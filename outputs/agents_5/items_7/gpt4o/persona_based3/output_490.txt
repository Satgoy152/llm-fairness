Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  98  84  48  25  94  56
1  31  58  53  99  20  69  29
2  36  91   5  87  58  93  94
3   9  76  58  83  19  62  19
4  65  76  96  27  84  56  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations provided, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

A possible method to achieve this is by using the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or by attempting to balance the perceived value each agent receives. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has a high valuation for items 1 and 5.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values item 3 the most.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highly values items 5 and 6.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Has a relatively high valuation for item 3, but it's lower than Agent 1's valuation.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highly values items 2 and 6.

### Allocation Strategy:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it the most compared to others.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2, since they value it highly.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 4, as they value it significantly.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 4, as they have a relatively high value for it compared to other agents.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation for it.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3, as it provides them with a better distribution considering other allocations.

This allocation attempts to balance the total perceived value among agents, trying to ensure no agent feels significantly envious of another's allocation.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, considering the constraints.
