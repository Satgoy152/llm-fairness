Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  34  84  35  45  92  77
1  70  71  48  40   1  13   2
2  41  46  24  11  92  63  24
3  20  36  64  28  32   2  11
4  98  25  39  44  84  11  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a method such as the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or "Round Robin" allocation. However, due to the constraint of integer allocation, we need a practical approach here. Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, based on their valuations.

Here's an allocation strategy:

1. **Maximize Individual Satisfaction**: Start by giving each agent the item they value the most, preventing overlaps if possible.
2. **Balance Remaining Allocations**: Allocate the remaining items to balance total values as much as possible.

Let's break down the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 5 the most (92), then item 2 (84).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the most (71).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the most (92).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the most (64).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 0 the most (98).

Initial allocation based on highest individual values:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 0

Remaining items: 3, 6

Distribute remaining items to balance values:

- Agent 0: Already has high value from item 5.
- Agent 1: Can receive item 3 (40) to increase value.
- Agent 2: Can receive item 6 (24) to increase value.

Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent while adhering to the constraints.
