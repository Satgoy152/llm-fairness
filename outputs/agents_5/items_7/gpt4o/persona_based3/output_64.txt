Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  52  16  82  74  16  10
1  73  33   2  58  92  34  68
2  98  81  84  10  15  34  94
3  97  14  28  94  28  74  10
4  36  89  40  48  16  89  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 52 16 82 74 16 10]
 [73 33  2 58 92 34 68]
 [98 81 84 10 15 34 94]
 [97 14 28 94 28 74 10]
 [36 89 40 48 16 89 38]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, meaning that each agent should feel that they have received a fair share based on their valuations. In this context, we will attempt to assign items such that no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

Given the valuation table, we can use a heuristic approach to find an allocation that minimizes envy. One common approach is to iteratively assign items to the agent who values them the most, considering what other items have already been allocated to each agent.

Let's evaluate the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value by agent 2 (98), assign to agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value by agent 4 (89), assign to agent 4.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value by agent 2 (84), assign to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value by agent 3 (94), assign to agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value by agent 1 (92), assign to agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value by agent 4 (89), assign to agent 4.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value by agent 2 (94), assign to agent 2.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 2, and 6.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives items 1 and 5.

Let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by prioritizing agents' highest-valued items.
