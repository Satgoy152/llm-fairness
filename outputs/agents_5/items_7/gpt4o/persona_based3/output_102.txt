Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  36  74  43  61  58  55
1  58  96  67  73  12  66  13
2  67  25  67  52  74   3  89
3  94  76  65  96  78  64  96
4  31  63  60   3  13   5  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, one common approach is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" or "Round Robin" method. Given the valuations provided, we will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their share.

To start, we note that there are 5 agents and 7 items, meaning some agents will necessarily receive more items than others. Our goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels envy towards another's allocation based on their own preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on the perceived value each agent has for the items:

1. Identify the highest-valued item for each agent and try to allocate it if possible.

2. If two agents value an item similarly, try to allocate based on the next highest available valued item.

3. Try to ensure each agent gets at least one item, if their perceived value allows it.

Below is the allocation based on the above guidelines:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (74), so they receive item 2.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (96), so they receive item 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (89), so they receive item 6.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (94), so they receive item 0.
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly (63) but it's taken, so they take item 4 (13).

Now, we have items 3 and 5 remaining to be allocated:

- Item 3 is valued highly by Agent 3 (96), so they receive item 3.
- Item 5 is valued by Agent 0 (58), so they receive item 5.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints.
