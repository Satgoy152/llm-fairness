Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  29  73  48  47  45  49
1  33   1  37  86  97  47  15
2  92  39  87  50  64  85  20
3   6  77  75   3  26   5  51
4  74  85  62  25  96  25  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [74 85 62 25 96 25 84]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to consider envy-freeness and maximize the total value each agent derives from their allocated items. The goal is to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuation of the items.

The table of valuations is as follows:

```
Agent 0: [70, 29, 73, 48, 47, 45, 49]
Agent 1: [33, 1, 37, 86, 97, 47, 15]
Agent 2: [92, 39, 87, 50, 64, 85, 20]
Agent 3: [6, 77, 75, 3, 26, 5, 51]
Agent 4: [74, 85, 62, 25, 96, 25, 84]
```

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we allocate the most valued item to each agent iteratively until all items are allocated. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 0 (92). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4 (97). Assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 1** also has the highest valuation for item 3 (86). Assign item 3 to agent 1.
4. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2 (73). Assign item 2 to agent 0.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 1 (85). Assign item 1 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5 (85). Assign item 5 to agent 2.
7. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 6 (84). Assign item 6 to agent 4.

After this allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Items 1, 6

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value highly, leading to a fair division where we consider each agent's preferences.
