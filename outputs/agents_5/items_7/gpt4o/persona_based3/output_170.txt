Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  92  91  24  72  66  59  84
1  34  26  89  65  92  29  24
2  83  48  15  26  51  81  21
3   1  24  11  45  56   8  63
4  93  88  18   9  72  32  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. One approach to achieve this is the "Envy-Free Item Allocation" method, ensuring that each agent feels they are at least as well-off with their allocation compared to others.

Given the valuation matrix, we'll consider each agent's highest-valued items first and attempt to allocate those while ensuring that no agent is left significantly worse off compared to others:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 1, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 4 and 2.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 0 and 5.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 6.
5. **Agent 4** highly values items 0, 1, and 4.

### Allocation Steps:
- **Item 0**: This item is highly valued by agents 0, 2, and 4. To minimize envy, we will allocate it to **Agent 4**, who values it the most.
- **Item 1**: This item is highly valued by agents 0 and 4. Allocate it to **Agent 0**, who values it highly.
- **Item 2**: Allocated to **Agent 1**, who values it significantly.
- **Item 3**: Not highly valued by any agent but can be allocated to **Agent 3** due to them having fewer high-value options.
- **Item 4**: Allocated to **Agent 1**, as they value it the highest.
- **Item 5**: Allocated to **Agent 2**, as it is among their highest-valued items.
- **Item 6**: Allocated to **Agent 0**, as they also value it highly.

### Final Allocation:
The allocations are made ensuring all agents have some items and the envy is minimized as much as possible.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the number of items allocated matches the total number of available items (7 items in total).
