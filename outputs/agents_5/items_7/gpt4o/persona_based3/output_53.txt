Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  31  85  12  32  72   1
1   6  33  16  62  39  42  25
2  10  88  84  10  37  43   0
3  45  62  97  77  29  49  93
4  99  81   4  21  27  15  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can employ an algorithm that ensures each agent receives items such that they are not envious of another agent's share based on their individual valuations. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, we can use the following heuristic approach:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Calculate the fair share for each agent by dividing the total value of all items by the number of agents. Then, assign items to agents based on their highest individual valuations while ensuring that each agent's total valuation is close to their fair share.

2. **Iterative Redistribution**: Adjust the allocation iteratively to minimize envy. This might involve swapping items between agents to improve the envy-free condition.

3. **Final Check**: Ensure that exactly 7 items are allocated in total with each item assigned to exactly one agent.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Calculate the total value of all items: 
   ```
   Total value = 21 + 31 + 85 + 12 + 32 + 72 + 1 
               + 6 + 33 + 16 + 62 + 39 + 42 + 25
               + 10 + 88 + 84 + 10 + 37 + 43 + 0
               + 45 + 62 + 97 + 77 + 29 + 49 + 93
               + 99 + 81 + 4 + 21 + 27 + 15 + 85
               = 1443
   ```

2. Calculate the fair share for each agent:
   ```
   Fair share per agent = Total value / Number of agents = 1443 / 5 = 288.6
   ```

3. Assign items considering each agent's highest valuations and ensuring total valuations are close to the fair share.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valued items are 2 (85) and 5 (72). Total valuation = 157.
- **Agent 1**: Highest valued item is 3 (62). Total valuation = 62.
- **Agent 2**: Highest valued items are 1 (88) and 2 (84). Total valuation = 172.
- **Agent 3**: Highest valued item is 2 (97). Total valuation = 97.
- **Agent 4**: Highest valued item is 0 (99). Total valuation = 99.

Since we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and exactly 7 items must be allocated, let's adjust the allocation to balance it better.

### Adjusted Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 5] (Items 2 and 5 valued at 85 and 72, respectively)
- **Agent 1**: [3, 6] (Items 3 and 6 valued at 62 and 25, respectively)
- **Agent 2**: [1] (Item 1 valued at 88)
- **Agent 3**: [4] (Item 4 valued at 29)
- **Agent 4**: [0] (Item 0 valued at 99)

This revised allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that attempts to minimize envy based on their valuations and respects the integer allocation constraint.

### Final JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
