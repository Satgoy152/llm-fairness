Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  90  82  72  46   2  26
1  88  20  65  89  94  99  14
2  81  78  63  27  36  91  72
3  64   7  32  72  87  89  36
4  34   2  50  56  43  36  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. 

One common approach is the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued available item. However, to ensure that allocations are as balanced as possible, we will tailor the distribution according to the valuations given in the table.

Here is a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 (value 90). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 5 (value 99). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 5, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 0 (value 81). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 5, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 4 (value 87). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 2 (value 50). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 0**: Next highest available for Agent 0 is item 2, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 3 (value 72). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1**: The next highest available for Agent 1 is item 4, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 3, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 6 (value 14). Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

After these allocations, all items are distributed. Let's summarize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, while also ensuring all items are distributed.
