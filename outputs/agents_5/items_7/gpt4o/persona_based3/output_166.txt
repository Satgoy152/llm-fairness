Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  95  18  53   2  58  58
1  11  22  34  70  99   0   1
2  26  40  28  35  68  78  47
3  97  54   6  64  83  55  49
4  44  32  83  78  54  66  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent feels that they have received the best possible allocation given their valuations. One way to achieve this is through a method called the "Envy-Free Carving Procedure" or similar iterative methods, where we attempt to minimize envy by considering the valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Valuations Matrix:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29  95  18  53   2  58  58
1  11  22  34  70  99   0   1
2  26  40  28  35  68  78  47
3  97  54   6  64  83  55  49
4  44  32  83  78  54  66  74
```

We aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences. Here's an allocation strategy that aims to be fair:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 1, so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4, so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 5, so allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 0, so allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 2, so allocate item 2 to agent 4.

Now, two items remain unallocated: items 3 and 6.

6. For item 3: 
   - Agent 4 values it second highest after item 2, so allocate item 3 to agent 4.

7. For item 6:
   - Agent 2 values it significantly, so allocate item 6 to agent 2.

This allocation attempts to respect the highest item valuations for each agent, thereby reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
