Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  93  31  77  74  11  15
1  28  63  95  72  98  40  82
2  28  47  30   8  63  94  76
3  11  62  87  20  79  16   6
4  97  52  95  91  83  55   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items while considering envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "round robin" or "sequential allocation" approach. This ensures that each agent gets a fair chance of selecting the items based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process considering each agent's valuation:

1. **Agent 4**: Choose item 0 (97, highest value for any single item).
2. **Agent 1**: Choose item 4 (98, highest remaining value).
3. **Agent 2**: Choose item 5 (94, highest remaining value).
4. **Agent 4**: Choose item 2 (95, second highest value for agent 4).
5. **Agent 3**: Choose item 3 (20, highest value remaining for agent 3).
6. **Agent 1**: Choose item 6 (82, second highest value for agent 1).
7. **Agent 0**: Choose item 1 (93, highest remaining value).

This allocation method tries to distribute the items based on the agents' preferences and ensures that each agent gets a fair chance to pick their preferred items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
