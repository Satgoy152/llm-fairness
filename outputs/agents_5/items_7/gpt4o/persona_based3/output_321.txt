Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  20  55  47  55  15  11
1  49  26  99  17  43  48  83
2  93  36  26  35  86  89  18
3  44  53   7  46  84  40  11
4  54  76  86  77  41  43  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[94 20 55 47 55 15 11]
 [49 26 99 17 43 48 83]
 [93 36 26 35 86 89 18]
 [44 53  7 46 84 40 11]
 [54 76 86 77 41 43 85]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations table, we can use a heuristic approach to allocate the items by maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring every item is allocated.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at their valuations, agent 0 values item 0 the highest, so we assign item 0 to them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the highest, so we assign item 2 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 5 the highest, so we assign item 5 to them.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 the highest, so we assign item 4 to them.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 1 the highest, so we assign item 1 to them.

Now, we have two items left (items 3 and 6) to allocate. Let's check the remaining preferences:

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 47
  - Agent 1: 17
  - Agent 2: 35
  - Agent 3: 46
  - Agent 4: 77

  Agent 4 values item 3 the most, so we assign it to them.

- Item 6:
  - Agent 0: 11
  - Agent 1: 83
  - Agent 2: 18
  - Agent 3: 11
  - Agent 4: 85

  Agent 4 values item 6 the most, so we assign it to them.

After this allocation, we ensure each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 3, 6]
}
```
