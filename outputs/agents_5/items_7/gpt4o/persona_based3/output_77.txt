Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  98  66  48  98  36  39
1  74  91   1  90  36  32  19
2  35  77  53  92  94  73  99
3  26  63  14  21  11   1  48
4  70  10  62  94  21  66  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that is as fair as possible, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible. Given that we have 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others, so we aim for an allocation that balances the total value across agents.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items iteratively to the agent who values them the most, keeping track of the items already assigned and ensuring fairness is maintained as much as possible.

Let's evaluate the valuations and make an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values the items quite highly on average, especially item 1 and item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the most.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the most.
4. **Agent 3**: Has relatively low valuations across the board.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 highly.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 0 (98).
- **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 2 (92), but Agent 4 also values it (94), so give it to Agent 4 for balance.
- **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 2 (94).
- **Item 6**: Highest value by Agent 2 (99).
- **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 0 (82).
- **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 0 (66).
- **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 4 (66).

Reevaluate and redistribute if necessary for fairness:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1, 2
- Agent 1: No items yet, but is a good candidate for items not highly valued by others.
- Agent 2: Items 4, 6
- Agent 3: No items yet, but valuations are generally low.
- Agent 4: Items 3, 5

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives every agent a fair opportunity to receive highly valued items while distributing based on the highest valuation preference, aiming to balance fairness and efficiency.
