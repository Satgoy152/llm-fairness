Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  39  47  39  88  64  36
1  66  13  43  62  39  96  27
2  94  27   6  29  19  18  38
3  59  65  21  72  64  75  65
4  19  97  66  90  68  71  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of these items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. This typically means trying to ensure each agent receives items that have high value to them relative to what others receive. A common approach to achieving a fair distribution is to apply the "envy-free" criterion, where each agent should feel that their bundle is at least as good as anyone else's bundle, according to their own valuation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to find such an allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
    - There are 5 agents and 7 items.
    - Each agent should ideally get at least one item, but since there are 7 items and 5 agents, some will get more than one.

2. **Valuation Table**:
    - Re-collect the highest value items for each agent and try to assign them to avoid envy.

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
    - Start by identifying which items are most valuable to each agent.
    - Assign the most valued item to each agent first, if possible.
    - Distribute remaining items in a way that balances the overall value each agent receives.

4. **Implementation**:
    - Assign the highest valued item from each row to the respective agent.
    - Then, assign the remaining items to minimize envy.

5. **Allocation**:
    - Assign the items to ensure each agent is getting a reasonably fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation based on these steps:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives item 4, which is the highest value (88) for them.
- Agent 1 receives item 5, their highest value (96).
- Agent 2 receives item 0, which is their highest value (94).
- Agent 3 receives items 3 and 6, with values (72, 65), balancing their allocations.
- Agent 4 receives items 1 and 2, with high values (97, 66) for them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are valuable to them, and the distribution attempts to minimize envy across agents.
