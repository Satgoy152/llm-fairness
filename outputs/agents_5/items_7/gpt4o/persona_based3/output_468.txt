Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  64  38  78  88  34  51
1  87  95  10  34  68   2  88
2  36  30  46  56  58  88  33
3  99  74  89  55  15  13  18
4  51  68  65  83  87  61  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute them such that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own.

Given the agents' valuations, we can use an algorithmic approach like the "Round Robin" method, where agents take turns choosing their most valued unallocated item. However, since we have 5 agents and 7 items, some agents may end up with more than one item, while others may have none.

Let's proceed with a simple heuristic approach, considering maximizing individual utilities, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 3**: The highest single valuation is by Agent 3 for item 0 (99). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 1**: The next highest valuation is by Agent 1 for item 1 (95). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 4**: The next highest valuation is by Agent 4 for item 4 (87). Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
4. **Agent 0**: The next highest valuation is by Agent 0 for item 4 (88), but it's already taken, so we assign their next highest item, item 3 (78), to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 2**: The next highest available valuation is by Agent 2 for item 5 (88). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the next highest remaining valuation for item 4 (88), but it's already taken. Their next high is item 1, but it's also taken, so we assign item 6 (51) to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 2**: Agent 2's next high is item 2 (46). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [3, 6]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [5, 2]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [4]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints and ensures all items are allocated.
