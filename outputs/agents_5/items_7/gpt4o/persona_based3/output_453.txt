Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  11  31  68  62  63  16
1  31  99  44  37  50  72  67
2  14  64  25  32  60  99  12
3  49  96  84  78   6  33  43
4  69  30  46  89  57   1  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 96 84 78  6 33 43]
 [69 30 46 89 57  1 73]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own allocation.

Given the valuations matrix, we will aim to allocate items so that no agent envies another, if possible, and each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest at 84. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest at 99. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the highest at 99. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest at 96, which is already allocated. The next highest is item 2 at 84. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest at 89. Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, the remaining items are 4 and 6. We will distribute them to minimize envy:

- **Agent 1** values item 6 next highest at 67. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** values item 4 next highest at 62. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

With this allocation, each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```
