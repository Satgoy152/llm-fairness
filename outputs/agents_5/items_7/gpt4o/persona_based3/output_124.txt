Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  27   1  32  50  42  91
1  65  38  37  45  74  32  16
2  83  13  92  87  61  83  19
3  57  69  31  51  69  81  92
4  81  76  57  35  47   8  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Here's one way to achieve this:

First, let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 has a strong preference for item 6.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6, but since Agent 0 has a stronger preference, we will look at item 5 for Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 and 1 highly, but since Agent 1 values item 0 the most, we will give item 1 to Agent 4.

We can start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent based on their preferences:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (second highest value for Agent 3 as item 6 is taken).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (highest value for Agent 4 as item 0 is taken).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 3 and 4:

- Item 3: Check which agent would prefer this item and does not already have a highly valued item. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (as it is their second-highest valued item and would increase the total value for Agent 2).
- Item 4: Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (as it is their third-highest valued item and would increase their allocation value).

Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all 7 items are allocated.
