Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  34  46  33  45  17  20
1   8  23   2  25  76  51  27
2  61  59  95  35  90  37  38
3  96  90  73  54  71  58  16
4  32   5   8  56  76  77  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation of the items among the 5 agents, we can consider the valuations provided and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their individual valuations. This means we try to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes their total perceived value while ensuring all items are distributed. 

Here's one possible allocation strategy that attempts to satisfy these conditions:

1. **Agent 0**: While Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0, this item might be more critical to another agent with fewer high-value options. Instead, we'll look to allocate items that are less competitive for other agents but still provide reasonable value for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 quite highly compared to their valuation for other items. Assigning item 4 to Agent 1 might minimize potential envy.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 2. Allocating this item to them would likely maximize their perceived fairness.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 places high value on item 0. Allocating item 0 to them would be beneficial.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values items 5 and 6 reasonably well compared to other agents, so these might be assigned to them.

Here's a potential allocation based on the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1]
- **Agent 1**: Items [4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2]
- **Agent 3**: Items [0, 3]
- **Agent 4**: Items [5, 6]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item (or none, if it leads to a fairer distribution).

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This solution attempts to align with the principles of fair division by considering high-value allocations for each agent to reduce envy and maximize perceived fairness.
