Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80   2  72  80  26  50  55
1  38   4  97  96  92  38  26
2  82  92  14  27   5  56  86
3  28  56  58  68  76  55  36
4  22  86  71  73  17  22   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure allocations are envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Let's examine the valuations to guide our allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 0 and 3 highly (80 each).
- Agent 1 values item 2 most highly (97), followed by item 3 (96).
- Agent 2 values item 1 most highly (92), followed by item 6 (86).
- Agent 3 values item 4 most highly (76).
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly (86), followed by item 3 (73).

Given the above preferences, let's distribute the items:

1. **Agent 1** should get item 2, as they value it the most (97).
2. **Agent 2** should get item 1, as they value it highly (92), and this also prevents Agent 4 from envying them because Agent 4 also values item 1 highly.
3. **Agent 0** should get item 0, which they value highly (80).
4. **Agent 3** should get item 4, which they value the most (76).
5. **Agent 4** should get item 3, as they value it highly (73).
6. **Agent 0** can take item 5, which is another item they value decently (50).
7. **Agent 2** can take item 6, which they value highly (86).

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's most valued items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, with adjustments to minimize potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives their fair share based on their valuations.
