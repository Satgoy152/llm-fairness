Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  71  55  80  24  88  63
1  79  48  99  42  85   0  17
2   6  79  72   5  94  68   6
3  68  18  43  66  68  72  85
4  35  30  27  64  91  99  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we can use concepts from fair division, such as maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives or ensuring envy-freeness where possible. Given the constraints, we'll aim for a balanced distribution of items based on the valuations provided. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by calculating the total value each agent would receive if they were to get each item.
2. Consider each agent's highest valued items while ensuring no two agents are assigned the same item.
3. Aim to balance out the allocations by assigning items in such a way that no agent feels significantly envious of another.

Using these principles, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly (88).
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly (99).
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly (94).
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly (85).
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly (99), but since item 5 is already assigned, we can assign item 6 (85), which is a tie with Agent 3.
- Agent 3 can also get item 3 (66), which they value highly.
- Assign remaining items in a way to balance the overall distribution.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation balances out the high-value items while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no more than two, and all 7 items are allocated.
