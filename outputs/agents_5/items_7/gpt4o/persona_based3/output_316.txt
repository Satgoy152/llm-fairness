Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  15  23   3  68  48  19
1  68  89  96  68   5  53  79
2   2  96  43  36  47  91  74
3  42  62  47  80  90   4  21
4  36  87  69  83  65   0  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents such that the allocation is fair and possibly envy-free. Since there are more items than agents, each agent will not receive the same number of items, but we should aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness based on the given valuations.

The key concepts here are:
1. **Fairness**: Each agent should feel that they are receiving at least as much value as any other agent, based on their own valuations.
2. **Envy-freeness**: An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

Let's analyze the valuations and find an allocation that tries to balance these criteria:

```
Agent 0: [94, 15, 23, 3, 68, 48, 19]
Agent 1: [68, 89, 96, 68, 5, 53, 79]
Agent 2: [2, 96, 43, 36, 47, 91, 74]
Agent 3: [42, 62, 47, 80, 90, 4, 21]
Agent 4: [36, 87, 69, 83, 65, 0, 84]
```

To ensure a fair allocation, we can employ a method similar to the "Envy-Free Cake-Cutting" approach, where we try to allocate items that maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 (94). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 (96). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 (96). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 4 (90). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 3 (83). Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate 2 more items.

6. **Remaining Items**: Items 5 and 6 are left. Let's assign them based on the remaining highest values:

   - **Item 5**: The highest remaining valuation is for Agent 2 (91). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
   - **Item 6**: The highest remaining valuation is for Agent 1 (79). Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2, 6]
- Agent 2: [1, 5]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [3]

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their own valuations. It might not be perfectly envy-free, but it maximizes fairness given the constraints.

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
