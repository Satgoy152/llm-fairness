Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  79  16  78  29  43  31
1  44  36  20  83   7  84  55
2  95  23  76  49  45  43  56
3  86  10  58  95  33  88  85
4   4  39  19  19  10  63  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, meaning that each agent should feel they received a fair share based on their valuations. This involves considering each agent's preferences and trying to distribute the items in a manner where the perceived value is balanced.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:** Look at each agentâ€™s highest valued items and attempt to allocate them accordingly, ensuring that these allocations don't lead to significant envy.

2. **Allocate Unique High-Value Items:** If an item is highly valued by only one agent, allocate it to that agent if possible.

3. **Balance Remaining Items:** Once key items are allocated, distribute the remaining items by balancing the total value each agent perceives from their allocation.

4. **Iterative Adjustments:** Adjust allocations iteratively to ensure that no agent feels another has received a significantly better deal.

Given the table of valuations:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  79  16  78  29  43  31
1  44  36  20  83   7  84  55
2  95  23  76  49  45  43  56
3  86  10  58  95  33  88  85
4   4  39  19  19  10  63  57
```

**Proposed Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
  - (Highest value for item 1, significant value for item 2)
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
  - (Highest value for item 3, competitive value for item 6)
- Agent 2: Item 0
  - (Highest value for item 0)
- Agent 3: Item 5
  - (Highest value for item 5)
- Agent 4: Item 4
  - (Item 4 is not highly valued, but balances the allocation)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in such a way that their perceived value is as balanced as possible given their preferences.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**
```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```
