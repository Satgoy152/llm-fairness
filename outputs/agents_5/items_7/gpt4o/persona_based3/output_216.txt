Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65   5  29  43  74  92  50
1  87  54  20  39  79  52  61
2  60  46  13  57  25  10   2
3  11  40  98  90  40  45  63
4   5  26  15  24  50   0  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation of items over their own. Given the valuation matrix, we will proceed to allocate the items in such a way that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation on items 4 and 5 (74 and 92 respectively).
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation on items 0 and 4 (87 and 79 respectively).
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation on items 0 and 3 (60 and 57 respectively).
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation on items 2 and 3 (98 and 90 respectively).
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation on items 6 and 4 (91 and 50 respectively).

Based on these observations, we allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (highest valuation at 92).
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (highest valuation at 87).
- Agent 3 gets item 2 (highest valuation at 98).
- Agent 4 gets item 6 (highest valuation at 91).
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (highest valuation at 57).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 4:

- Agent 1 can take item 4 (valued at 79, which is their second-highest remaining).
- Agent 0 can take item 1 (valued at 5, since it's the least contentious and they already have a high-value item 5).

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that approximates fairness based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.
