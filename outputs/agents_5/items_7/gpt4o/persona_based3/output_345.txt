Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  44  82  66  47  66  95
1  96  55  29  26  24   3  34
2  70  77  88   4  42   1  72
3  11  11  18  94   2  44  54
4  44  22  11  14  59  47  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items to the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or at least minimizes envy as much as possible. This often involves finding a balance between the agents' valuations and the number of items each agent receives. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, we will proceed with the following allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 6 the most with a valuation of 95.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 0 the most with a valuation of 96.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 2 the most with a valuation of 88.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 3 the most with a valuation of 94.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 4 the most with a valuation of 59.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 5. We'll choose the allocation that minimizes envy:

- **Item 1**: Allocating this to Agent 2 balances their total value slightly better since they've received item 2 already. Hence, Agent 2 gets item 1 as well.
- **Item 5**: Allocating this to Agent 4 provides them with a relatively higher valuation compared to others, reducing potential envy.

Therefore, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while considering their preferences and attempting to minimize envy.
