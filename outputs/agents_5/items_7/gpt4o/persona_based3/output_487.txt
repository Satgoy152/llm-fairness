Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  55  72  50  31  68  48
1  10  76  28  73  18  61  54
2   4  74  47  60  62  78  90
3  72  75  63  97  37  22  65
4  52  67  52  76  10  27  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own under their given valuations. Given the constraints, we will try to allocate items in a way that respects each agent's preferences as much as possible.

Here is the valuation matrix for clarity:

```
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0           47  55  72  50  31  68  48
1           10  76  28  73  18  61  54
2           4   74  47  60  62  78  90
3           72  75  63  97  37  22  65
4           52  67  52  76  10  27  81
```

To ensure fairness, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify highest valuations:** Start by looking at which item each agent values the most.
2. **Allocate items based on maximizing value:** Try to allocate at least one high-value item to each agent where possible.
3. **Check for envy-freeness:** Ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

### Proposed Allocation

1. **Agent 0:** High values are for items 2 and 5. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** High value is for item 1. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** High value is for item 6. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** High value is for item 3. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** High value is for item 3, but it is already allocated. The next highest is item 6, which is also allocated. We can allocate item 0 which is still valuable to Agent 4.

At this point, items 0, 2, 3, 6, and 1 have been allocated. The remaining items are 4 and 5. We will allocate these to balance the allocation:

6. **Agent 0:** Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0 to further balance their allocation.
7. **Agent 2:** Allocate the remaining item 4 to Agent 2.

### Final Allocation

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving priority to their highest valued items and ensuring that all items are allocated.
