Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  85  78  17   4  69  81  39
1  66  49  21  56  84  84  40
2  91  25  35  40  19  17  97
3  88  79  55  76  78  47  26
4  71  82  87  87  44  61  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among agents, we look for an allocation where each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy among agentsâ€”specifically targeting envy-freeness where possible. Given the constraint that each agent must get an integer number of items and there are 7 items for 5 agents, at least 2 agents will receive 2 items.

### Analysis of Valuations

Here's a brief analysis of how each agent values the items:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 0 and item 5 the highest.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 4 and item 5 the highest.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 0 and item 6 the highest.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 0, item 1, and item 3 highly.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 2 and item 3 the highest.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5. It is one of the highest valued items for Agent 0 and is not the highest for any other agent.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4. It is the joint highest valued item for Agent 1 and not highly valued by most others.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 6. This is the highest valued item for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items 0 and 1. Item 0 is highly valued by several agents, but Agent 3 values it highly and can balance by also taking item 1 which is the second-highest for them.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items 2 and 3. Agent 4 values these items the highest, and they are not the highest valued by any other agent.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by aligning high-value items with the agents that value them the most, while also ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to minimize envy among agents, given their valuations.
