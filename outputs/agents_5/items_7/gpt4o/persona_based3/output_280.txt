Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24   4  25  23  93  87  96
1  56  83   1  68  57  75  17
2  70   4  80  53  37  14  20
3  73  16  80  62  87  34  99
4  78   1  65  57  27  13  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent values their allocation highly while minimizing envy. We'll use a method inspired by the "maximum envy-free" allocation, though perfect envy-freeness might not be possible with integer allocations.

Let's consider the agents' valuations and try to distribute the items according to their preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 6 (value 96), then item 4 (value 93).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 1 (value 83), then item 5 (value 75).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 2 (value 80), then item 0 (value 70).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 6 (value 99), then item 4 (value 87).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 0 (value 78), then item 2 (value 65).

Given these preferences, we can allocate as follows:
- Agent 0 gets item 4 (value 93) because it is highly valued by them and not the top choice of others.
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 83) because it is their top choice.
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 80) because it is their top choice.
- Agent 3 gets item 6 (value 99) because it is their top choice and the highest valuation overall.
- Agent 4 gets item 0 (value 78) because it is their top choice.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items. Considering remaining preferences:
- Agent 0 can take item 3 (value 23).
- Agent 1 can take item 5 (value 75).

This allocation attempts to respect top preferences where possible and ensure each agent receives an item of value.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.
