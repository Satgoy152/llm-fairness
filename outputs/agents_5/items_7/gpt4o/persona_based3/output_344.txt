Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  14  17  52  81  42  62
1  16  60  42  31  48  83  62
2   2   6  78  61  87  29  88
3  65  68  62  98  47  83  90
4  91   9  30   6  19  11  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while attempting to ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to assign items to agents in such a way that maximizes the minimum value each agent receives, or in a way that tries to minimize potential envy.

Given the valuation matrix, let's consider a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuation for item 5.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2 and 6.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 3 and 6.
5. **Agent 4** has high valuation for item 0.

Let's try to allocate items by maximizing the value for each agent, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once, and each agent gets at least one item:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (value 91).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 60).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 78).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value 98).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 81).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 83).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 88).

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly. Now, let's represent this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent gets at least one item.
