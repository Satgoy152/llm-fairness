Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35   7  66  21  27  66   4
1  75   4  51  39  41  71  14
2  13  38  65  75  53  36  25
3  33  29  23  13  21  88  27
4  14  53  96  41  77  14  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 7 items among the 5 agents while considering the valuations provided, we can use a procedure that aims to maximize fairness, possibly considering the concept of envy-freeness or maximizing the total valuation for each agent. A common approach to achieve a fair division is to use the "round-robin" method where agents pick items in turns according to their preferences.

Hereâ€™s a possible fair allocation of the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (75) and should get it.
2. **Agent 4** should get item 2, which they value highest (96).
3. **Agent 2** should get item 3, which they value highest (75).
4. **Agent 3** should get item 5, which they value highest (88).
5. **Agent 0** should get item 6, which they value highest (66).

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 1 and 4:

6. **Agent 4** can take item 4, which they value second-highest (77).
7. **Agent 0** can take item 1, which they value next after item 6 (7).

Now, each item is allocated such that the highest preferences of the agents are prioritized, and each agent receives at least one item as much as possible while ensuring fairness.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
