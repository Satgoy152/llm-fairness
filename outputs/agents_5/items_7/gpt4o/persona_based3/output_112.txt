Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  50   9  70  25  32  78
1   0  62  62   9  18  26  44
2  66   2  34  85  49  49  72
3  75  27  68  29  42  19  57
4  98  93  23  36  74  85   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent gets a bundle of items they value highly.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values items 0 and 3. We can assign these to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values items 2 and 1 equally, but item 1 has a higher valuation from other agents. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 highly, but item 3 is already taken. Assign item 6, which is still valued decently by agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a balanced valuation but doesn't have a standout favorite. Assign item 5, which is not highly valued by other agents.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 4 and item 1. Assign items 4 and 1 to agent 4.

The allocation based on this strategy is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
