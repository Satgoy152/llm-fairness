Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  28  43   0  98  19  42
1  73  92  14  14  76   2  65
2  77  91  79  70  71  90  34
3  67  71  72  27  19  44  20
4  42  27  11  96  46  33  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. One approach to achieve this is to use an algorithm that attempts to maximize the minimum utility each agent receives, often referred to as the maximin or leximin approach. However, given the simplicity of this problem, we can also apply a greedy method that seeks to provide each agent with at least one highly-valued item.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (98) and item 2 (43).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (92) and item 0 (73).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (90) and item 1 (91).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (72) and item 1 (71).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most (96) and item 6 (90).

Considering each agent's high valuations, we can attempt to assign items as follows:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it is their highest valued item.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued item.
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 3, as it is their highest valued item.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 4, as it is their highest valued item.

Now, we have two items left (items 0 and 6), which need to be assigned. Let's distribute them by considering the next highest valuations:

- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0 (73).
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 6 (90).

Assign item 0 to Agent 1 and item 6 to Agent 4.

This allocation attempts to maximize fairness by considering each agent's highest valued items and ensuring that each agent receives at least one of their top choices. Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```
