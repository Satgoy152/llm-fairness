Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  75  54  29  18  95  25
1   4  92  26  12  36  87  84
2  34  77  31  55  75  73  91
3  83  74  49  72  35  66  70
4  89  35  29   4  61  99  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[12 75 54 29 18 95 25]
 [ 4 92 26 12 36 87 84]
 [34 77 31 55 75 73 91]
 [83 74 49 72 35 66 70]
 [89 35 29  4 61 99 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free and proportional distribution. Envy-freeness is achieved when no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. A proportional allocation ensures that each agent receives at least their fair share of the total value.

Given the valuations table, our objective is to allocate the items such that these conditions are approximately satisfied. 

### Valuation Matrix:

| Agent \ Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|--------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0            | 12 | 75 | 54 | 29 | 18 | 95 | 25 |
| 1            | 4  | 92 | 26 | 12 | 36 | 87 | 84 |
| 2            | 34 | 77 | 31 | 55 | 75 | 73 | 91 |
| 3            | 83 | 74 | 49 | 72 | 35 | 66 | 70 |
| 4            | 89 | 35 | 29 | 4  | 61 | 99 | 22 |

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 4** values item 5 highly. Assign item 5 to Agent 4.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 highly. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 highly. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 0** values item 3 next highest. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1** values item 4 next highest. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the items are distributed in a manner that aims to be envy-free and fair.

### JSON Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation is designed to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items that they value highly. Each agent's allocation is based on their highest remaining preferences after other allocations are made.
