Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  85   4  52  45   6  34
1   2  55  65  61  60  23  60
2  33  71  60  14  47   6   5
3  97  41  71  77  37  11  16
4  24  37  94  98  35  21  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the minimum utility each agent receives, aiming for an allocation that approaches envy-freeness.

Valuations Matrix:
```
Agent \ Item     0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0              | 88  85   4  52  45   6  34
1              |  2  55  65  61  60  23  60
2              | 33  71  60  14  47   6   5
3              | 97  41  71  77  37  11  16
4              | 24  37  94  98  35  21  92
```

A reasonable approach is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item to minimize envy.

Let's perform an allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 1.
2. Agent 1 highly values items 2, 3, and 4.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 1.
4. Agent 3 highly values items 0 and 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values items 2, 3, and 6.

Considering the above preferences and the need to allocate all 7 items, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0] (value = 88)
- Agent 1: Items [4] (value = 60)
- Agent 2: Items [1] (value = 71)
- Agent 3: Items [3, 5] (value = 77 + 11 = 88)
- Agent 4: Items [2, 6] (value = 94 + 92 = 186)

The allocations are as follows:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```
This allocation aims to distribute items in a way that maximizes each agent's valuation while ensuring that all items are assigned and each agent receives at least one item. This method may not be perfectly envy-free but seeks to achieve a balance based on relative preferences.
