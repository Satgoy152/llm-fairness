Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  13  29  99  42   6  68
1  87  97  73  41   4   0  28
2  62  28   9   9  47  31  78
3  95  84  80  44   9   0  95
4  16   0  93  31  10   2  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Here is one possible allocation that balances these considerations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - The highest value items for Agent 0 are item 3 (99) and item 6 (68). Allocating item 3 and item 6 to Agent 0 gives them a significant value.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 1 (97). Allocating item 1 to Agent 1 provides them with a high-value item.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 6 (78), but it has already been allocated to Agent 0. The next highest value is item 4 (47). Allocating item 4 to Agent 2 gives them their next best option.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - The highest-value items for Agent 3 are item 0 (95) and item 6 (95). Item 6 has already been allocated. Allocating item 0 to Agent 3 provides a high value.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - The highest-value item for Agent 4 is item 2 (93). Allocating item 2 to Agent 4 maximizes their valuation.

Remaining items to allocate:
- Items: 5

To allocate the remaining item fairly, we can consider the next best available options for the agents:
- Agent 0 has item 5 valued at 6.
- Agent 1 has item 5 valued at 0.
- Agent 2 has item 5 valued at 31.
- Agent 3 has item 5 valued at 0.
- Agent 4 has item 5 valued at 2.

Allocating item 5 to Agent 2 gives them a reasonable additional item.

Given this allocation strategy, we ensure each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is relatively fair considering the valuations. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
