Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  23  98  83  98  65  82
1  66  50  13  30  80  66  63
2  50  49  95  77   4  68  87
3   3  22   6  64  23  32  21
4  35  19  44  95  62  86  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents in a way that is as fair as possible. One common approach for fair allocation is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuation matrix, we should try to allocate items so that each agent is satisfied with their share, if possible. Here is one possible allocation that tries to achieve fairness:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 2, and 4 (each valued at 98). We can start by allocating one of these high-value items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (80) highly. We could allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 (95) highly. We could allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has relatively low valuations, with item 3 (64) being the highest among them. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 (86) highly. We could allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items, trying to balance the allocations:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, who values it highly.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2, who values it at 87.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation tries to give each agent at least one item that they value highly, thereby aiming for envy-freeness as much as possible given the constraints.
