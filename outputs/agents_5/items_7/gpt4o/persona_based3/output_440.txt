Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  20  19  55  77  90   7
1  90  35  12  86  88  31  65
2  78  17  54   2  29  69  53
3   3  63  66  25  17  73  73
4  88  35  27  53  44  60  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we will attempt to assign items based on maximizing individual agent valuations and minimizing envy.

One approach to achieve this is the "Greedy Round-Robin" method, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued item that has not yet been allocated. Given the valuations, we will start with the agent who values any item the most and proceed from there.

Let's analyze the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (value = 90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (value = 86).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value = 78).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value = 66).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value = 88), but item 0 is taken, so next highest is item 3 (value = 53), but item 3 is taken, so next highest available is item 5 (value = 60).

Based on the above picks, we need to ensure all items are allocated and try to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 takes item 5.
- Agent 1 takes item 3.
- Agent 2 takes item 0.
- Agent 3 takes item 2.
- Agent 4 takes item 1 (as item 5 was taken by agent 0).

Now we need to allocate the remaining items, items 4 and 6:

- Item 4: 
  - Highest remaining value is for Agent 1 (value = 88).
- Item 6:
  - Highest remaining value is for Agent 3 (value = 73).

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
``` 

Each agent gets items based on their highest valuations, subject to availability, while trying to maintain fairness.
