Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  41  92  23  37  44  92
1  23  44  14   1  85  59  25
2   1  40  71  87  39  58  81
3   2  47  78  22  52  31  86
4  37  34  22  72  42  74  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while minimizing envy, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their bundle highly, and the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** has a high value for items 0, 2, and 6.
- **Agent 1** values item 4 the most.
- **Agent 2** shows high preference for items 2, 3, and 6.
- **Agent 3** values items 2 and 6 highly.
- **Agent 4** has a higher preference for item 5.

A possible allocation can be as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: We can assign items that they value highly and others value less, such as item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 4, which has the highest value for this agent and is not highly valued by others.
3. **Agent 2**: Since they value item 3 highly and others do not, assign it to them.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 is highly valued by both Agent 0 and Agent 3, but Agent 3 has fewer high-value items overall, so assign item 2.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 5, which is more highly valued by Agent 4 than by others.

We need to ensure that all items are assigned:

- Agent 0: Assign item 0, as Agent 0 values it highly.
- Agent 1: Assign item 1, as it is the next high-value item for Agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they value while making sure all items are allocated.
