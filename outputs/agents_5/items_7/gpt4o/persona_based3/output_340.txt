Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  35  87  18  86  87  75
1  96  48  46  74   3  99  68
2  79  57  93  26  32  87  78
3  24  25  50  68  22   8  34
4  46  65  38  44  98   2  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness might be challenging with integer allocations and specific valuations, we can attempt a balanced approach to distribute the items as equitably as possible based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the table to make decisions on allocations:

1. **Agent 0 Values**: High valuation on items 0, 2, 5.
2. **Agent 1 Values**: High valuation on items 0, 5.
3. **Agent 2 Values**: High valuation on items 2, 5.
4. **Agent 3 Values**: Highest valuation on item 3.
5. **Agent 4 Values**: Highest valuation on item 4.

Given these preferences, we can make allocations in such a way that each agent gets at least one of their most valued items, if possible, and also ensure a distribution that accounts for the total number of items.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 6]. (Values: 94, 75)
- **Agent 1**: Item [5]. (Value: 99)
- **Agent 2**: Item [2]. (Value: 93)
- **Agent 3**: Item [3]. (Value: 68)
- **Agent 4**: Items [1, 4]. (Values: 65, 98)

Each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation tries to respect high-value preferences as much as possible.

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This distribution ensures all 7 items are allocated, with each agent receiving at least one item, based on their highest valuations.
