Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  55  65  95  42  29   2
1  13  48  47  22  47  23  45
2  71  37  95  47  60  56  90
3  22  87  57   9  35  32  42
4  64  28  80  17  98  73  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [64 28 80 17 98 73 41]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where each agent values their items as much as possible, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. One approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that no agent envies another. Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing individual agent valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the most at 95.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the highest at 47.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the highest at 95.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the highest at 87.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 the highest at 73.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- **Remaining Items**: 0, 6

Allocate these based on maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent has at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (value 50, next highest available)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 (value 90, next highest available)

Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 3]
- **Agent 1**: [4]
- **Agent 2**: [2, 6]
- **Agent 3**: [1]
- **Agent 4**: [5]

This allocation maximizes individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives items based on their preferences, achieving as much fairness as possible given the constraints.

{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
