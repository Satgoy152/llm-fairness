Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  36  63  30  40  87  29
1  14  21  93  82  22  16  65
2  37  66   3  56  69  32   6
3  47  45  51   0  25  58  29
4  45  43  53   9  46  97  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to achieve envy-freeness, ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we should consider each agent's relative preferences for the items.

Here's a step-by-step strategy for allocating items:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: Determine which items have particularly high valuations for specific agents. These are items that might be crucial for ensuring envy-freeness.

2. **Initial Assignment Based on Highest Valuation**: Assign each agent the item they value the most, if possible. This helps satisfy each agent's strongest preference early on.

3. **Reallocation and Adjustments**: Check for any imbalances or potential envy situations and adjust allocations to minimize envy. This may involve swapping items between agents or reallocating items that have not yet been assigned.

4. **Finalizing the Allocation**: Ensure all items are allocated and no agent has a reason to envy another's allocation based on their valuations.

Considering the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: 61, 36, 63, 30, 40, 87, 29
Agent 1: 14, 21, 93, 82, 22, 16, 65
Agent 2: 37, 66,  3, 56, 69, 32,  6
Agent 3: 47, 45, 51,  0, 25, 58, 29
Agent 4: 45, 43, 53,  9, 46, 97, 32
```

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Assign High-Valuation Items**:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (87).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (93).
   - Agent 4 values item 5 highly (97), but since item 5 is already taken, we must find an alternative.

2. **Assign Remaining High-Valuation Items**:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most (69).
   - Agent 3 values item 5 (58), but it's already taken; item 0 (47) is next.

3. **Adjust and Finalize**:
   - Allocate the remaining items ensuring each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to others.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 3, 6]
}
```

In this distribution, each agent gets at least one item they value highly, minimizing potential envy across allocations.
