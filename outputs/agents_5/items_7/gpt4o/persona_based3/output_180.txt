Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  43  25  43  70  79  37
1  24  73  94  79  89  63  67
2  95  13  41  43   4  14  88
3  60  45  27  42  88  21  13
4  13   6  90  43  52  70  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to maximize the total utility for each agent as per their valuations. This is not always perfectly possible, but we can attempt a solution that is as balanced as possible. 

A common approach is to use the Max-Min fair allocation strategy, which tries to maximize the minimum utility any agent receives. Since each agent must receive an integer number of items, we can apply a heuristic to distribute the items fairly.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying which agent has the highest valuation for each item and tentatively assign the item to that agent.
2. Adjust these assignments to ensure each agent ends up with an integer number of items, and no items are left unallocated.

Applying this strategy to the given table:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values this the highest (95).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values this the highest (73).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values this the highest (94).
- Item 3: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value this equally high (43), but Agent 0 has fewer high-value items, so assign it to Agent 0 for balance.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values this the highest (88).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values this the highest (79).
- Item 6: Agent 2 values this the highest (88).

Now, verify that each agent gets at least one item and adjust if necessary:

Given the tentative assignments, we have:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 6
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: No items

Since Agent 4 has nothing, a reallocation can be made to ensure fairness without significantly reducing the utility for others:

1. Swap item 6 from Agent 2 to Agent 4 as Agent 2 already has the highest valued item (0).
2. This maintains the balance without leaving any agent without an item, and only minimally affects Agent 2's overall utility as they retain item 0.

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that 7 items are distributed among the 5 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item and the distribution being as fair as possible given the constraints.
