Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  23  89  36  71  27  43
1  38  87  97  81  15  93  45
2  57  33  76  40  79  62  97
3  14  17  27  15  92  13  29
4  74  47  80  45  86  66  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a method like the Envy-Free Algorithm or similar fair division algorithms. The goal is to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with an allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has higher valuations for items 2 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest followed by item 5.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the highest.
5. **Agent 4** values items 4 and 0 significantly.

Given these valuations, we aim to distribute the items so that the total perceived value for each agent is balanced as much as possible.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. Assign **item 2** to **Agent 1** because they value it the highest.
2. Assign **item 6** to **Agent 2** because they value it the highest.
3. Assign **item 4** to **Agent 3** because it's the only high valuation for them.
4. Assign **item 5** to **Agent 1** because it is their second-highest valued item.
5. Assign **item 0** to **Agent 4** because they value it quite high.
6. Assign **item 3** to **Agent 0** as it balances their total value.
7. Assign **item 1** to **Agent 0** as it adds to their total valued items.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the overall perceived values while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible, and the total allocation sums to 7 items.
