Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  57  77  19  11  57  95  76
1  21  70  33  71  23  16   0
2  27  84  78  14  50  62  68
3  96  30  80  66  23  23  16
4  21  79  65  90   3   4  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we can use a method like the "round-robin" approach. In this method, each agent takes turns picking their most-valued item from the remaining items. This helps to ensure fairness in terms of individual valuations.

Here's the allocation process based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (95), so they get item 5.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (71), so they get item 3.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (84), so they get item 1.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (96), so they get item 0.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (90), but it's already taken. Their next highest value is item 1 (79), but it's also taken. So they get item 2 (65).
6. In the second round, we allocate the remaining items considering the next best preferences:
   - Agent 0's next highest available preference is item 6 (76).
   - Agent 1's next highest available preference is item 0 (21), but it's taken. So their next choice is item 4 (23).
   - Agent 2's next highest available preference is item 6 (68), but it's taken.
   - Agent 3's next highest available preference is item 2 (80), but it's taken. Their next choice is item 4 (23), but it's taken.
   - Agent 4 has no items left for allocation.

After following this procedure, we have:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation assigns all items, and each agent receives at least one item, ensuring a fair distribution according to the given valuations.
