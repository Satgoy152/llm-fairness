Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  40  14  32  61  86  83
1  88  55  68  18  42   3  45
2  92  17   7  47  83  33   3
3  43  39  33  24  98  47  68
4  52  67  54  42  10  97  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels that their share is fair given their valuations. Since we have 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll try to distribute the items to maximize each agent's perceived value.

Let's analyze the valuations:

| Agent | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | Total Valuation |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----------------|
| 0     | 71 | 40 | 14 | 32 | 61 | 86 | 83 | 387             |
| 1     | 88 | 55 | 68 | 18 | 42 | 3  | 45 | 319             |
| 2     | 92 | 17 | 7  | 47 | 83 | 33 | 3  | 282             |
| 3     | 43 | 39 | 33 | 24 | 98 | 47 | 68 | 352             |
| 4     | 52 | 67 | 54 | 42 | 10 | 97 | 63 | 385             |

Let's allocate items to maximize each agent's share of their highest valued items while ensuring each item is allocated only once.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valued items are 5 (86), 6 (83), and 0 (71).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valued items are 0 (88), 2 (68), and 1 (55).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valued items are 0 (92), 4 (83), and 3 (47).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valued items are 4 (98), 6 (68), and 5 (47).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valued items are 5 (97), 1 (67), and 6 (63).

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 5 and 6 (total value 169).
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 0 and 2 (total value 156).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 (total value 47).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 (total value 98).
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 1 (total value 67).

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's perceived value without leaving anyone feeling envious. The allocations ensure each agent receives their top-valued items as much as possible given the constraints.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
