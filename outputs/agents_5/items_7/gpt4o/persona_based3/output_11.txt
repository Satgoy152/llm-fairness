Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  70  64  34  99   4  54
1  44  14  37  93  71   5  47
2  51  27   1  32  28  40  76
3  64  41  13  25   6  79  91
4   5  44  51  45  62   4  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items so that each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly, while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation. Given the valuations, we can use a heuristic approach to distribute the items to the agents.

Let's analyze the valuations and assign items to agents based on maximizing their value and minimizing potential envy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 1 (70) and 4 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations peak at items 3 (93) and 4 (71).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (76).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 6 (91) and 5 (79).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 (95) and item 4 (62) the most.

A potential allocation could be:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as it has the highest valuation among all agents.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, since Agent 1 values it the most.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4, who values it even more than Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3, who values it more than others.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as a second item for balance.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4, as it provides a secondary high value for them.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, given their high valuation for it.

This allocation tries to maximize individual happiness and minimize envy:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives bundles tailored to their high valuations, and all items are allocated.
