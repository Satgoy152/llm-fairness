Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  19  71  50  95  30  55
1  77  51  64  64  55  29  91
2  73  78   6  77  10  58  64
3  60  64  92  40  18   9  66
4   3   4   7  45  67   1  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution, ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This could be challenging due to varying valuations, but we will attempt a solution that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Here is a step-by-step process to distribute the items:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**: We assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives at most one item**: If an agent receives more than one item, we will redistribute items to other agents based on their next highest valuations.

Let's evaluate the items and allocate them:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (94).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (78).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (92).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (77).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (95).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by agent 2 (58).
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (91).

Given these initial assignments, agent 2 has more than one item. We will redistribute:

- Give Item 3 to agent 1 (second highest valuation of 64 for item 3).
- Give Item 5 to agent 3 (second highest valuation of 9 for item 5).

Now let's finalize the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Items [6, 3]
- **Agent 2**: Items [1]
- **Agent 3**: Items [2, 5]
- **Agent 4**: []

This allocation maintains a balance and aims to minimize envy. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": []
}
```
