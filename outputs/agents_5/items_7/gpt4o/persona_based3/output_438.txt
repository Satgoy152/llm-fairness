Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  89   2  37  64  95   3
1  76  91   3  69  56  99  72
2  87   3  64  81  74  41  89
3  42   9  47  44  50   1  89
4  22  34  97  45  75   0  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure each agent receives items they value highly, thereby minimizing envy. We can use a simple algorithm to approach this problem:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items**: This helps in understanding how much each agent values the entire set of items.

2. **Allocate items in a way that maximizes individual satisfaction**: Start by giving each agent the item they value the most and ensure that no agent envies another if possible.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Adjust the allocation iteratively to ensure all items are assigned.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are [56, 89, 2, 37, 64, 95, 3]. The highest valuation is for item 5 (95). Allocate item 5 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are [76, 91, 3, 69, 56, 99, 72]. The highest valuation is for item 5 (99), but it is already taken. The next highest is item 1 (91). Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are [87, 3, 64, 81, 74, 41, 89]. The highest valuation is for item 0 (87). Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are [42, 9, 47, 44, 50, 1, 89]. The highest valuation is for item 6 (89). Allocate item 6 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are [22, 34, 97, 45, 75, 0, 76]. The highest valuation is for item 2 (97). Allocate item 2 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6. Items 3 and 4 are left to be allocated.

- **Agent 1** can receive item 4, as they value it reasonably (56) and it's higher than the remaining agents.

- **Agent 3** can receive item 3, which they value moderately (44).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual item valuations, thereby minimizing potential envy.
