Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  21  94   6   3  52  15
1  89  85  60  86   3  73  52
2  88  60  91  39  48  54  56
3   5  43   9  59  65  59  84
4  69  80  23  92  41  61   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. Since each agent has their own valuation of each item, our goal is to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here’s a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - We have 5 agents and 7 items.
   - Each agent should receive at least one item, if possible, to ensure that the allocations are as fair as possible.

2. **Greedy Allocation**:
   - A simple method to start is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This can give us a baseline and we can adjust from there to ensure fairness.

3. **Adjustments for Fairness**:
   - After the initial allocation, we might need to make adjustments to ensure each agent receives a close-to-equal share in terms of valuation.

4. **Implement the Allocation**:
   - Go through each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, keeping track of the items and their allocations.

Based on the valuation table given, here’s one possible allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (95).
- **Item 1**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (85).
- **Item 2**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (94).
- **Item 3**: Highest value is by Agent 4 (92).
- **Item 4**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (65).
- **Item 5**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (73).
- **Item 6**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (84).

After this initial allocation, we observe:

- Agent 0 has items [0, 2].
- Agent 1 has items [1, 5].
- Agent 2 has no items.
- Agent 3 has items [4, 6].
- Agent 4 has item [3].

To ensure every agent has at least one item, we can make adjustments:

- Transfer item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 also values item 2 highly (91).

Revised allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0]
- **Agent 1**: [1, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: [4, 6]
- **Agent 4**: [3]

This allocation attempts to balance the items among agents and ensure each agent receives at least one item. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
