Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  51  80  28  54  38  36
1  50  30  15  43  77  53  28
2  58  87  54   2  22  81  47
3  55  22  48  46   7  31  72
4  64  54  62  34  96  61   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** Compute the total valuation each agent has for all items. This helps in understanding the relative preferences of each agent.

2. **Use a Greedy Algorithm:** Allocate items one by one to the agent who values the item the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness:** Ensure that no agent envies another agentâ€™s allocation based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

Valuations Matrix:
```
Agent 0: [34, 51, 80, 28, 54, 38, 36]
Agent 1: [50, 30, 15, 43, 77, 53, 28]
Agent 2: [58, 87, 54, 2, 22, 81, 47]
Agent 3: [55, 22, 48, 46, 7, 31, 72]
Agent 4: [64, 54, 62, 34, 96, 61, 5]
```

Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: 321
- Agent 1: 296
- Agent 2: 351
- Agent 3: 281
- Agent 4: 376

Allocation Strategy:
- Since there are 5 agents and 7 items, two agents will receive 2 items each, and the remaining three agents will receive 1 item each.
- Allocate items based on highest valuation first, ensuring distribution across agents.

**Allocations:**

1. Item 4 to Agent 4 (highest valuation 96)
2. Item 1 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation 87)
3. Item 2 to Agent 0 (third highest valuation 80)
4. Item 5 to Agent 2 (since 81 is the next highest and Agent 2 has only one item)
5. Item 0 to Agent 4 (64 is the next highest for an agent with only one item)
6. Item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest for an agent with only one item)
7. Item 6 to Agent 3 (only remaining agent without an item)

Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their high valuations and aims to maintain fairness by giving priority to those with higher total valuations.
