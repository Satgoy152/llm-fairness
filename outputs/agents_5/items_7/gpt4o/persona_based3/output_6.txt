Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  61  17  90   9  26  48
1  25  73  86  97  73  55  57
2  78  54  80  50  78  99  14
3  17  95  83  14  70  62  86
4  71  50  36  64  98  70  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their own valuations and no agent envies another's allocation. Given the constraints, a potential approach is to use the "round-robin" procedure, where each agent sequentially picks their most valued item from the remaining unallocated items until all items are allocated.

Let's process this allocation step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is 90 for item 3.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is 97 for item 3. However, item 3 is already taken, so the next highest valued item for agent 1 is 86 for item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is 99 for item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is 95 for item 1.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is 98 for item 4.

Now, continue the process for another round of allocation with the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1, 4, and 6 remain. The highest value is 61 for item 1, but it's taken. Next highest available is item 0 with a value of 35.
7. **Agent 1**: Items 0, 4, and 6 remain. The highest value is 73 for item 0.
8. **Agent 2**: Items 4 and 6 remain. The highest value is 78 for item 4, but it's taken. Next highest available is item 6 with a value of 14.
9. **Agent 3**: Items 4 and 6 remain. The highest value is 70 for item 4, but it's taken. Item 6 remains with a value of 86.
10. **Agent 4**: All items have been taken.

Let's consolidate the allocations:

Agent 0: [3, 0]  
Agent 1: [2, 4]  
Agent 2: [5]  
Agent 3: [1, 6]  
Agent 4: []  

Here's the finalized JSON output format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": []
}
```
