Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  70  90  34  62  63  14
1   2  61  30  75  27  30  29
2  31  28  92  88  60  16  14
3  10  44  47  57  51  88  20
4  10  50  32  87  57  27  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where an allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. One common method to achieve this is through the Adjusted Winner Procedure or other fair division algorithms.

Given the valuations, we will attempt to allocate the items in such a way that aims to balance the value each agent receives. Since the problem doesn't specify the exact criteria for fairness (e.g., envy-freeness, Pareto efficiency), I'll attempt to distribute items based on maximizing each agent's total value while trying to ensure no agent feels significantly undervalued compared to others.

Here's a potential allocation that considers these factors:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 2 and 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 2 and 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 5 and 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 3.

Attempting to maximize the individual values while distributing the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (70).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3 (75).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 (92).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 5 (88).
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 4 (57).
- Remaining items 0 and 6 need to be allocated to minimize envy and balance the allocation.

From here, let's distribute the remaining items based on least envy and better balance:

- **Agent 0**: Additionally allocate item 0 (24).
- **Agent 1**: Additionally allocate item 6 (29).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items are allocated. This allocation tries to balance the value each agent receives while considering their preferences.
