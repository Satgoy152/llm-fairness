Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  76  64  86  82  93   8
1  70  74  76  49  63  18  20
2  68  86  38  64  15  68  36
3  54   4  49   6  25  65  53
4  81  37  37   0  17  94  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. This can be challenging, but a common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Good" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that any envy can be eliminated by removing at most one item from the envious agent's allocation.

Given the valuations in the table, one possible allocation is:

1. Assign items to agents in a manner that balances the total value received by each agent.
2. Ensure that every agent receives at least one item, if possible, to maintain fairness in distribution.
3. Check that no agent feels significantly envious of another agent's allocation.

Let's proceed with an allocation that tries to balance the total valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations on items 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation on item 2.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation on item 5.
- Agent 3 might be best suited for item 6.
- Agent 4 can take remaining items based on their values.

One possible allocation that meets these requirements is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items so that agents receive items they value highly, while trying to maintain a balance in the perceived value of the allocations. Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 7. This allocation is not strictly envy-free but aims to approximate fairness through balancing high-value items among the agents.
