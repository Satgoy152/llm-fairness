Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  34  91  73  63  16  98
1  69  18   8  36  35  23  38
2  71  72  54  85  20  71  17
3  34  84  44  21  30  79  40
4  37  65  76   1   0  18  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness, given the agents' valuations of the items. A common approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the bundle of any other agent over their own.

Let's analyze each agent's valuation and try to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 6.
- **Agent 1** has relatively lower valuations compared to others, with item 0 as their highest.
- **Agent 2** values item 3 highly.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 the most.
- **Agent 4** values item 6 the most.

Considering these valuations, a possible fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 84), Item 6 (value 98)
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (value 35)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (value 85)
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value 84)
- **Agent 4**: Item 2 (value 76), Item 5 (value 18)

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's format this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the 5 agents while considering their preferences.
