Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  66  98  73   1  69  23
1  13  17  94  33  87  79  39
2   0  78  44  92  61  73  21
3  34  27   0  42  78  97  14
4  74  15  11  82  35   6  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we can use a fair division method such as the envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness might be challenging with indivisible goods and without monetary compensation, we aim to approximate it as closely as possible.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  66  98  73   1  69  23
1  13  17  94  33  87  79  39
2   0  78  44  92  61  73  21
3  34  27   0  42  78  97  14
4  74  15  11  82  35   6  35
```

Let's proceed with a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item the highest at 98. Assign item 2 to agent 0.

2. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item the highest at 87. Assign item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values this item the highest at 92. Assign item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values this item the highest at 97. Assign item 5 to agent 3.

5. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values this item the highest at 74. Assign item 0 to agent 4.

Now, we have 2 more items (1 and 6) to allocate:

6. **Item 1**:
   - Agents' valuations for item 1: 66 (Agent 0), 17 (Agent 1), 78 (Agent 2), 27 (Agent 3), 15 (Agent 4).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 78. Assign item 1 to agent 2.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agents' valuations for item 6: 23 (Agent 0), 39 (Agent 1), 21 (Agent 2), 14 (Agent 3), 35 (Agent 4).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the highest at 39. Assign item 6 to agent 1.

With these allocations, we have assigned all 7 items. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation and is as fair as possible given the constraints of indivisible items and no side payments.
