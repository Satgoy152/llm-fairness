Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  96  11   1  83  98  15
1   5  32  86  68  34  57   1
2   1  21  29  53  17  50  97
3  24   3  42  64  86  37  67
4  71  50  80  46  60  13  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that maximizes fairness and minimizes envy. One approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" criterion, which attempts to minimize the maximum envy experienced by any agent.

Given the valuations, let's consider each agent's preferences and attempt to allocate items in a manner that is as envy-free as possible while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (value 98).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most (value 86).
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the most (value 97).
   - Agent 3 values item 4 the most (value 86).
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the most (value 80), but since Agent 1 values it more and already has it, we consider other items.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Values:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items to Minimize Envy:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (Agent 4 values it 71, which is high compared to others).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it second highest after item 5, and itâ€™s unallocated.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1, who values it 68, which is next highest after item 2.

The allocations aim to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives some of their most valued items, and no agent is left without items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and tries to respect the agents' preferences as much as possible.
