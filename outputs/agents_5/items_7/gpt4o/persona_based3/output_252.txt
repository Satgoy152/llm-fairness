Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3   9  10  63  92  51  51
1  15  15  97  10  37  68  10
2   6  30  65  92  32  94  49
3  81  76  90  34   6   9  93
4  12  43  82  13  62  17   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and distribute items such that each agent values their allocation highly. This is a combinatorial optimization problem where we need to consider the preferences of each agent.

One approach is to use an algorithm like the "Round Robin" method, where each agent takes turns picking their most preferred available item. Given the matrix of valuations, we can attempt to make allocations that appear fair based on maximizing the minimum satisfaction or minimizing envy.

Let's proceed with a strategic allocation:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation of any item with item 0 valued at 81. We allocate **item 0** to **Agent 3**.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 at 97, the highest among all remaining items. We allocate **item 2** to **Agent 1**.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest remaining value of item 5 at 94. We allocate **item 5** to **Agent 2**.
4. **Agent 0** values item 4 the most among the remaining items at 92. We allocate **item 4** to **Agent 0**.
5. **Agent 3** again has a high value for item 6 at 93. We allocate **item 6** to **Agent 3**.
6. **Agent 2** has the highest remaining value for item 3 at 92. We allocate **item 3** to **Agent 2**.
7. **Agent 4** is left with item 1 valued at 43, which is their highest remaining preference. We allocate **item 1** to **Agent 4**.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value, with a focus on minimizing envy and maximizing overall satisfaction based on the given preferences.
