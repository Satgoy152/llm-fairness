Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  86   5  41  87  27  45
1  62  83  35  65  62  27   6
2  75   1  77   6  94  53  84
3  33  13  49  39  40  75  31
4  90   2  46  81  94  38   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a challenging task, especially when the number of items is not a multiple of the number of agents. However, we can try to ensure that each agent receives at least one of their more highly valued items to maintain fairness.

The valuations provided are as follows:

```
Agent 0: [67, 86, 5, 41, 87, 27, 45]
Agent 1: [62, 83, 35, 65, 62, 27, 6]
Agent 2: [75, 1, 77, 6, 94, 53, 84]
Agent 3: [33, 13, 49, 39, 40, 75, 31]
Agent 4: [90, 2, 46, 81, 94, 38, 9]
```

To allocate these items, we will attempt to:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. Ensure that the total distribution equals 7 items.
3. No agent should be left completely without valuable items (as much as possible given the constraints).

Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value 87)
   - Allocation: Item 4

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 83)
   - Allocation: Item 1

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value 94) already taken
   - Next highest value: Item 2 (value 77)
   - Allocation: Item 2

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (value 75)
   - Allocation: Item 5

5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value 94) already taken
   - Next highest value: Item 0 (value 90)
   - Allocation: Item 0

Now, we've allocated 5 items. Two items remain: Item 3 and Item 6. We need to allocate these remaining items to ensure overall fairness.

6. **Agent 0:**
   - Remaining items: Item 3 (value 41), Item 6 (value 45)
   - Choose the higher valued: Item 6
   - Allocation: Item 6

7. **Agent 1:**
   - Remaining item: Item 3 (value 65)
   - Allocation: Item 3

Now, every item is allocated, and we have distributed the items as fairly as possible given the constraints.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```
