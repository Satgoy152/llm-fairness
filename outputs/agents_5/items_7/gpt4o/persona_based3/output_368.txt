Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  76  68  69  52  98  46
1  71  25  94  33  70  58  43
2  50  99  72  50  37  25  41
3   0  56  38  36  10  24  52
4  18   4  67  13   1  93  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences. We'll consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

To achieve this, I'll use a simple algorithm to allocate items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring each agent receives an approximately equal value share.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - There are 7 items to be allocated to 5 agents.
   - We want to minimize envy and try to distribute based on the highest individual item valuations.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign each agent an item they value highly.
   - Try to balance the total value each agent gets.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuation for that item and ensuring no agent receives more than their perceived fair share.

### Allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Assigned to Agent 1 (Value: 71).
2. **Item 1:** Assigned to Agent 2 (Value: 99).
3. **Item 2:** Assigned to Agent 1 (Value: 94).
4. **Item 3:** Assigned to Agent 0 (Value: 69).
5. **Item 4:** Assigned to Agent 0 (Value: 52).
6. **Item 5:** Assigned to Agent 4 (Value: 93).
7. **Item 6:** Assigned to Agent 4 (Value: 86).

### Resulting Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while also distributing the total valuation as evenly as possible among the agents, minimizing potential envy.
