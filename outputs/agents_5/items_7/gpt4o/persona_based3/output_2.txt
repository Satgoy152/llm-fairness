Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  12  66  76  80  42  67
1  11  80  79  46   9  93  73
2  41  77  64  55  41  30  96
3  83  22  63  82  62  69  75
4  91  72  72  24  52   1  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that is envy-free, meaning no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, a possible allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item or as close to an even distribution as possible.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most at 91.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 80.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 66.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 76.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 80.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 93.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.

This allocation attempts to respect the highest valuations while ensuring each agent's preferences are considered based on their valuations.

Let's check the allocation to ensure it is fair and then present it in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation assigns all items to agents based on their highest valuations while attempting to balance the distribution of items. Agent 3 does not receive any items, but given the constraints and preferences, this allocation aims to be as fair as possible.
