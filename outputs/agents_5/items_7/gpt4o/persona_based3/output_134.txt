Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  70  66  72  72   6  21
1  32  36  30  40   7  98  45
2  97  20  67  96  40  61   7
3  15  69  42  36   4  51  95
4  96  51  27  82  72   2  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that envy-freeness is considered, we can use a method that attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives. One approach is to iteratively allocate items to the agent who values them the most while ensuring that no single agent receives an unfair share. This process involves examining the valuations and trying to distribute items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
0: [25, 70, 66, 72, 72, 6, 21]
1: [32, 36, 30, 40, 7, 98, 45]
2: [97, 20, 67, 96, 40, 61, 7]
3: [15, 69, 42, 36, 4, 51, 95]
4: [96, 51, 27, 82, 72, 2, 36]
```

We can proceed as follows:

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 most highly (97), and no other agent values it as much, so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 most highly (98), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** values item 3 most highly (72), tied with item 4, but since item 3 is the highest remaining for them, allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 0** also values item 4 highly (72), and no other agent values it as much, allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 3** values item 6 most highly (95), so allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly (70), allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 4** values item 2 most highly (27), allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their individual valuations while considering fairness and envy-freeness as much as possible with the given constraints.
