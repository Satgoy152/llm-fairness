Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86   7  89  75  10  50  86
1  84   4  30  58  53  53  87
2  10  75  27   8  28  12  78
3  25  15   9  38  87  66  61
4   5  31  90  12  33  84  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we need to consider the valuations that each agent assigns to each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is a step-by-step approach to create an allocation:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: Begin by identifying items that have significantly high valuations for certain agents compared to others. These are strong candidates for allocation to the agents who value them most.

2. **Allocate Based on Preferences**: Attempt to allocate items to agents such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring that no agent is left with nothing unless it's unavoidable.

3. **Ensure Allocation Completeness**: Ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent has been considered in the allocation process.

4. **Adjust for Fairness**: Make adjustments if necessary to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 2, and 6 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most.

Considering these preferences, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2]
- **Agent 1**: Item [6]
- **Agent 2**: Item [1]
- **Agent 3**: Item [4]
- **Agent 4**: Items [3, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly and aims to minimize envy among agents.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```
