Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  38  80  54  81  21  64
1  91  33  32  53  84  32  55
2   1  65   4  49  40  93  77
3  13   2  25  58  43  61  37
4  54  63  29  24  58  12  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a method that minimizes envy. One possible approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's entire bundle over their own, except potentially by removing one item from the other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations, we aim to distribute the 7 items among the 5 agents in a way that respects these principles as closely as possible. 

Here is the allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most (81), so we assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (91), so we assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most (93), so we assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the most (58), so we assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most (63), so we assign item 1 to agent 4.

Now, we have two items left (2 and 6) and need to allocate them to minimize envy:

- Agent 0 can be given item 6 because it has a relatively high value for them (64) compared to others that have already received their most valued items.
- Agent 1 can be given item 2 because it is the next highest value for them (32) after item 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and each item is allocated to only one agent.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation respects the fairness criteria and distributes all 7 items among the 5 agents.
