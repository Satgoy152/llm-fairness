Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  60  93  45  37  75   6
1  21  32  19  67  31  46  22
2  66  63  69  67  28  25  61
3   0  42  72  20  11   0  25
4   9   9  79  58  75  18  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, one approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution. This approach maximizes the product of the utilities of all agents, thereby achieving a fair allocation that tends to minimize envy.

Let's consider the valuation matrix given, and aim to fairly distribute the items among the agents.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [26, 60, 93, 45, 37, 75, 6]
Agent 1: [21, 32, 19, 67, 31, 46, 22]
Agent 2: [66, 63, 69, 67, 28, 25, 61]
Agent 3: [0, 42, 72, 20, 11, 0, 25]
Agent 4: [9, 9, 79, 58, 75, 18, 98]
```

We need to allocate these 7 items among 5 agents.

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest, so assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, so assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest, so assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the highest, which is already taken, next highest is item 1, so assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the highest, so assign item 6 to Agent 4.

Now the remaining items are 4 and 5. We will distribute these based on maximizing the overall utility:

- Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 4 (75), but since Agent 4 already has an item, we will check others. Assign item 4 to Agent 4 as it maximizes utility.
- Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 0 (75) but is already assigned item 2, and Agent 1 values it at 46, so assign item 5 to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to be fair and envy-free to the extent possible given the constraints. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
