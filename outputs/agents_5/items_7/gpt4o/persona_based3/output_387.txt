Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  47  92  90  66   4  90  86
1   1  52  17  90   8  73  24
2  87  80  84   5  88  65  20
3  35  65  85  45  52  27  51
4  73  67  34  44  48  88  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close as possible to being envy-free, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own.

Considering the valuations, a potential approach is to use the method of "maximum envy-free allocation" or try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's one possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items to understand their preferences.
2. Allocate items one by one, aiming to maximize each agent's total valuation while keeping an eye on minimizing envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest, followed by items 2 and 5.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest, followed by item 4.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest.

Based on these observations, the allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 3: Item [2]
- Agent 4: Item [6]

This allocation aims to give each agent their most valued items while ensuring each agent receives some items.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and the total number of allocated items is 7, as required.
