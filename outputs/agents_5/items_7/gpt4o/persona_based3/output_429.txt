Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37   6  64  64  44  43  58
1  43   7  27  33  44  60   0
2  80  80   7  43  10  36  70
3  52   1  81  93  96  15   5
4  48  60  77   4  83   1   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation to their own. Given the constraints and the table of valuations, we can try to ensure the distribution is as balanced as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Valuations: [37, 6, 64, 64, 44, 43, 58]
   - Assign items: [2, 3] (highest total value: 64 + 64 = 128)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: [43, 7, 27, 33, 44, 60, 0]
   - Assign items: [5] (highest value: 60)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [80, 80, 7, 43, 10, 36, 70]
   - Assign items: [0] (highest value: 80)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Valuations: [52, 1, 81, 93, 96, 15, 5]
   - Assign items: [4] (highest value: 96)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Valuations: [48, 60, 77, 4, 83, 1, 0]
   - Assign items: [1, 6] (highest total value: 60 + 0 = 60, but 6 has value 0 to others)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their individual valuation based on available items. The total number of items allocated is 7, which satisfies the requirement.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```
