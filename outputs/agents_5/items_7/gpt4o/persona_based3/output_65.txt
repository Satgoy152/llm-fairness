Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  76  40  70  88  98  43
1  50  86  16  87  66  73  31
2  94  50  46  51  70  81  66
3  49  70  53  21  17  98  73
4  42  97  96  92  49  68   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a bundle of items that is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. We have 5 agents and 7 items, so each agent cannot receive the same number of items, but we can try to allocate items to maximize total valuations and minimize envy.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each item across all agents to determine the most preferred items.
2. Use a round-robin or priority-based approach to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation items one at a time.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure each item is assigned and no agent is left out entirely unless it results in a better overall fairness.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 5 the highest, so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest, so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest, so assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 6 the highest, so assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest, so assign item 3 to Agent 4.
- Next, assign remaining items to balance allocations:
  - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation).
  - Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (next highest valuation).

The resulting allocation aims to balance the number of items while considering the agents' preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
