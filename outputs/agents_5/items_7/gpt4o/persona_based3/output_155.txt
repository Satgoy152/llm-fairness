Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  38  15  54  93  90  87
1  52  36   5  70  67   6  43
2  15  64  55  65  23  14  50
3  79  30  93  60   6  11  42
4  97  46   8  50  75  15  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We also aim to minimize envy among the agents as much as possible.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 4, 5, and 6. Allocating items 4 and 5 to this agent captures significant value.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 3 the most, so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has relatively high valuations for items 1 and 3, but 3 is already taken. Allocating item 6 to this agent is a good choice.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 the most, so allocate item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 0, so allocate item 0 to agent 4.

Now, let's ensure that all items are allocated, and no agent is left out unnecessarily:

- Item 1 is not yet allocated. It will be allocated to Agent 2, as they have a relatively high valuation for it compared to others who haven't received it.

This allocation results in:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 6, 1
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 0

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
