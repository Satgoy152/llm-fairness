Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  19  19   9  70  60  90
1  47  79  70  17  77  43   2
2  20  26  64  51  78  31  99
3  71  90  60  49  91  19  21
4  30  46  92  45  74  84   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible, ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. Given the constraints, an optimal allocation cannot always guarantee complete envy-freeness, but we can strive for it by considering each agent's preferences and maximizing their satisfaction.

Here are the valuations for reference:

- Agent 0: [96, 19, 19, 9, 70, 60, 90]
- Agent 1: [47, 79, 70, 17, 77, 43, 2]
- Agent 2: [20, 26, 64, 51, 78, 31, 99]
- Agent 3: [71, 90, 60, 49, 91, 19, 21]
- Agent 4: [30, 46, 92, 45, 74, 84, 9]

To begin the allocation, we will systematically allocate items based on the maximum value each agent assigns to them, ensuring each agent gets items they highly value, which can help mitigate envy.

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (96) and item 6 (90).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (79) and item 4 (77).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 6 (99), but since it's already taken by Agent 0, we'll consider item 4 (78).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 1 (90), but since it's already taken by Agent 1, we'll consider item 4 (91).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 2 (92).

Based on these valuations and to ensure that each item is allocated exactly once, here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [1]
- **Agent 2**: [5]
- **Agent 3**: [3]
- **Agent 4**: [2, 4]

This allocation gives each agent items that they value highly while ensuring that all items are allocated. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
