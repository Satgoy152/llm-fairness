Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  54  28  14  17  17  50
1  21   7  22  79  28  74  96
2  45  54  41  22  94  66  35
3  39   7  61  89  29  95  45
4  54  18  17  81  77  58  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, which means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the nature of the problem, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, but I will strive to minimize envy as much as possible while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and exactly seven items are distributed.

The approach involves first calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items and then attempting to balance the allocations such that the total value of the items each agent receives is as close as possible. 

Here is a proposed allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 278
   - Agent 1: 327
   - Agent 2: 357
   - Agent 3: 365
   - Agent 4: 396

2. To achieve a fair allocation, I will try to assign higher-value items to agents with lower total valuations to balance out the perceived value.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives item 0
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 4
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 5
- Agent 3 receives item 6
- Agent 4 receives item 2

This distribution attempts to balance the total perceived value each agent receives. Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all seven items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item.
