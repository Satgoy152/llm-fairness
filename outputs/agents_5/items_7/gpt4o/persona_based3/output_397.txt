Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  65  14   0  46   5  77
1  28  47  80  37  98  89  35
2  31   2  23  37  89  85  31
3   7  89  76  20  94  43  92
4  99  77   5  65   5  73  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations of each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own, given the constraints.

First, let's summarize the total valuation for each agent if they received all items:

- Agent 0: 210
- Agent 1: 414
- Agent 2: 298
- Agent 3: 421
- Agent 4: 388

Next, we aim to distribute the items such that the agents' valuations of their received items are as balanced as possible.

One approach to achieving this is to iteratively assign each item to the agent who values it most, while keeping track of the distribution to ensure no agent is over-allocated.

Hereâ€™s a proposed allocation based on the valuations:

1. Item 0 (most valued by Agent 4 with 99) is given to Agent 4.
2. Item 1 (most valued by Agent 3 with 89) is given to Agent 3.
3. Item 2 (most valued by Agent 1 with 80) is given to Agent 1.
4. Item 3 (most valued by Agent 1 with 37) is given to Agent 1.
5. Item 4 (most valued by Agent 1 with 98) is given to Agent 1.
6. Item 5 (most valued by Agent 2 with 85) is given to Agent 2.
7. Item 6 (most valued by Agent 3 with 92) is given to Agent 3.

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their assigned items, given their highest valuations.

Let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Agent 0, unfortunately, receives no items due to the distribution of valuations. However, this allocation aims to minimize envy, given the constraints.
