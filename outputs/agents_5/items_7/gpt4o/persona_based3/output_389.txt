Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  85  13  81  22  79  71
1  85   9  81  33  14  18   7
2  24  97  18  10  31  65  91
3   2  72  51  24  91  18  39
4  24  75   0  59  61  87  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the valuations matrix, we can use an approach that maximizes the sum of valuations for each agent's allocation. 

Let's analyze the problem step-by-step:

1. **List agent preferences**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 3, and 5.
   - Agent 1 prefers items 0, 2, and 3.
   - Agent 2 values items 1 and 6 the most.
   - Agent 3 prefers items 4 and 1.
   - Agent 4 has high valuations for items 5 and 6.

2. **Greedy allocation strategy**:
   - Start by assigning each agent their most valued item to reduce initial envy.
   - Proceed by considering remaining items, allocating them to the agent who values them the most, while keeping an eye on ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a proposed allocation based on this strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (value 84) because it is one of the highest values for agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 2 (value 81) because it's a high value for agent 1 and not highly valued by others.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 (value 97) because it's the highest value for agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 (value 91) because it's the highest value for agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 5 (value 87) because it's highly valued by agent 4.
- Remaining items are 3 and 6:
  - **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (value 81) because it's another high value for agent 0.
  - **Agent 4**: Assign item 6 (value 86), as it's the second-highest value for agent 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing their valuations. Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This distribution should minimize envy among the agents based on their preferences while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
