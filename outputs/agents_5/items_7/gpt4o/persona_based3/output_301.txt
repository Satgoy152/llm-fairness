Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  39  89  59  79  72  31
1  65  55  15  34  27  85  98
2  98  83  84  94  58  80  44
3  13  20  58  54  38   0  10
4   0  26  91  66  61  91   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, meaning that each agent should feel that they have received an allocation at least as valuable (according to their own valuation) as any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations, a straightforward approach is to use a form of the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that is still available. However, to achieve a more balanced allocation, we will consider each agent's total valuation of the items and try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as equal as possible.

Let's consider the total value of each agent's most-valued items:
- Agent 0: Highest values are 89, 79, 72.
- Agent 1: Highest values are 98, 85, 65.
- Agent 2: Highest values are 98, 94, 84.
- Agent 3: Highest values are 58, 54, 38.
- Agent 4: Highest values are 91, 91, 66.

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest single valuation (98 for item 0), so they should get item 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the second-highest valuation for an item (98 for item 6), so they should get item 6.
3. **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation (89 for item 2), so they should get item 2.
4. **Agent 4** has the next highest valuation (91 for item 5), so they should get item 5.
5. Now, considering remaining items:
   - **Agent 3** should receive item 3 (their highest remaining valued item).
6. Remaining items are 1 and 4:
   - **Agent 0** can take item 1 (since they already have a low-value item).
   - **Agent 4** can take item 4.

This allocation attempts to balance the values received by each agent as much as possible.

Here's the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent gets an integer number of items, and it respects the agents' valuations to minimize envy.
