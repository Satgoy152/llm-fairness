Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7   9  25  59  44  35  22
1   2  59  48   3  13  32  78
2   9  76  57  22  76  91  15
3   1  42  79  22  27  42  39
4  81  19  47  78  36  92  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness and try to minimize any potential envy. A simple approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin allocation method based on the preference rankings of each agent for each item. 

Let's proceed with the allocations:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by determining the highest valuation for each item across all agents.

2. **Round-Robin Allocation:** Sequentially allocate items to agents based on who values them the most, ensuring no agent receives more than necessary.

Let's go through the steps:

- **Item 0:** Highest valuation by Agent 4 (value 81).
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (value 76).
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation by Agent 3 (value 79).
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (value 59).
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (value 76).
- **Item 5:** Highest valuation by Agent 4 (value 92).
- **Item 6:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (value 78).

Now, assign these items to the respective agents:

- Agent 0: 3
- Agent 1: 6
- Agent 2: 1, 4
- Agent 3: 2
- Agent 4: 0, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, minimizing envy and ensuring a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```
