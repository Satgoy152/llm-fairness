Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  15  19  32  14  25  95
1  74  34  47   9  19  87  75
2  38   0  86  11  70  82  19
3  13  26  45  78  92  36  36
4  16  89  65  58  80   1  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free, as much as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations. Envy-freeness is a property where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, we will use a strategy to allocate items such that each agent has a fair share, minimizing envy. One approach is to use the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" method, which is a common technique in fair division problems:

1. We will start by determining the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Assign items to agents starting with the agent who values items the most and continue in a sequence until all items are assigned.

Let's calculate the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 40 + 15 + 19 + 32 + 14 + 25 + 95 = 240
- Agent 1: 74 + 34 + 47 + 9 + 19 + 87 + 75 = 345
- Agent 2: 38 + 0 + 86 + 11 + 70 + 82 + 19 = 306
- Agent 3: 13 + 26 + 45 + 78 + 92 + 36 + 36 = 326
- Agent 4: 16 + 89 + 65 + 58 + 80 + 1 + 51 = 360

We observe that Agent 4 has the highest total valuation, followed by Agent 1, Agent 3, Agent 2, and Agent 0.

Let's allocate the items using a sequential picking method:

1. Agent 4 picks the highest-valued item for them: Item 1 (value 89)
2. Agent 1 picks the highest-valued item for them: Item 0 (value 74)
3. Agent 3 picks the highest-valued item for them: Item 4 (value 92)
4. Agent 2 picks the highest-valued item for them: Item 2 (value 86)
5. Agent 0 picks the highest-valued item for them: Item 6 (value 95)
6. Now, we return to Agent 4 for their next highest: Item 3 (value 58)
7. Finally, Agent 1 takes the remaining item: Item 5 (value 87)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their highest-valued items based on a fair sequential picking approach, while ensuring all items are allocated and no agent receives more than 2 items.
