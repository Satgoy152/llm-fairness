Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  43  79  73  35  36  84
1  55  22  82  87  78  88  39
2  52  28  91  77  33  15  52
3  89  26  28  21   3  50  90
4  85  27  99  94   8   1  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we look to achieve an allocation that maximizes fairness, specifically focusing on minimizing envy among agents. One approach is to use an algorithm like the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) method, which aims to maximize the product of the utilities (values) each agent receives from their allocated items.

The given valuations for each agent and item are as follows:

```
Agent 0: [35, 43, 79, 73, 35, 36, 84]
Agent 1: [55, 22, 82, 87, 78, 88, 39]
Agent 2: [52, 28, 91, 77, 33, 15, 52]
Agent 3: [89, 26, 28, 21, 3, 50, 90]
Agent 4: [85, 27, 99, 94, 8, 1, 49]
```

Let's perform an allocation to maximize fairness using the described approach:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (Value: 87)
2. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (Value: 78)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (Value: 99)
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (Value: 90)
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (Value: 89)
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (Value: 43)
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (Value: 36)

The allocation is designed to maximize each agent's utility based on their highest available valuation while ensuring that every item is allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents, considering their individual valuations.
