Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  90  50   1  26   1  96
1  18  17  73  80  31  24   9
2  50  72  28   9  89  21  96
3  21  22  63  84  91   2  49
4   2  31  84  81  16  62  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Given the valuations, our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations. 

Let's examine the valuations:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 11 | 90 | 50 | 1  | 26 | 1  | 96 |
| 1          | 18 | 17 | 73 | 80 | 31 | 24 | 9  |
| 2          | 50 | 72 | 28 | 9  | 89 | 21 | 96 |
| 3          | 21 | 22 | 63 | 84 | 91 | 2  | 49 |
| 4          | 2  | 31 | 84 | 81 | 16 | 62 | 24 |

Next, we will try to assign items considering the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 6 (96). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 3 (80). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 6, but it's taken. Next highest is item 0 (50). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 4 (91). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is item 2 (84). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, the remaining unallocated items are 1 and 5.

6. **Remaining Item Allocation**:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (90).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 4, as they value it (62).

The allocations ensure all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation considers the preferences of the agents and tries to minimize envy by assigning the highest-valued available items to each agent.
