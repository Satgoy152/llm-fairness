Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99   1  26  29  97  75  69
1   0  26  62  70  60  16  81
2   2  99  13  22  95   4  94
3  80  65  15  42  30  49  91
4  41  69  77  51  54  82  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share. However, given the constraints of integer allocations and the potential complexity of achieving absolute envy-freeness, we can approximate this by attempting to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Let's examine the valuations and try to allocate items such that the perceived value each agent receives is balanced, keeping in mind that each agent must receive at least one item, and all 7 items need to be allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values item 0, so we assign item 0 to them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 highly, so we assign item 3 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 1, so we assign item 1 to them.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 6, so we assign item 6 to them.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values items 2 and 5 decently, so we assign items 2 and 5 to them.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and attempts to maximize the value for each agent based on their preferences. Here's how the allocation looks:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 5, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, all 7 items are distributed among the agents, and an attempt is made to provide each agent with items that have relatively high value for them.
