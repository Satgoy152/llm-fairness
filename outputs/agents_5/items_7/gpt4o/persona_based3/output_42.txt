Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  69  71  17  19  24  71  40
1  60  91  55  41   4  72  34
2  67  36   2  56  15  54  93
3  13   1  71  31  24  46  77
4  37  55  14  47  58  22  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we will use the concept of fair division, aiming to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among agents. Since each agent has different valuations for the items, we need to find a way to distribute the items such that each agent feels they receive a fair share based on their own valuations.

One approach is to use the "Envy-Free" algorithm, but given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, and every item must be allocated, we can adapt this approach to ensure no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuations.

Let's begin by examining the table and attempting to allocate items to maximize the overall fairness.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Identify High-Valuation Matches**: Start by allocating items to agents who value them the most.
2. **Balance the Allocation**: Ensure each agent gets a fair share of the total value based on their own valuations.

Let's look at each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than their fair share.

### Step-by-Step Allocation
- **Item 0**: Highest value is 69 by Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 91 by Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 71 by Agent 3.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 56 by Agent 2.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 58 by Agent 4.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 72 by Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 93 by Agent 2.

### Resulting Allocation
Based on the allocations above, we have:

- Agent 0: Item [0]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 3: Item [2]
- Agent 4: Item [4]

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most, leading to minimal envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation is fair under the given constraints and ensures that each agent receives at least one item with high valuation according to their preferences.
