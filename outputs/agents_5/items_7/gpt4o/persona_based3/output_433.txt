Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  28  36  74  75   7  29  59
1  90  16  82  11   6  78  59
2  75  42  32  75  54  87   7
3  13  29  81  75  51  91  23
4  40  65  93  63  59  65  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we should consider each agent's valuation of each item and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences. The goal is to minimize envy where possible and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if feasible.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items based on their valuation. Agent 0 values item 2 highest (74), item 3 second (75), and so on. Initially, allocate item 3 to Agent 0 as it has a high valuation (75).

2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 highest (90), so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highest (87), so allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 highest (91), but since it's already allocated, check the next highest. Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 (81).

5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 highest (93), but since it's already allocated, check the next highest. Allocate item 4 to Agent 4 (59).

With these allocations, we need to ensure that the remaining items are fairly distributed:

6. **Remaining Items (1 and 6)**: 
   - Agent 0 has received item 3.
   - Agent 1 has received item 0.
   - Agent 2 has received item 5.
   - Agent 3 has received item 2.
   - Agent 4 has received item 4.

Now, consider the unallocated items based on the remaining items:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 4 (65).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (59).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to be fair by considering the highest valuation items and distributing the remaining items to balance the number of items each agent receives. Each agent receives items based on their preferences, with attention to minimizing envy.
