Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  20  40  66  61  29  51
1  20  49  22  64  29   1  13
2  74  37  94  26  18   6  12
3  98  51  30  26  33  82  15
4  96  54  67  37  64  13  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while considering the valuations, one approach is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Given the valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives bundles of items that they value highly relative to others.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Analyze the valuations to identify items that are highly valued by each agent.
2. Try to allocate items in such a way that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation, minimizing any potential envy.

Here's one possible fair allocation based on the valuations:

- Agent 0 has a strong preference for items 0, 3, and 6.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 2 has a very high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 3 prefers item 5 most.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly.

Using these insights, let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6] (valuations: 49, 51)
- Agent 1: Item [1] (valuation: 49)
- Agent 2: Item [2] (valuation: 94)
- Agent 3: Item [5] (valuation: 82)
- Agent 4: Item [3, 4] (valuations: 37, 64)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and it attempts to balance the distribution to reduce envy. Now, presenting the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
