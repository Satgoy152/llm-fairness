Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  12  94  70  98  34  62
1  53  78  22  70   9  95  25
2  89   3  35  13  26  50  73
3  12  96  18  50  39   8   8
4  97  17  30  49  22  42  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 74     | 12     | 94     | 70     | 98     | 34     | 62     |
| 1     | 53     | 78     | 22     | 70     | 9      | 95     | 25     |
| 2     | 89     | 3      | 35     | 13     | 26     | 50     | 73     |
| 3     | 12     | 96     | 18     | 50     | 39     | 8      | 8      |
| 4     | 97     | 17     | 30     | 49     | 22     | 42     | 90     |

To ensure each agent gets at least one item, we look for high valuations and try to assign items that maximize fairness. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values Item 4 (98) and Item 2 (94). To balance, we allocate Item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values Item 5 the most (95). Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values Item 0 (89) significantly. Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values Item 1 (96) the most. Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values Item 6 (90) the most. Assign Item 6 to Agent 4.

Now we have assigned 5 items. The remaining two items (Items 2 and 3) need to be allocated:

6. **Item 2** has a high value for Agent 0 (94), but Agent 4 can also benefit from it (30). Assign Item 2 to Agent 4 to balance their total value.
7. **Item 3** is valued by Agents 0 and 1 at 70. Assign Item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 1 already has a highly valued item.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences.
