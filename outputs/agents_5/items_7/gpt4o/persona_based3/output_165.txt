Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  48  33  83  18  43  22
1  52  57  87  27  32  41  76
2  85  38  23  70  23  30  14
3  85  15  33  73  86  46  66
4  58  88  99  21  98   0  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. We want to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations of the items. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Maximum Valuation for Each Item:**  
   Determine which agent values each item the most. This can help ensure that the item is allocated to someone who sees high value in it.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Valuation:**  
   Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Adjustments for Fairness:**  
   After the initial allocation, some agents may end up with more items or higher overall value than others. Adjust the allocations to ensure fairness.

Let's perform the allocation:

### Step 1: Determine Maximum Valuations
- Item 0 is most valued by agent 2 and 3 (both value it at 85).
- Item 1 is most valued by agent 4 (value of 88).
- Item 2 is most valued by agent 4 (value of 99).
- Item 3 is most valued by agent 0 (value of 83).
- Item 4 is most valued by agent 4 (value of 98).
- Item 5 is most valued by agent 3 (value of 46).
- Item 6 is most valued by agent 1 (value of 76).

### Step 2: Initial Allocation
- Allocate Item 0 to agent 2 (or agent 3).
- Allocate Item 1 to agent 4.
- Allocate Item 2 to agent 4.
- Allocate Item 3 to agent 0.
- Allocate Item 4 to agent 4.
- Allocate Item 5 to agent 3.
- Allocate Item 6 to agent 1.

### Step 3: Adjustments for Fairness
- Agent 4 is receiving too many items (3 items), and redistribution is needed for fairness.
- We can exchange items to ensure more even distribution.

### Final Allocation
- Allocate Item 0 to agent 2.
- Allocate Item 1 to agent 4.
- Allocate Item 2 to agent 4.
- Allocate Item 3 to agent 0.
- Allocate Item 4 to agent 3.
- Allocate Item 5 to agent 3.
- Allocate Item 6 to agent 1.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is as envy-free as possible based on the valuations.
