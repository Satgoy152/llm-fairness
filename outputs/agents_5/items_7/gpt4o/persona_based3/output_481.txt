Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  10  79  86  19  86  90
1  17  20   5  23  43  38  74
2  26   5  75  21  60  28  76
3  55   3  80  25  65  35  11
4   1  45  24  53  97  55  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. In this scenario, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

One approach to achieve a fair division is to use the max-min fairness principle, which tries to maximize the minimum value any agent receives, ensuring the allocation is as equitable as possible.

Let's consider the valuations and attempt a fair allocation:

1. Start by allocating the highest-valued items first to prevent envy.
2. Ensure each agent receives a roughly equal share based on their valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 6, 5, and 3. Allocate item 6 and 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 4, allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2, allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 2, but since it's already taken, allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 highly values item 4, but since it's already taken, allocate item 0 and 1 to Agent 4.

Let's verify this allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [6, 5] with values [90, 86], totaling 176.
- Agent 1 receives item [4] with value [43].
- Agent 2 receives item [2] with value [75].
- Agent 3 receives item [3] with value [25].
- Agent 4 receives items [0, 1] with values [1, 45], totaling 46.

Each agent has received a fair share based on the initial valuations, and the allocation ensures envy-freeness as much as possible given the constraints.

Given this, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
