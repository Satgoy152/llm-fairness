Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  29   7  50   0  65  33  96
1  27  87   6  43  73  83  65
2  83  85  10  30   5  94  99
3  25  43  16  84   3  38  88
4  95  84  17  91  56  94  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to analyze the valuations table and distribute the items such that no agent envies another for their allocation.

Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 6 the most (96), so we will allocate item 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 1 the most (87), so we will allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 the most (94), so we will allocate item 5 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 the most (84), so we will allocate item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 0 the most (95), so we will allocate item 0 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 out of 7 items. We need to allocate the remaining items (2 and 4) while considering the remaining value preferences:

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 50
  - Agent 1: 6
  - Agent 2: 10
  - Agent 3: 16
  - Agent 4: 17

Agent 0 values item 2 the highest, so we will allocate item 2 to agent 0.

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0: 65
  - Agent 1: 73
  - Agent 2: 5
  - Agent 3: 3
  - Agent 4: 56

Agent 1 values item 4 the highest, so we will allocate item 4 to agent 1.

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives one or more items based on their highest valuations, promoting fairness and minimizing envy among agents.
