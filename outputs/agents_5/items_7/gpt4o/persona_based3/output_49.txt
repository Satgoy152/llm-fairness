Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  30   7  41  66   8  40
1  36  20  57  91  99  68  58
2  14  73  40  60  18   9  35
3  88  94   1  85   8  96   4
4  29  58  46  23  73  41  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations, while maintaining the constraint that every item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent can receive an integer number of items. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. While complete envy-freeness can be challenging to achieve with indivisible goods, we can aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy based on maximizing the total satisfaction of the agents:

1. **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest at 94 and item 5 at 96, which are quite significant compared to others' valuations. Assign items 1 and 5 to Agent 3.

2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest at 99 and item 3 at 91. Assign items 4 and 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 0** has a relatively high value for item 6 at 40 compared to other agents. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

4. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 2 at 40 compared to others. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

5. **Agent 4** is left with item 0, which they value at 29, and it's the remaining item.

With this allocation, each item is assigned, and agents receive at least one item based on their highest valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance assignments based on valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
