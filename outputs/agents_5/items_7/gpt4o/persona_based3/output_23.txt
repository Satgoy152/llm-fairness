Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  41  12  11  94  70  90
1  60  32  62  28  41  89  98
2  70   8   8  11  66  50  61
3   8  17  33  12  83  29  28
4   9   7  71  60  38  51  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that aims to minimize envy among agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent. This means we should try to allocate items to agents such that each agent's total valuation is as high as possible, while also ensuring a fair distribution of items. In this scenario, we have 5 agents and 7 items to allocate.

Let's summarize the values each agent assigns to each item:

- **Agent 0**: [16, 41, 12, 11, 94, 70, 90]
- **Agent 1**: [60, 32, 62, 28, 41, 89, 98]
- **Agent 2**: [70, 8, 8, 11, 66, 50, 61]
- **Agent 3**: [8, 17, 33, 12, 83, 29, 28]
- **Agent 4**: [9, 7, 71, 60, 38, 51, 91]

To allocate the items, we can use a priority-based approach where each agent is assigned the item they value most, while ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the most (94).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the most (98).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most (70).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 the most (83), but it's already taken. Next best is item 2 (33).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 the most (91), but it's already taken. Next best is item 5 (51).

Continue assigning the remaining items to the agents:

- Item 1 is valued next highest by Agent 0 (41).
- Item 3 is valued next highest by Agent 4 (60).

Now, let's verify that each agent has a fair share and the total allocation is correct:

- **Agent 0**: Items [4, 1] (valuations: 94, 41)
- **Agent 1**: Item [6] (valuation: 98)
- **Agent 2**: Item [0] (valuation: 70)
- **Agent 3**: Item [2] (valuation: 33)
- **Agent 4**: Items [5, 3] (valuations: 51, 60)

This allocation uses all 7 items, and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 3]
}
```
