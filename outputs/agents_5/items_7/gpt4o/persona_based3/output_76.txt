Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  58  70  20   2  24  84
1  88  83   1  92  21  15   8
2  12  87  66  90  54  97  38
3  36  49  88  50   7  35  41
4  43  12  63  33  67  41   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair and envy-free manner, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction relative to their valuations. One approach is to use a round-robin allocation process based on the agents' preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Determine the order in which agents will pick items based on their total valuations to try and maximize fairness.
3. Allocate items one by one to agents in the determined order, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 58 + 58 + 70 + 20 + 2 + 24 + 84 = 316
   - Agent 1: 88 + 83 + 1 + 92 + 21 + 15 + 8 = 308
   - Agent 2: 12 + 87 + 66 + 90 + 54 + 97 + 38 = 444
   - Agent 3: 36 + 49 + 88 + 50 + 7 + 35 + 41 = 306
   - Agent 4: 43 + 12 + 63 + 33 + 67 + 41 + 8 = 267

2. Order the agents based on their total valuations (descending): Agent 2, Agent 0, Agent 1, Agent 3, Agent 4.

3. Allocate items in a round-robin manner based on agents' preferences:
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 97)
   - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 84)
   - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 92)
   - Agent 3 picks item 2 (value 88)
   - Agent 4 picks item 4 (value 67)
   - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 87)
   - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 58)

Each agent picks the most valuable item available to them in turn.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the process is as fair as possible given the valuations and constraints.
