Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  55  35  30  82   5  34
1  12  80  17  73  65  82  52
2   5  49  44  87  11   4  78
3  84  37  67  84   5   3  76
4  86  97  62  64  86  83  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a strategy that tries to balance the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.

First, letâ€™s calculate the total valuation each agent has across all items:

- Agent 0: \(1 + 55 + 35 + 30 + 82 + 5 + 34 = 242\)
- Agent 1: \(12 + 80 + 17 + 73 + 65 + 82 + 52 = 381\)
- Agent 2: \(5 + 49 + 44 + 87 + 11 + 4 + 78 = 278\)
- Agent 3: \(84 + 37 + 67 + 84 + 5 + 3 + 76 = 356\)
- Agent 4: \(86 + 97 + 62 + 64 + 86 + 83 + 94 = 572\)

Now, we will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent's total valuation from the items they receive is as balanced as possible. We should try to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 5]
  - Total valuation: \(1 + 5 = 6\)

- **Agent 1**: Item [1]
  - Total valuation: \(80\)

- **Agent 2**: Item [3]
  - Total valuation: \(87\)

- **Agent 3**: Items [2, 6]
  - Total valuation: \(67 + 76 = 143\)

- **Agent 4**: Item [4]
  - Total valuation: \(86\)

This allocation attempts to maximize the individual agent's total valuations based on their preferences, while also ensuring all items are allocated. Note that the actual sum of valuations may vary, and it's difficult to ensure absolute envy-freeness with integer allocations, but this allocation respects the given constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
