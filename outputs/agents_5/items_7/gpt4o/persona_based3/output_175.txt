Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  63  98  18  65  11  55
1  70  63   7  57  60  79  52
2  64   6   8  92  60  67  11
3  90   2  20   2  56  30  21
4  53   5  35  28  45  36  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair, ideally striving for envy-freeness. However, complete envy-freeness might not always be possible, especially with integer allocations and differing valuations. 

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to get an idea of their preferences:

- Agent 0: 48 + 63 + 98 + 18 + 65 + 11 + 55 = 358
- Agent 1: 70 + 63 + 7 + 57 + 60 + 79 + 52 = 388
- Agent 2: 64 + 6 + 8 + 92 + 60 + 67 + 11 = 308
- Agent 3: 90 + 2 + 20 + 2 + 56 + 30 + 21 = 221
- Agent 4: 53 + 5 + 35 + 28 + 45 + 36 + 71 = 273

Now, let's try to allocate items to minimize envy and maximize perceived fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 2, so assigning item 2 to them is beneficial. Also, item 0 has a high value for them.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 5, followed by item 0. Assigning item 5 to them is a good choice.
3. **Agent 2**: They highly value item 3, which is distinct from other agents' preferences. Assign item 3 to them.
4. **Agent 3**: They highly value item 0, but since it's already allocated, let's consider item 4, which they value moderately.
5. **Agent 4**: They have a relatively high valuation for item 6 compared to others. Assign item 6 to them.

Adjusting to ensure all items are allocated:
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as they value it second most after item 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as they have a relatively high valuation for it as well.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [2, 1]
- Agent 1: [5, 4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [6]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6]
}
```
