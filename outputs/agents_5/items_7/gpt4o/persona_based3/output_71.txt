Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  15  22  99  54  91  69
1  61  75  21  40   7  49  45
2  65  48  34  33  29   9  53
3  50  63  94  58  18  68  42
4  84  91  64  91  20   5   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness (where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own), we can use a method that takes into account each agent's valuations. One common approach is to use a method that tries to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.

Let's calculate the total value each agent would receive under different allocations and aim to balance these values as closely as possible.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [51, 15, 22, 99, 54, 91, 69]
Agent 1: [61, 75, 21, 40, 7, 49, 45]
Agent 2: [65, 48, 34, 33, 29, 9, 53]
Agent 3: [50, 63, 94, 58, 18, 68, 42]
Agent 4: [84, 91, 64, 91, 20, 5, 0]
```

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: They highly value item 3 (99) and item 5 (91). Assign these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: They highly value item 1 (75). Assign this to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: They can be assigned item 0 (65) which has a high value for them.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 (94) has a high value for Agent 3, so assign it to them.
5. **Agent 4**: Items 4 (20) and 6 (0) can be assigned to Agent 4, as they have relatively lower values for others and can help balance out the total value.

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 gets items: [3, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items: [1]
- Agent 2 gets items: [0]
- Agent 3 gets items: [2]
- Agent 4 gets items: [4, 6]

This allocation should help in minimizing envy, although perfect envy-freeness is often not achievable with indivisible items.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
