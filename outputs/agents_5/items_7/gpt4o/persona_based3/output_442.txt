Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  99  69  83  84  58  13  93
1  19  77  77  75  45  30  55
2  62  65  77  49  37  73  61
3   4  58  83  18  67  18  13
4  23  31  45  15  75  50  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible, where each agent values their allocation the most relative to what they could have received. 

One approach to achieve this is to use the "maximum product" method, which attempts to maximize the product of utilities (valuations) each agent gets from their allocated items. Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. **Rank the Items by Valuation for Each Agent:** We'll create a preference list for each agent based on how much they value each item.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Start by attempting to allocate each agent their most preferred item that has not yet been allocated to any other agent.

3. **Adjust for Envy:** If there are any items left or if some agents have no items, adjust the allocation to minimize envy. This can involve reassigning items to different agents if it increases the overall satisfaction of the group.

4. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:** Make sure all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's walk through an allocation:

- **Agent 0's Preferences:** [0, 6, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5]
- **Agent 1's Preferences:** [1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 5, 0]
- **Agent 2's Preferences:** [2, 5, 1, 6, 0, 3, 4]
- **Agent 3's Preferences:** [2, 4, 1, 0, 3, 5, 6]
- **Agent 4's Preferences:** [4, 5, 2, 1, 0, 6, 3]

Initial allocation based on top preferences:
- Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 99)
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 77)
- Agent 2 gets item 2 (value 77)
- Agent 3 gets item 4 (value 67)
- Agent 4 gets item 5 (value 50)

The remaining items are 3 and 6. We can allocate these to agents who would benefit the most:

- Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 93)
- Agent 1 gets item 3 (value 75)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is relatively fair based on their preferences, minimizing envy.

Here is the resulting allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```
