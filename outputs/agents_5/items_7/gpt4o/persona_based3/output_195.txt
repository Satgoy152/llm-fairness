Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  18  51  84  79  52  41
1  63  29  47  55  82   5  88
2  22  78  79   0  39  79  84
3  85  84  58   6  64   7  31
4   8  68  41  59  16  91  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here are the steps we'll follow to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the most valued item for each agent**: This helps in understanding the preferences of each agent.
2. **Use a greedy method to allocate items**: Start by allocating the most valued items to each agent, ensuring that each item is allocated only once. If an item is desired by multiple agents, prioritize based on overall distribution fairness.
3. **Iterate to ensure all items are allocated**: Once each agent has their most valued item, if possible, continue to allocate remaining items by considering the next highest value for each agent.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- **Agent 0** values item 3 (84) the highest.
- **Agent 1** values item 6 (88) the highest.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 (79) and item 6 (84) the highest, but since item 6 is already taken by Agent 1, we allocate item 2 (79) to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 0 (85) the highest.
- **Agent 4** values item 5 (91) the highest.

Now, we have allocated items 3, 6, 2, 0, and 5, leaving items 1 and 4 still to allocate.

- Item 1 (valued at 78) is highly valued by Agent 2, but since Agent 2 already has item 2, we need to ensure fairness. Therefore, we allocate item 1 to Agent 4, who values it at 68.
- Item 4 (valued at 82) is highly valued by Agent 1, and it is available, so it should be allocated to Agent 1.

Now, every agent has at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints and preferences of each agent. Each agent receives a valuable item according to their preferences, and all items are distributed.
