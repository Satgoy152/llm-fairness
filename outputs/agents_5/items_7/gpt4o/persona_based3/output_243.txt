Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  65  92  29  24  47  81
1   1  61  47  74  63  78  33
2   1   9  22  86  40  12  87
3   6   0  27  79  55  10   3
4  62  65  46  58  28  94  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation with envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction relative to their valuations while keeping the distribution as balanced as possible. Given the preferences of each agent for the items, we can use an iterative process to allocate items based on highest value preferences and ensure no envy.

Let's proceed with a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (92).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (78).
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the most (87).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (79).
   - Agent 4 values item 5 the most (94).

2. **Initial Assignment:**
   - Start by assigning each agent one of their highest valued items. If any conflicts arise (i.e., two agents want the same item), assign based on the highest unique value.

3. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - Item 5 is most valued by Agent 4 (94) and also highly valued by Agent 1 (78). Assign item 5 to Agent 4.
   - Item 2 is most valued by Agent 0 (92).
   - Item 6 is most valued by Agent 2 (87).
   - Item 3 is most valued by Agent 3 (79).

4. **Assign Remaining Items:**
   - We still need to allocate items 0, 1, and 4. 

5. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Item 1 (valued at 65) can go to Agent 0 as it is their second-highest valued item.
   - Item 4 (valued at 63) can go to Agent 1 as it is their next highest valued item.
   - Item 0 (valued at 62) can go to Agent 4 as it is their next highest valued item.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation reflects agents' preferences with minimal envy.
