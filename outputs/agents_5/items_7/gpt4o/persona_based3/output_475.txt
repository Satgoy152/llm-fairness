Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  99   1  38  47  19  54
1  32  99  37  83  84   3  85
2  72  45  60  82  33  90  51
3   4  61  32  89   9  60  39
4  61  59  86  82  61  81  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, one common criterion is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own given their valuations. While perfect envy-freeness might not always be possible, especially with indivisible items and different valuations, we can still strive to minimize envy as much as possible.

Letâ€™s evaluate a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 highly (99), so we assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuates item 0 (32), item 2 (37), and item 6 (85) moderately, but item 3 (83) and item 4 (84) highly. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highly (90). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly (89) but it's already assigned. Values item 5 highly (60) but it's also assigned. Assign item 6 (39) to Agent 3, which is one of the remaining items with decent value for them.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 highly (86). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we have assigned 5 items. The remaining two items (0 and 4) need to be allocated:

- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 0, as they also value it (86).
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 1, as they have a high valuation (84) for it.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 2

This distribution seeks to balance the allocations based on each agent's preferences, with a focus on minimizing envy. Each agent receives at least one item, and the total items allocated are 7.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```
