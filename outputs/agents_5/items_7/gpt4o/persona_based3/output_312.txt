Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  22  55  26  81   3  15
1  61  82  96   9  85  70  26
2  64  53  45  90  48  37  87
3  71  34   5  37  61  69  97
4  94  36  79  46  38  93  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the "maximum Nash welfare" approach, which tries to maximize the product of utilities received by each agent. This approach often leads to allocations that are both efficient and fair.

Given the valuations, we will attempt to allocate items to maximize fairness based on the agents' preferences:

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Prefers item 4 (value: 81) the most.
   - Give item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Prefers item 2 (value: 96) the most.
   - Give item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Prefers item 3 (value: 90) the most.
   - Give item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Prefers item 6 (value: 97) the most.
   - Give item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Prefers item 0 (value: 94) the most.
   - Give item 0 to Agent 4.

With these initial allocations, we have 2 items left: items 1 and 5.

6. **Remaining Items:**
   - For item 1:
     - Agent 1 values it the most (value: 82).
     - Give item 1 to Agent 1.

   - For item 5:
     - Agent 4 values it the most (value: 93).
     - Give item 5 to Agent 4.

This allocation respects the preferences of agents as much as possible while ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their strongest preferences.

**Final Allocations:**
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```
