Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  86  17  29  62  63   9
1   8  37  76  28   3  46  78
2  67  61  24  18  94  45  82
3  61  25  44  12  34  31  83
4   8  72  59   4  41  33  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items amongst the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation of items over their own.

Given the valuation matrix, an approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a round-robin method, which involves iteratively assigning items to agents based on their highest preference for the remaining unallocated items.

Here's how the allocation can be approached:

1. **Agent 0**: Start by allocating the item that Agent 0 values the most and is still available. Agent 0 values item 0 the most, with a valuation of 91.

2. **Agent 1**: Next, allocate the item that Agent 1 values the most and is still available. Agent 1 values item 2 the most, with a valuation of 76.

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate the item that Agent 2 values the most and is still available. Agent 2 values item 4 the most, with a valuation of 94.

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate the item that Agent 3 values the most and is still available. Agent 3 values item 6 the most, with a valuation of 83.

5. **Agent 4**: Allocate the item that Agent 4 values the most and is still available. Agent 4 values item 1 the most, with a valuation of 72.

Now, each agent has one item, and there are two items left (3 and 5).

6. **Agent 0**: Allocate the next most valued item still available for Agent 0. Between items 3 and 5, Agent 0 values item 5 more, with a valuation of 63.

7. **Agent 1**: Allocate the last remaining item to Agent 1. The only remaining item is 3.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 7.
