Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  17  92  83  46  41  30  13
1  77  22  96  13  79  82  14
2  28  94  19  11  18  53  15
3  21  81  97  30  40  25  23
4  34   1  14  49  26  62   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where possible, ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as highly as they would value any other agent's allocation.

Let's start by evaluating the highest value each agent places on the items and attempt to allocate accordingly to minimize envy.

### Agent 0:
- Highest valuations: Item 1 (92), Item 2 (83), Item 3 (46)

### Agent 1:
- Highest valuations: Item 2 (96), Item 5 (82), Item 4 (79)

### Agent 2:
- Highest valuations: Item 1 (94), Item 5 (53), Item 0 (28)

### Agent 3:
- Highest valuations: Item 2 (97), Item 1 (81), Item 4 (40)

### Agent 4:
- Highest valuations: Item 5 (62), Item 3 (49), Item 0 (34)

We will allocate items by giving each agent one of their highest-valued items, ensuring the allocations are fair:

1. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3 (97 is the highest single valuation for any item).
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (94 is highest after item 2 has been allocated).
3. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 4 (62 is the highest remaining).
4. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (79 is the highest remaining).
5. Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (17 is the highest remaining for Agent 0).
6. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 4 (49 is high, and Agent 4 does not have more than 1 item yet).
7. Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0 (13 is the highest remaining for Agent 0 who has less items).

Agent 0 receives two items, while other agents receive one item each, ensuring that all items are allocated and attempting to maintain an envy-free scenario.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 3]
}
```
