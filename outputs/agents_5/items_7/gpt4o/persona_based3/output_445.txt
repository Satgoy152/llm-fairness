Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  26  24  29  10   4  36
1  26   7  21  83  28  34   2
2  95  78  61  77  88   8  24
3  59  18  58  97  71   9  91
4  96  25  85  68  45  77  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items, aiming for an envy-free distribution where possible. The goal is to allocate all 7 items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations and try to assign items to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items with higher valuations. Since agent 0 values item 6 the most (36), let's assign item 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 3 (83). Let's assign item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 0 (95). Assign item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Valuates item 3 highly, but it's already taken. The next highest valuation is item 6 (91), which is also taken. The next available highest is item 4 (71). Assign item 4 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 0, but it's taken. Next highest is item 2 (85). Assign item 2 to agent 4.

Now, all agents have at least one item. We need to allocate the remaining items 1, 5:

- For item 1: 
  - Agent 2 values item 1 at 78, which is the highest remaining valuation. 

- For item 5: 
  - Agent 4 values item 5 at 77, which is the highest remaining valuation.

Based on this allocation strategy, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the highest preferences of each agent given the constraints and ensures that all items are allocated.
