Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  24  24  23  82  43  48
1  10  51  91  75  24   9  53
2  72  35  11  32  45  58  89
3   3  15  94  72  21  12  29
4  62   5   8  98   4  95  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we're aiming for a fair division of the items among the agents, which often involves ensuring envy-freeness or maximizing the total value for each agent while minimizing envy among them. Given the valuations, a possible approach is the "maximum envy-free" allocation, but since achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible goods is often impossible, we might aim for a "minimally envious" allocation instead.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (82).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (91).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (89).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (94), but it's highly valued by Agent 1 as well.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most (98).

A good approach is to start by allocating each agent their highest-valued item, if possible, and then distribute the remaining items based on maximizing the sum of valuations for the remaining agents.

Allocating highest-valued items:
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Remaining items: 0, 1, 5

Now, distribute the remaining items to minimize envy:
- Agent 3 has not yet received any items, so we should consider giving at least one item to Agent 3.
- Agent 3 values item 1 next highest, so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
- Agent 0 values item 0 next highest, allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- The last item, item 5, can be allocated to Agent 4, who also values it significantly.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Items 3, 5

This allocation attempts to balance the desires of each agent based on their valuations, giving everyone at least one item and trying to maximize total satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```
