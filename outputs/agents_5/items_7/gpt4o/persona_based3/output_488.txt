Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  13  70  24  73  42  76
1  65   8  66  36  43  73  67
2  33  75  90  63  96  50  97
3  73  85  39  82  36  22  19
4  88  11   9  53  80  60  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent values their bundle at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle, to the extent possible given the constraints.

Let's evaluate the total value each agent gives to all items:

- Agent 0: 96 + 13 + 70 + 24 + 73 + 42 + 76 = 394
- Agent 1: 65 + 8 + 66 + 36 + 43 + 73 + 67 = 358
- Agent 2: 33 + 75 + 90 + 63 + 96 + 50 + 97 = 504
- Agent 3: 73 + 85 + 39 + 82 + 36 + 22 + 19 = 356
- Agent 4: 88 + 11 + 9 + 53 + 80 + 60 + 52 = 353

Now, let's allocate items to agents in a way that considers their valuations and attempts to balance the distribution:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest total valuation and highly values items 4 and 6. Assign these to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 2. Assign these to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** can take item 3, as it is the remaining item and agent 4 values it reasonably.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, given the constraints. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation respects the valuation preferences of each agent as much as possible, given the limited number of items and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
