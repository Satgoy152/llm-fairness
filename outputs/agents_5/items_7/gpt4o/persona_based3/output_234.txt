Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  35  25   6   8  44  12
1  26  71   1  26  64  55  10
2  64  84  19   7  90   8  91
3  59  80  64  57  50  96  80
4  35  86  70  94  95  89  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, I will use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (since there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will get more than one item). We will aim to have a fair distribution to minimize envy among agents.

Let's start by reviewing the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [76, 35, 25, 6, 8, 44, 12]
Agent 1: [26, 71, 1, 26, 64, 55, 10]
Agent 2: [64, 84, 19, 7, 90, 8, 91]
Agent 3: [59, 80, 64, 57, 50, 96, 80]
Agent 4: [35, 86, 70, 94, 95, 89, 15]
```

We will allocate items to agents such that the total value of items is maximized for each agent without creating significant envy. The allocations should be balanced across agents:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (76), so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (71), so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 6 (91), so we assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 5 (96), so we assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 4 (95), so we assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have assigned 5 out of 7 items. We need to assign the remaining 2 items:

6. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 4 (70), and item 3 is valued highest by Agent 4 (94). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now all items are allocated, and we ensure a fair division:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
