Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86  47  84  65  72  93   6
1  49  84  12  25  39  50  63
2  54  94  94  44  59   4   6
3   5  26  68  89  44  36  10
4  55  83  76  38  41  85  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items so that no agent envies another's allocation. Given the valuations, let's try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their declared valuations.

### Steps for Fair Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 highly (93).
   - Agent 1 values item 1 highly (84).
   - Agent 2 values items 1 and 2 highly (94, 94).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 highly (89).
   - Agent 4 values item 5 highly (85).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (highest value for this item).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for this item).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (highest value joint with item 1 for this agent).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (highest value for this item).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4 (next highest value item for Agent 4).

3. **Resolve Remaining Items:**
   - Items 0 and 4 are unallocated.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value for this agent).

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring that all items are allocated. 

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6]
}
```
