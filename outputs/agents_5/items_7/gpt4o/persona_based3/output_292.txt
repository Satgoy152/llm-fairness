Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  24  67  79   1   7  98
1  80  87  16   1  15  36  70
2  99  38  67  45  36  13  87
3  74  78  73  44  25   3  36
4  43  98  76  84  46  54   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a heuristic approach. One such approach is maximizing each agent's total perceived value of the items they receive, taking into account the preferences of all agents.

Given the valuations, we can proceed with the allocation as follows:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 6. Allocating item 6 to Agent 0 maximizes their value significantly.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most, so we'll allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 0, which is now unallocated, so we'll allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly, and it is still available, so we'll give item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest value for item 4, so we'll allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2 and 5):

- **Agent 0** has a relatively high valuation for item 2, so we'll allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- The final item, item 5, will be allocated to **Agent 1**, as it has a moderately high valuation for this item compared to others.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
