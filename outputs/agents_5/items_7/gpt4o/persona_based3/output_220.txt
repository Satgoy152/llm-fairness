Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  45  84  35  58  10  13  11
1  55  51  83  57  34  85  15
2  22  81  38  42  48  58  35
3   4  62  75  16  17  30  66
4  50  23   1  61  30  74  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and distributes the items as equitably as possible. Let's examine the valuations and try to achieve an envy-free or equitable allocation. 

First, let's calculate the total valuations for each agent over all items:

- Agent 0: 45 + 84 + 35 + 58 + 10 + 13 + 11 = 256
- Agent 1: 55 + 51 + 83 + 57 + 34 + 85 + 15 = 380
- Agent 2: 22 + 81 + 38 + 42 + 48 + 58 + 35 = 324
- Agent 3: 4 + 62 + 75 + 16 + 17 + 30 + 66 = 270
- Agent 4: 50 + 23 + 1 + 61 + 30 + 74 + 76 = 315

Next, we aim to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations to minimize envy.

Here's a possible allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 1 (value 84)
- Agent 1 gets items 5 (value 85)
- Agent 2 gets items 6 (value 35)
- Agent 3 gets items 2 (value 75)
- Agent 4 gets items 0, 3, 4 (values 50, 61, 30)

This allocation is chosen to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences, while ensuring that all items are allocated and trying to maintain balance in the number of items each agent receives.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
