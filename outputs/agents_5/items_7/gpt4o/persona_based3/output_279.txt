Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21   2  46  93  50  70  65
1  97  86  16  79  99  96  89
2  23  24  17  54  80  57  88
3  49  99  48  26  51  91  29
4  66  89  26  31  35  85  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, aiming for an envy-free allocation, we can consider each agent's valuation and attempt to maximize overall fairness. One common approach is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking the most valuable item available to them according to their own valuation. However, exact envy-free allocations can be complex and may not always exist, especially in small discrete settings like this.

Given the valuation table, let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Agent 1 values item 4 the most with a valuation of 99. Assign item 4 to agent 1.
2. Agent 3 values item 1 the most with a valuation of 99. Assign item 1 to agent 3.
3. Agent 0 values item 3 the most with a valuation of 93. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
4. Agent 1's next highest preference is item 5 with a valuation of 96. Assign item 5 to agent 1.
5. Agent 2 values item 6 the most with a valuation of 88. Assign item 6 to agent 2.
6. Agent 0's next highest preference is item 2 with a valuation of 46. Assign item 2 to agent 0.
7. Agent 4's highest remaining preference is item 0 with a valuation of 66. Assign item 0 to agent 4.

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on the agents' highest preferences. The final allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```
