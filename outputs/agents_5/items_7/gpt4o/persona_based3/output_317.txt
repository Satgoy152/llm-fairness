Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42   1  91  52  37  28  69
1  35  66  29  80  25  30  71
2  31  93  97  14  62  42  48
3  62   7  76  61  16  90  44
4  54  52  48   7  45  47  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use an algorithmic approach such as the Envy-Free Matching or similar heuristic that attempts to minimize envy among agents. Given the constraints and the preferences of the agents, we will try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(42 + 1 + 91 + 52 + 37 + 28 + 69 = 320\)
- Agent 1: \(35 + 66 + 29 + 80 + 25 + 30 + 71 = 336\)
- Agent 2: \(31 + 93 + 97 + 14 + 62 + 42 + 48 = 387\)
- Agent 3: \(62 + 7 + 76 + 61 + 16 + 90 + 44 = 356\)
- Agent 4: \(54 + 52 + 48 + 7 + 45 + 47 + 96 = 349\)

One way to allocate the items is to ensure each agent gets one of their higher-valued items if possible. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 2 (value 91)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 80)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 93)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 5 (value 90)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 6 (value 96)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining two items (0 and 4) in a way that minimizes envy:

- **Agent 0** can receive Item 0 (value 42)
- **Agent 2** can receive Item 4 (value 62)

This allocation aims to balance the values each agent receives relative to their preferences.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items in accordance with their preferences, while minimizing potential envy.
