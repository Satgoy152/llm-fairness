Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  56  52  52  61  16   3  61
1  28  40  33  77  13  35  92
2   1  79  95   5  22  32  37
3   9  35  41  57  13  20  58
4  15  89  29  86   3  38  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, which means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, given their own valuations.

One commonly used method for achieving a fair division is the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method. This method involves having agents take turns choosing items in a sequence based on their preferences. However, in this case, we might try an approach that ensures each agent receives at least one item, and we focus on minimizing envy by considering each agent’s top-valued items.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 3 and 6 (both 61). We can assign one of them. Let's choose item 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (92). We assign item 6.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (95). We assign item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (58), which is already taken. Next highest is 3 (57), which is also taken. The next highest is item 2 (41), which is taken. Then item 6 (58), which is already taken. Next highest is item 3 (57), which is also taken. So, we assign item 5 (20).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (89). We assign item 1.

Now, we have assigned items 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6. Still left are items 0 and 4.

Continuing:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest available is item 0 (56). We assign item 0.
- **Agent 3**: The only remaining item is 4. We assign item 4 to Agent 3 as they have a slightly higher preference for it than Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an item, and we have distributed all items. Each agent has at least one of their higher-valued items, minimizing envy.

Here’s the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
