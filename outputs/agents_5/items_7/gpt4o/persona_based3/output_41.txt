Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  50  57  66  36  81  68
1  36  93  39  44   6  36  56
2  83  10  40  17  82  74  75
3  11  55  92  14  38  12  26
4  93  71  58  46   3  14  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible. Hereâ€™s the process to achieve that:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum up the values each agent assigns to all items.
   - Agent 0: \(43 + 50 + 57 + 66 + 36 + 81 + 68 = 401\)
   - Agent 1: \(36 + 93 + 39 + 44 + 6 + 36 + 56 = 310\)
   - Agent 2: \(83 + 10 + 40 + 17 + 82 + 74 + 75 = 381\)
   - Agent 3: \(11 + 55 + 92 + 14 + 38 + 12 + 26 = 248\)
   - Agent 4: \(93 + 71 + 58 + 46 + 3 + 14 + 80 = 365\)

2. **Calculate Average Valuation Per Item**: Divide each agent's total valuation by the number of items (7).
   - Agent 0: \(401 / 7 \approx 57.29\)
   - Agent 1: \(310 / 7 \approx 44.29\)
   - Agent 2: \(381 / 7 \approx 54.43\)
   - Agent 3: \(248 / 7 \approx 35.43\)
   - Agent 4: \(365 / 7 \approx 52.14\)

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Utility**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives close to their average valuation.

4. **Allocation Process**:
   - Item 0: Agent 4 values it most (93).
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it most (93).
   - Item 2: Agent 3 values it most (92).
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it most (66).
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it most (82).
   - Item 5: Agent 0 values it most (81).
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it most (75).

The final allocation aims to maximize each agent's utility by considering individual item valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect the agent's preferences and ensure that each agent receives a fair portion of the total valuation.
