Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  12  53  64  28  98  14
1  73  44  98  29  54   7  30
2  19  83  31  43  60  85  12
3  97  28  63  50  23  70  97
4  82  42   1  49  34   8  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we should ensure that each agent receives a bundle that maximizes their satisfaction relative to what is available, while trying to prevent any one agent from desiring another's allocation more than their own.

Given the valuation matrix, let's begin by examining the preferences:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 3 shows high valuation for items 0 and 6.
- Agent 4 has a strong preference for item 6.

To achieve a fair division, we should attempt to allocate items in a way that respects these preferences while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible.

Let's propose the following allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0 (value 91)
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2 (value 98)
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 (value 85)
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items 1 and 3 (total value 28 + 50 = 78)
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items 4 and 6 (total value 34 + 88 = 122)

This allocation seeks to ensure that each agent gets their most valued item or a combination that maximizes their utility, given the constraints of distributing seven items.

Now, let's present the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items and considers maximizing individual satisfaction while maintaining fairness among agents.
