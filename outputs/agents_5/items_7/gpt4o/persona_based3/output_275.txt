Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  96  31  55  71  51  45  67
1  19  78  30  32  20  93  57
2  67  53  81  93  27  80   8
3  50  82  63  32  92  70  90
4  67  25  80  52   2  64   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the fair division problem and ensure envy-freeness, we need to allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share, based on their valuation of the items. A common approach to achieve this is to use the method of "maximum marginal utility" or "maximizing the minimum utility," which involves allocating items to the agent who values them the most, while considering the overall utility balance.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most (96). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values item 1 the most (82). Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the most (81). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most (93). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values item 4 the most (92). Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values item 5 the most (93). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values item 6 the most (90). Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

In this allocation, we aim to balance the agentsâ€™ satisfaction, considering their highest valuations for the items. Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 4, 6],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, optimizing for fairness and reducing envy among agents.
