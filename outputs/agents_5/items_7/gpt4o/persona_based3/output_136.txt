Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  82  60  70  89  26  49
1  21  59  89  55  21  15  66
2  88  76  29  40  71  79  31
3  52  84  44  41  77  50  16
4  53  46  76  93  19  48  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [53 46 76 93 19 48 84]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items in a way that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. Since we have five agents and seven items, it's impossible to give each agent the same number of items. Instead, we will aim to allocate the items so that the distribution is as fair as possible in terms of the valuations provided.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  82  60  70  89  26  49
1  21  59  89  55  21  15  66
2  88  76  29  40  71  79  31
3  52  84  44  41  77  50  16
4  53  46  76  93  19  48  84
```

Let's proceed to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the most (value: 89). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the most (value: 89). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most (value: 88). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the most (value: 84). Assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 the most (value: 93). Assign item 3 to agent 4.

Now, we have two items left: 5 and 6.

- **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 5 (value: 79), so we assign item 5 to agent 2.
- **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 6 (value: 84), so we assign item 6 to agent 4.

This allocation aims to maximize the total satisfaction based on the highest individual valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent is assigned items they value highly, thus reducing potential envy given the constraints of the problem.
