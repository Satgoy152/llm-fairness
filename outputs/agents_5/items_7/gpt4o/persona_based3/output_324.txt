Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  34  74   8  20  91  62  50
1   0  94   2  85  73  31  15
2  45  27  36  54  90   5  39
3  57  14  22  39  29  70  77
4  33  10  52  90   3  74   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a heuristic approach that aims to minimize envy among agents. One such approach is to allocate items in a manner that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 4 the highest at 91.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values item 1 the highest at 94.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values item 4 the highest at 90, but it's already allocated to agent 0.
   - Values item 3 next highest at 54.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values item 6 the highest at 77.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Values item 3 the highest at 90, but it's already allocated to agent 2.
   - Values item 5 next highest at 74.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 4.

After making these allocations, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate 2 more items.

6. **Remaining items 0 and 2**:
   - Item 0:
     - Highest remaining valuation is by agent 3 at 57.
     - Allocate item 0 to agent 3.
   - Item 2:
     - Highest remaining valuation is by agent 4 at 52.
     - Allocate item 2 to agent 4.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [6, 0]
- Agent 4: [5, 2]

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 0],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```
