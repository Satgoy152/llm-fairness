Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  85  48  26  44  42  57
1  90  15  65  10  14  86   6
2  65  20  54  15   4  24  76
3  16  48  54  81  52   6  82
4  13  93  58  18  72   5  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that considers each agent's preferences to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual satisfaction.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  85  48  26  44  42  57
1  90  15  65  10  14  86   6
2  65  20  54  15   4  24  76
3  16  48  54  81  52   6  82
4  13  93  58  18  72   5  51
```

We will assign items by considering each agent's highest valuation and then proceed to allocate the remaining items based on the remaining highest values.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is 85 for item 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is 90 for item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is 76 for item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is 82 for item 6 (already allocated), next highest is 81 for item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is 93 for item 1 (already allocated), next highest is 72 for item 4.

At this point, the allocation is:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4]

Remaining items: 2, 5

Next, we look at the highest remaining valuations for the leftover items:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest is 57 for item 6 (already allocated), then 48 for item 2.
- **Agent 1**: Next highest is 86 for item 5.
- **Agent 2**: Next highest is 54 for item 2.
- **Agent 3**: Next highest is 54 for item 2.
- **Agent 4**: Next highest is 58 for item 2.

Assign remaining items based on next highest preferences:
- Item 5 goes to Agent 1.
- Item 2 can go to Agent 4, who has the highest remaining preference for it.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4, 2]

Ensure that all items are allocated exactly once:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```
