Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  28  14  93  91  53  86
1  16  59  25  16  24  37  86
2  34  29  84  56  88  30  17
3  57  63  87   4  43  78  63
4  81   6  66  49  74  88  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One way to achieve this is by utilizing a round-robin or max-min allocation approach.

We will start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items to get an idea of their preferences. Then, we'll allocate items in such a way that each agent receives the items they value highly while maintaining an overall balance in the distribution of total value.

### Total Valuations:
- Agent 0: \(67 + 28 + 14 + 93 + 91 + 53 + 86 = 432\)
- Agent 1: \(16 + 59 + 25 + 16 + 24 + 37 + 86 = 263\)
- Agent 2: \(34 + 29 + 84 + 56 + 88 + 30 + 17 = 338\)
- Agent 3: \(57 + 63 + 87 + 4 + 43 + 78 + 63 = 395\)
- Agent 4: \(81 + 6 + 66 + 49 + 74 + 88 + 42 = 406\)

### Allocation Strategy:
Let's allocate the items by considering the highest value each agent places on the available items, while ensuring that each gets a fair share. We can use a greedy approach to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring no agent is left out.

1. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value 93).
2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 4 (highest value 88).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 (highest value 87).
4. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value 86).
5. Allocate item 0 to Agent 4 (highest value 81).
6. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value 88).
7. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value 59).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the items are allocated to the agents who value them the most.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```
