Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  49  41  59  32  35  42  36
1  13  52  94   9  50  86  96
2  51  17  61  77  16   9  53
3  29  86  58  23  14  30  31
4  31  67  74   3  48  64  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, I will aim for an envy-free or as close as possible allocation. Envy-freeness in this context means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuation. Given that there are 5 agents and 7 items, each agent cannot receive the same number of items. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 2 and 6, but since item 2 is already strongly preferred by agent 0, we prioritize item 6 for agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 1.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 highly.

Now, let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocated item 2 (highest valuation for agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Allocated items 6 and 5 (high valuation and second-highest preference).
- **Agent 2**: Allocated item 3 (highest valuation).
- **Agent 3**: Allocated item 1 (highest valuation).
- **Agent 4**: Allocated items 0 and 4 (high valuation for item 4, and item 0 is remaining).

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' preferences and minimize envy. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This way, each agent receives items based on their preferences as much as possible, and all 7 items are allocated.
