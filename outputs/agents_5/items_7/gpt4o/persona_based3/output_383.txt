Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  79  96  53   8  82  39  61
1  25  25  98  59  53  93   0
2   7  50  93  29  85  55  56
3  70  72  37  88  90  16  32
4  91  16  65  17  27  81   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and strive to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the constraints, an envy-free allocation might not always be possible, but we can aim for minimizing envy as much as possible.

Let's first look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items highly: 0, 1, 4
- Agent 1 values item highly: 2, 5
- Agent 2 values item highly: 2, 4
- Agent 3 values items highly: 3, 4
- Agent 4 values items highly: 0, 5

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 values items 0 and 1 highly, we give them these items.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 highly, so we give them item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 4 highly, so we give them item 4.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 highly, so we give them item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 5 highly, so we give them item 5.

After this initial allocation, we observe that item 6 is still unallocated. We need to allocate it to one of the agents. Let's allocate item 6 to agent 0, as they have a relatively lower total valuation compared to others with just items 0 and 1.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one of their higher-valued items and the envy is minimized, given the constraints.
