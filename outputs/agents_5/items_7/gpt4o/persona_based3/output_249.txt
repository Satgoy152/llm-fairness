Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  80  36  76  69   2  26
1  31  45  61  93  76  11  33
2  24  27  31   0  15  65  18
3  11  55  15  21  78  30  11
4  24  63  90  63  12  66  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a complex problem, and while an exact solution might not always be possible, we can attempt to make the allocation as fair as possible.

One approach is to use a method similar to the "maximin share" method, where we try to ensure each agent receives a bundle of items whose total value is as close as possible to what they would receive if the items were divided evenly among all agents.

Let's look at the valuation matrix:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 7  | 80 | 36 | 76 | 69 | 2  | 26 |
| 1          | 31 | 45 | 61 | 93 | 76 | 11 | 33 |
| 2          | 24 | 27 | 31 | 0  | 15 | 65 | 18 |
| 3          | 11 | 55 | 15 | 21 | 78 | 30 | 11 |
| 4          | 24 | 63 | 90 | 63 | 12 | 66 | 63 |

To begin, we can calculate the sum of each agent's valuations to have an idea of their total preference:

- Agent 0: 296
- Agent 1: 350
- Agent 2: 180
- Agent 3: 221
- Agent 4: 381

Now, let's allocate the items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 4** values item 2 highly (90), so we can allocate it to them.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 highly (93), so we allocate it to them.
3. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly (80), so we allocate it to them.
4. **Agent 2** values item 5 (65) the highest among their valuations, so we allocate it to them.
5. **Agent 3** values item 4 (78) the highest, so we allocate it to them.

Now we have two items left (0 and 6) and need to allocate them to balance the distributions:

- **Agent 0** can take item 0 (value 7).
- **Agent 4** can take item 6 (value 63).

This allocation attempts to respect the preferences and balance the distribution as fairly as possible.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```
