Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  52  31  72  29  32  15  58
1  62  57  64   4  22  14  39
2  97  67  57  10  89  16  23
3  40  37  36  11  57  54  94
4  37  47  94  33  61  29  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we will try to distribute these items so that each agent receives items of high value to them, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: Assign items where agents have a considerably higher valuation compared to others.
2. **Balance Total Value**: Ensure that the total value of items assigned to each agent is as balanced as possible.
3. **Complete Allocation**: Ensure all items are distributed, adhering to the constraints of integer allocations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 2 highly (72), which is the highest valuation for item 2. Also values item 0 (52) over others except agent 2.
- **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 0 (62) and item 2 (64).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 0 (97) highly, which is the highest valuation overall.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 6 (94) the highest compared to others.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 2 (94) highly, which is the highest valuation.

Letâ€™s assign based on these valuations:

- **Assign item 2 to Agent 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 4.
- **Assign item 0 to Agent 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 2.
- **Assign item 6 to Agent 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 3.
- **Assign item 1 to Agent 0**: Balances distribution and Agent 0 has a reasonable valuation.
- **Assign item 3 to Agent 1**: Agent 1 has a low valuation on item 3, but to balance items, it is given.
- **Assign item 4 to Agent 4**: Agent 4 has a high valuation which helps balance.
- **Assign item 5 to Agent 0**: Completes allocation with reasonable distribution.

The allocations based on the above strategy are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on high individual valuations, ensuring each agent receives items of value to them while minimizing envy.
