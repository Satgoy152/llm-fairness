Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  88  71  27  65  23  32
1  25  39  83  55  52  23  66
2  68   8  69   7  22  56  32
3   4  87  49  43  85  29  19
4  37  72  75  70  52  14  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [37 72 75 70 52 14 75]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations from the table, we need to ensure that the allocation maximizes each agent's utility based on their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the most (88).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the most (83).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most (68).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 the most (85).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 the most (75).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items such that each agent gets at least one item and the overall allocation remains fair. The remaining items are 3 and 5.

6. **Agent 4** can also be given item 2 (75) since it is the highest value left for Agent 4.
7. **Agent 1** can be given item 5 (23), since it is not highly valued by any other agent except Agent 2, who already has their highest value item.

Here's the allocation based on this strategy:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and tries to maximize the individual satisfaction based on the given valuations.
