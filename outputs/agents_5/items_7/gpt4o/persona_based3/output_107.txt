Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  39  60  15  29  70  51
1  44  37  34  94  81  25  99
2  66   2  11   2  38  93  39
3  42  95  38  97  45  36  69
4  93  27  44  87  84  83  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. Our goal is to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy and ensures each agent gets integer quantities of items.

Let's break down the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (70), 2 (60), 6 (51)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 6 (99), 3 (94), 4 (81)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (93), 0 (66), 4 (38)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (97), 1 (95), 6 (69)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued items: 0 (93), 3 (87), 4 (84)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 4

Next, we need to allocate the remaining items to maintain fairness. We have items 1 and 2 left to allocate.

6. **Agent 3**:
   - Second choice would be item 1 (95)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3

7. **Agent 0**:
   - Next highest available is item 2 (60)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives items that they have relatively high valuations for, thus minimizing envy and ensuring fairness. Each agent gets at least one item, and all 7 items are distributed.
