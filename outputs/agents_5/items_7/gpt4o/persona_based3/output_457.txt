Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  67  45  80  88  61  99
1  37  61  66  88  24   8  32
2  38  25  39  28  55  23  37
3  93  45  63  94  12  13  90
4  70  15  10   9  99  55  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations for each item. Given the table of valuations, the goal is to distribute items such that no agent envies another's allocation, if possible.

First, we need to calculate the total value each agent perceives from all items and then try to distribute them to balance these values as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent** to ensure each agent receives items they highly value.
2. **Allocate items to agents** such that the perceived value is balanced, aiming for envy-freeness.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 6 (value = 99). 
- **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (value = 88).
- **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (value = 55).
- **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (value = 94), but since it is already allocated, we can allocate item 0 (value = 93).
- **Agent 4** highly values item 4 (value = 99), but since it is already allocated, we can allocate item 5 (value = 55).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** can also receive items 1 (value = 67) and 5 (value = 61) to balance out total perceived value.
- **Agent 3** can also receive item 2 (value = 63).
- **Agent 4** can receive item 4 (value = 99), which was initially listed for Agent 2, but we can swap as Agent 4 values it more.

After balancing through swaps and ensuring each agent receives at least one item, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items with high valuation to them while keeping the total number of items distributed to be exactly 7, ensuring fairness in terms of individual valuations.
