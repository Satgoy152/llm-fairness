Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  92  27   8  77  53  52
1  37  87  97   8  16  92  35
2  94  74  17  25  61  79  90
3  78  85  43  49  10   1  80
4  85   0  27  17   6  31  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their own valuations. Given the valuations provided, we can use an algorithmic approach like the adjusted winner procedure or a greedy method to approximate a fair division.

Let's explore a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 1, so it's optimal to give them this item.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2, therefore, they should receive item 2.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 6, so giving them these items would be favorable.
4. Agent 3 has somewhat balanced valuations, but item 3 is relatively more valuable to them.
5. Agent 4 doesn't have very high valuations, but they might prefer item 5 due to its relative value to them.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0)
- Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1)
- Items 0 and 6 to Agent 2 (high combined value)
- Item 3 to Agent 3 (reasonable value)
- Item 5 to Agent 4 (relatively higher value for this agent)

Now we need to ensure that all items are allocated and no agent receives more than 2 items:

- Items 4 remains unallocated. Agent 0 might receive this as it adds value without causing envy.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 0, 6
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 5

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest valuations and attempts to minimize envy by distributing the items fairly according to their preferences.
