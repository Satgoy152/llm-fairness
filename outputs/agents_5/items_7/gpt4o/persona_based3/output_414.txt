Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  21  68   9  40  13  32
1  44  69  70  63  82  43  37
2  94   9  94   6  72  85  80
3  59  64  48  93  13  67  42
4  41  48  50  98  75  89  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we need to consider the preferences of each agent for the items and ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation more than their own. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Let's review the valuations of each agent for the items:

- Agent 0: [72, 21, 68, 9, 40, 13, 32]
- Agent 1: [44, 69, 70, 63, 82, 43, 37]
- Agent 2: [94, 9, 94, 6, 72, 85, 80]
- Agent 3: [59, 64, 48, 93, 13, 67, 42]
- Agent 4: [41, 48, 50, 98, 75, 89, 77]

A common approach to fair division in such cases is using the "maximum envy-free" allocation where each agent will get at least one item they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

Let's start allocating items based on each agent's highest valuation:

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 and 2 the highest, both at 94. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 4** highly values item 3 at 98. Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 at 82. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3 at 93, but it has been assigned. The next highest available is item 5 at 67. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 0** has item 2 as their next highest value at 68. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
6. Since item 2 was already assigned to Agent 0, consider Agent 0's next highest available item, item 6 at 32. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1** has item 1 as their next highest value at 69. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items [2, 6]
- Agent 1 receives items [1, 4]
- Agent 2 receives item [0]
- Agent 3 receives item [5]
- Agent 4 receives item [3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value, minimizing envy among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
