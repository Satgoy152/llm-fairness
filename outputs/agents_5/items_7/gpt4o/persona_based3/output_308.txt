Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  38  71  57  78   8  91
1  88  61  43  63  85  31  24
2  95  44  34  76  81  83  54
3  26  46  68  62   2   0  82
4  52  41  16  87  63  19  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, meaning that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation. This is a challenging task, especially with integer allocations, but we can use a heuristic approach to attempt a fair distribution.

Let's start by considering the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [35, 38, 71, 57, 78, 8, 91]
Agent 1: [88, 61, 43, 63, 85, 31, 24]
Agent 2: [95, 44, 34, 76, 81, 83, 54]
Agent 3: [26, 46, 68, 62, 2, 0, 82]
Agent 4: [52, 41, 16, 87, 63, 19, 72]
```

We will use a simple round-robin allocation based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item that has not yet been allocated.

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest (95). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** values item 6 the highest (91). Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (88), but it's taken. Next highest is item 4 (85). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest (87). Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
5. **Agent 3** values item 6 the highest (82), but it's taken. Next highest is item 2 (68). Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 2** next values item 5 (83). Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 0** values item 4 (78), but it's taken. Next highest is item 3 (57), but it's taken. Next is item 1 (38). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Now, all items have been allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 6 and 1
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 3

This allocation gives a fair distribution based on the highest available valuations per round.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```
