Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  30  21  20  12  97   8
1   5  71  40  18   2  93  83
2  56  77   8  16  95  63  84
3  53  32  70  74  45   8  46
4  67  79  89  75  47  94  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share, given their preferences.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Identify items that have exceptionally high valuations by multiple agents. These can be pivotal in ensuring fairness.

2. **Balance Total Value:** Try to balance the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items. This may not be perfectly equal, but it should be reasonably close to ensure fairness.

3. **Consider Envy:** Minimize situations where an agent significantly envies another agent's allocation. This involves ensuring each agent gets at least some items they highly value.

Let's determine allocations based on the table provided:

### Valuation Table Recap
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  30  21  20  12  97   8
1   5  71  40  18   2  93  83
2  56  77   8  16  95  63  84
3  53  32  70  74  45   8  46
4  67  79  89  75  47  94  94
```

### Proposed Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Item 5 (Valuation: 97)
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 6 (Valuations: 71, 83)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (Valuation: 95)
- **Agent 3**: Items 2 and 3 (Valuations: 70, 74)
- **Agent 4**: Item 0 (Valuation: 67)

This allocation aims to balance the high-value items among agents and reduce envy. The choice of items for each agent considers their highest-value preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.

### Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items and attempts to align with each agent's highest valuations, aiming for a fair and envy-minimized division.
