Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  36  67  26  53  35  36  81
1   4  75  20  63  98  36  90
2  86  21  70   9  40  54   5
3  96   2  22  97  26  83   6
4  66  26  39  36  96  38  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to minimize envy as much as possible. A common approach for this type of problem is to use the method of "envy-freeness" or "maximum marginal utility." Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate one item at a time based on the highest marginal increase in utility for an agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from agent 3 with a value of 96. Allocate item 0 to agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from agent 0 with a value of 67. Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from agent 2 with a value of 70. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from agent 3 with a value of 97. Allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from agent 1 with a value of 98. Allocate item 4 to agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is from agent 3 with a value of 83. Allocate item 5 to agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is from agent 0 with a value of 81. Allocate item 6 to agent 0.

This allocation maximizes the total utility for each agent based on their highest preferences and attempts to minimize envy. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 3, 5],
    "4": []
}
```
