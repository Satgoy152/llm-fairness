Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  15  74  24  34  93  60
1  71  53  30  63  18   5  10
2  35   4  97  80  14  99  44
3  22  40  31  42  73  28  68
4  83  66   7   3   6  19  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while focusing on envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, we can employ a method like the Envy-Free Matching or a similar heuristic to distribute the items.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. **Item 5** has a high value for Agent 2 (99), so it is allocated to Agent 2.

2. **Item 2** is highly valued by Agent 0 (74), so it is allocated to Agent 0.

3. **Item 6** is relatively more valuable to Agent 3 (68), so it is allocated to Agent 3.

4. **Item 0** is most valuable to Agent 4 (83), so it is allocated to Agent 4.

5. **Item 3** is relatively balanced across Agents 0 and 1, but Agent 1 has a higher value for it (63), so it is allocated to Agent 1.

6. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 4 (66), but since Agent 4 already has an item, we'll consider a more balanced approach and allocate it to Agent 1, who has the second-highest valuation (53).

7. **Item 4** is more valuable to Agent 3 (73) than to the other agents, so it is allocated to Agent 3.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and attempts to minimize envy among the agents.
