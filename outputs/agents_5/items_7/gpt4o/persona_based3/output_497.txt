Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  23  56  79  50  81  61
1  19  28  61  77  78  72  43
2  46  29  21  27   6  79  87
3  85  86  47  68  98  94  49
4  15  60  61  25  60   6  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to use principles of fair division such as envy-freeness, proportionality, or maximizing total welfare. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer constraints, we'll try to balance the allocations in a way that is as fair as possible.

One approach is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets close to the same number of items and that overall envy is minimized.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 and 5.
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 3.
- **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 6 and 5.
- **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 1 and 0.
- **Agent 4** has relatively balanced valuations but prefers item 2.

Considering these preferences, we can attempt the following allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Assign item 3 (value 79) and item 0 (value 8).
2. **Agent 1:** Assign item 4 (value 78) and item 1 (value 28).
3. **Agent 2:** Assign item 6 (value 87).
4. **Agent 3:** Assign item 5 (value 94).
5. **Agent 4:** Assign item 2 (value 61).

This allocation tries to give each agent items they value highly, while distributing the items across the agents. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation fulfills the requirement of distributing all 7 items and aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their individual valuations.
