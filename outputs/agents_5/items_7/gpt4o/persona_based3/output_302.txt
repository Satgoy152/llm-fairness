Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  79  81  67  73   3   3
1  61  32  50  50   7   3  92
2  59   2  89  43  66  93  43
3  68  93  98  85  37  14  91
4  20  10  57  78  50  34  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can try to maximize each agent's utility based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair portion of the total value, given their preferences.

Let's proceed to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Highest value items for Agent 0: Item 2 (value 81), Item 1 (value 79)
   - Allocate Item 2 and Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Highest value items for Agent 1: Item 6 (value 92), Item 0 (value 61)
   - Allocate Item 6 and Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Highest value items for Agent 2: Item 5 (value 93), Item 2 (value 89)
   - Item 2 is already allocated, so next best is Item 4 (value 66)
   - Allocate Item 5 and Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Highest value items for Agent 3: Item 2 (value 98), Item 1 (value 93)
   - Both items are already allocated, next best is Item 3 (value 85)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:  
   - Highest value items for Agent 4: Item 6 (value 96)
   - Item 6 is already allocated, next best is Item 3 (value 78)
   - Item 3 is already allocated, next best is Item 4 (value 50), but it is allocated.
   - Next available item is Item 0 (value 20), but it's allocated.
   - Allocate no items to Agent 4, as all others are claimed.

Now, let's ensure each item is allocated and summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 3: Item [3]
- Agent 4: []

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": []
}
```
