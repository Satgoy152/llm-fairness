Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  37  87  30  63  59  23
1  61  53  75  96  14   0  27
2  65  19  72  92  36   1  10
3  30  95  69   3  37  22  94
4   8  58  74  81  35  42  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to allocate the items in such a way that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a complex problem, but a simple approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where each agent picks their most valued item in turns. 

The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels that they have received a "fair" portion, given their valuations. We'll iterate through the agents and allow each to pick their highest-valued remaining item. This approach typically works well for small numbers of items and agents.

Let's go through this process:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 2 (value 87).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 3 (value 96).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 3 (value 92). However, since it's taken, they pick item 0 (value 65).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 1 (value 95).
5. **Agent 4** picks item 3 (value 81). However, since it's taken, they pick item 6 (value 78).
6. **Back to Agent 0**, they now pick item 4 (value 63).
7. **Agent 1** picks item 0 (value 61). However, since it's taken, they pick item 2 (value 75).

Since there are only 7 items, we may need to adjust for the remaining items:

- Items 3 (picked twice) and item 5 are not yet picked.
- Agent 2 has only one item (item 0), so they get item 5 (value 1) as their second pick.
- Agent 3 picks no second item because they already have item 1, which is highly valued.
- Agent 4 has only one picked item (item 6), and item 5 is already taken. So, they get item 3.

Let's allocate the items based on the above steps:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.
