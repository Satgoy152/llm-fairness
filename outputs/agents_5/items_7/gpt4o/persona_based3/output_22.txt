Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  98  62  41  66  50  69
1  62  40  12  60  14  73  62
2  23   1  84  68  67  93  51
3  81  95  71   4  50  28   3
4   2  52  93  49  28  28  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations. Given the table of valuations, we can attempt to allocate items to maximize fairness.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 3 (value 81 for agent 3, the highest among others).
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 98 for agent 0, the highest among others).
- Assign item 2 to agent 4 (value 93 for agent 4, the highest among others).
- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 60 for agent 1, which is significant compared to other values).
- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 66 for agent 0, the highest among others).
- Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 93 for agent 2, the highest among others).
- Assign item 6 to agent 4 (value 96 for agent 4, the highest among others).

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on the highest individual valuations for each item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every item is assigned, and each agent receives an integer number of items, with no agent receiving more than two items.
