Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  66  70  32  91  40   9
1  83  91  48  48  89  63  56
2  92  64  41  57  43  98  69
3  67  42  84  17  74  64  36
4  11  53  33  21  30  44  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value the allocation of any other agent.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** values items 1 and 0 highly.
3. **Agent 2** prefers items 5 and 0.
4. **Agent 3** values items 2 and 5.
5. **Agent 4** prefers item 6 highly.

We need to ensure that each agent gets some items and feels they have a fair share considering their own valuations.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value: 92).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value: 91).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value: 84).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value: 48).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value: 91).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value: 98).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (value: 91).

This allocation seeks to balance the high-value items among the agents while considering each agent's preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation achieves a distribution where each agent gets at least one item, and it attempts to maximize the total value received by each agent according to their individual valuations.
