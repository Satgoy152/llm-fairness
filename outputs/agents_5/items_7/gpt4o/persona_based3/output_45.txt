Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86   5   1   5  39  28  97
1  31  12  80  77  43  67  83
2  11  14   4  57  88  29  20
3  73  62  46   1  35  15   7
4  65  93  51  93  76  36  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We will use a method that takes into account each agent's preferences to minimize envy.

Here's a fair allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 6, so we assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** places the highest value on item 2, so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most, so we assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most, so we assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values items 1 and 3 equally and highly, but since item 1 has the highest valuation for any item by any agent, we assign item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, we have assigned items 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6. We still need to allocate items 3 and 5:

- For **item 3**, Agent 1 values it significantly, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- For **item 5**, Agent 1 has the next highest preference, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

Thus, the final allocation seeks to maximize each agent's perceived value while minimizing the potential for envy:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one of their highly valued items, while the total number of items allocated remains 7, fulfilling the problem's requirements.
