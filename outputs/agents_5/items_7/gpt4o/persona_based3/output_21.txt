Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27  43  87  91  95  14  29
1  69  16  99  88   0  62  67
2  28  44  19  14  79  35  55
3  42  70  30  80   8  19  49
4  53  86  68  99  14  33   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent based on their own valuation. We'll use a simple heuristic approach to achieve a reasonable allocation.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 4 and 3 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most.

To maximize fairness, we can try to assign each agent their most valued item, and then distribute the remaining items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives:

1. **Assign each agent their highest valued item:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4
   - Agent 1: Item 2
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (but already taken, so next best is Item 6)
   - Agent 3: Item 3
   - Agent 4: Item 3 (but already taken, so next best is Item 1)

2. **Distribute remaining items to balance total values:**
   - Agent 0: Already has Item 4, add Item 0
   - Agent 1: Already has Item 2, add Item 5
   - Agent 2: Already has Item 6
   - Agent 3: Already has Item 3
   - Agent 4: Already has Item 1, add Item 5

Now, let's verify:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 0
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 1

This allocation uses all items and attempts to respect the top preferences as much as possible:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with an attempt to provide a fair division based on the agents' valuation of the items.
