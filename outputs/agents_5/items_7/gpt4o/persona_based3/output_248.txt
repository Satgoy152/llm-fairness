Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  43  69  10  74   9  93
1   4  95  30  11  48  54   7
2  53  39  96  94  89  20  59
3  66  78  96  97  30  57  17
4  31  19  77  94  66  79  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free distribution. This means that each agent should not prefer someone else's allocation over their own.

Given the agents' valuations for each item, we can use the following heuristic approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** First, compute the total value each agent assigns to all the items. This gives us a sense of how much each agent values the entire set of items.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Start by allocating items that have a high individual valuation for an agent compared to others. This ensures that each agent receives their most valued items first, reducing potential envy.

3. **Iterative Adjustment:** Adjust the allocation iteratively to balance the total value of items each agent receives. The goal is to ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible according to the agents' valuations.

4. **Ensure Completeness:** Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives a whole number of items.

Let's proceed with this process:

1. **Total Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: 372
   - Agent 1: 249
   - Agent 2: 450
   - Agent 3: 441
   - Agent 4: 420

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Maximal Individual Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (74)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (95)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (96)
   - Item 3: Agent 3 (97)
   - Item 4: Agent 0 (74)
   - Item 5: Agent 4 (79)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (93)

3. **Adjustments to Ensure Fairness:**
   With the initial allocation, Agent 0 ends up with too many items and a high total valuation. We need to redistribute some items to balance the allocation.

   - Swap Item 6 (93) from Agent 0 to Agent 2, where it has a reasonable valuation (59).
   - Swap Item 4 (74) from Agent 0 to Agent 4, where it has a reasonable valuation (66).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items [0]
   - Agent 1: Items [1]
   - Agent 2: Items [2, 6]
   - Agent 3: Items [3]
   - Agent 4: Items [4, 5]

The final allocation ensures that each agent receives items with a high valuation for them, and the distribution is balanced according to their preferences.

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
