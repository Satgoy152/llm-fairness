Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  51  22  50   0  13  13
1   2  56  93  88   1  46  75
2  13  98  26  29   0  14  19
3  83  61  66  59  66  89  81
4  23  33  94  45  39   8  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible, given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (51). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (93). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest, but it is already allocated. Their next highest is item 3 (29). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (89). Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the highest, but it is already allocated. Their next highest is item 6 (71). Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

### Remaining Items:
- Items 0 and 4 remain unallocated.

6. **Reallocate Remaining Items**:
   - Item 0: Highest unallocated value is for Agent 3 (83). Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
   - Item 4: Highest unallocated value is for Agent 3 (66). Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 4, 5],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed such that each agent receives items based on their individual preferences as much as possible, and we achieve a balance across the agents given the integer allocation constraint.
