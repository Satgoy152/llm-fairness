Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  65  63   6  69   6  81  85
1  13  31  85  99  16  15  90
2  11  15  50   2  41  18  15
3  53  55  88   2  15  95  36
4  31  57  32  57  51  40   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy among the agents. One possible approach is to use the envy-free allocation method, such as the adjusted winner procedure or the maximum Nash welfare method. For simplicity, I will use a heuristic approach to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that reduces potential envy.

Let's evaluate the valuations and try to allocate items accordingly:

1. Find the highest value each agent has for an item and assign that item to the agent if it doesn't cause significant envy.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to minimize envy while ensuring all items are allocated.

Based on the valuations given:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (value 85).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (value 99).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (value 95).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value 50).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most (value 57).

Let's start by assigning these highest-valued items to each agent:

- Agent 0: item 6
- Agent 1: item 3
- Agent 2: item 2
- Agent 3: item 5
- Agent 4: item 1

Now we have assigned 5 items. We need to assign the remaining items 0 and 4. Let's look at the remaining unassigned items and try to distribute them:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 0 (second highest value for item 0 is by Agent 3, but Agent 0 has a higher valuation for other items).
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 4 (no major contender for item 4, and it fits with Agent 4's distribution).

Thus, the allocation becomes:

- Agent 0: [6, 0]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [1, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets their highest-valued item, and the remaining items are distributed to reduce envy. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
