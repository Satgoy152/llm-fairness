Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  40  91  74  50  82  35
1  72  47  33  49  39  65  58
2  82  90  14  72   7  60  22
3  13  95  60  55  36  15  37
4  36  87  11  56   2  99  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as much as or more than any other agent's bundle. Given the valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies another.

Let's first examine the total valuation each agent has for all items combined:

- Agent 0: 48 + 40 + 91 + 74 + 50 + 82 + 35 = 420
- Agent 1: 72 + 47 + 33 + 49 + 39 + 65 + 58 = 363
- Agent 2: 82 + 90 + 14 + 72 + 7 + 60 + 22 = 347
- Agent 3: 13 + 95 + 60 + 55 + 36 + 15 + 37 = 311
- Agent 4: 36 + 87 + 11 + 56 + 2 + 99 + 86 = 377

Based on these sums, we can attempt to allocate items to balance the total perceived values for each agent. We will aim to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction given their preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share.

After further analysis, an allocation that seems fairly balanced is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2 (valuations: 48, 91)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 6 (valuations: 47, 58)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (valuation: 72)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (valuation: 36)
- Agent 4: Items 5 (valuation: 99)

This allocation looks like:

Agent 0 receives items 0 and 2, which they value highly.  
Agent 1 receives items 1 and 6.  
Agent 2 receives item 3.  
Agent 3 receives item 4.  
Agent 4 receives item 5, which they value the most.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```
