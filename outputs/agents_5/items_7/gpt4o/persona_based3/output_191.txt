Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  26  88  20  30  74  90
1  76   3  59  83  49  15  36
2  43  99  27   9  80  84  78
3  74  92  23  81  92   1   2
4  61   9  71  34  34   9  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of fairness and possibly envy-freeness. While achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible with integer allocations, we can aim for a fair distribution based on the given valuations.

One common method is to use the "maximum marginal value" approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. This might not always be envy-free, but it ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it most highly, which is a reasonable fairness criterion.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate each item to the agent who values it most:

- Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 1 (76)
- Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 2 (99)
- Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 0 (88)
- Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 1 (83)
- Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 3 (92)
- Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 2 (84)
- Item 6: Highest value is by Agent 0 (90)

Now, let's allocate the items based on these assignments:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: No items

Finally, the allocations in the requested JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": []
}
```
