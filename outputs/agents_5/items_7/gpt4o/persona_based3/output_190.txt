Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  14  77  21  74  39  30
1  81  14  70  57  59  37  73
2  23  70  43  79   0  89  45
3  86  72  12  94  83  81  48
4  64  78   9  71  70  99  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 5 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for an envy-free allocation. The goal is to allocate the 7 items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a potential approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate each agent's total valuation of all items to understand their overall preferences.
2. Allocate items to agents by considering both their individual valuations and the goal of minimizing envy across agents.
3. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 6.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3, 5, and 0.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for item 5.

Considering these preferences and aiming for an envy-free allocation, we can assign items as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 0: Item 0 (reassign to balance the allocation)

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the total number of allocated items is 7.
