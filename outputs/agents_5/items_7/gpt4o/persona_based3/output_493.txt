Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  20  98  43  95  58  38   6
1  14  75  43  10  16  67  71
2  29   5  69   7  85  63  60
3  69  68  77  46  67  39  71
4  35  89  44   0   1  50  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we can attempt to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while considering fairness.

Here is an allocation strategy based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while attempting to minimize envy:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 3.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 5.
3. Agent 2 highly values items 4 and 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values items 0 and 6.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 1, but it is already taken by Agent 0, so they are allocated item 5 which is the next best for them and available.

Let's distribute the items based on these priorities:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 0, 6
- Agent 4: Item 2

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value relatively highly, while also making sure all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [2]
}
```
