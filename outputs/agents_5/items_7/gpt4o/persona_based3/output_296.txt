Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  80  51  67  13  68  99   0
1  72  37  53  31  36  94  61
2  50  37  50  58  88  37  75
3  58  27  39  56  39  30  59
4  30  21  40  85  53  66  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent feels they received as much as they deserve based on their valuations. We proceed by analyzing the given valuations and attempting to maximize each agent's total perceived value without causing envy.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 80 + 51 + 67 + 13 + 68 + 99 + 0 = 378
- Agent 1: 72 + 37 + 53 + 31 + 36 + 94 + 61 = 384
- Agent 2: 50 + 37 + 50 + 58 + 88 + 37 + 75 = 395
- Agent 3: 58 + 27 + 39 + 56 + 39 + 30 + 59 = 308
- Agent 4: 30 + 21 + 40 + 85 + 53 + 66 + 31 = 326

Now, we will allocate items to ensure fairness and minimize envy:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value (99) for them.
2. Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it has a significant value (75) for them.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value (88) for them.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it has a high value (72) for them.
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 4, as it has the highest value (85) for them.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it has a significant value (67) for them.
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 3, as it has a value (27) that fits their profile and helps balance allocations.

Here's the fair allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the distribution of items based on the agents' preferences and total valuation to create an envy-free scenario. Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
