Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  85  47   2   9  13  93
1  34  48   3  61   3  92  94
2  57  72  81  13  62   1  78
3  95  23   3  63  53  82  17
4  40  24  76   4  96  30  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes jealousy (envy) among agents. One possible approach is to use the Envy-Free mechanism, which attempts to allocate items such that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent based on their valuations.

We have 5 agents and 7 items to allocate. Here's a possible allocation that attempts to balance the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 6 highly (93), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 highly (92), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 highly (81), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 highly (95), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 4 highly (96), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have two more items (1 and 3) to allocate:

6. **Item 1**: The highest valuation left for item 1 is by Agent 0 (85). Since Agent 0 has only one item so far, we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
7. **Item 3**: The highest valuation left for item 3 is by Agent 1 (61). Since Agent 1 has only one item so far, we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their highest valuations, and all items are distributed.

Here are the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction according to their highest value items.
