Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  99  58  34   7  46  91
1  24  34  43   6  11  13  28
2  29  91  89  70  49  19   0
3  97  90  57  13   8  45  18
4  52   9  98  81  91  53   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations, we can use a method such as the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which focuses on maximizing the product of the agents' utilities. This approach often leads to envy-free allocations under certain conditions, though it may not always guarantee perfect envy-freeness.

Let's evaluate the possible allocations:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is for item 1, followed by items 0 and 6.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is for item 2, followed by items 1 and 0.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is for item 1, followed by items 2 and 3.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value is for item 0, followed by items 1 and 2.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value is for item 2, followed by items 4 and 3.

Based on these preferences, we try to assign items in a manner that maximizes the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 3
- **Agent 3**: Item 0
- **Agent 4**: Items 4 and 5

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on individual preferences and total satisfaction. The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent's high valuation items are considered to the best extent.
