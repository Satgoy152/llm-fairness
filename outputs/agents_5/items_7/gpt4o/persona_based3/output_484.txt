Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  76  88  15  58  74  89
1  37  84  59  12  24  44  34
2  28  68  50  55  71   0  16
3  39  48  18  90  30   0  98
4  35  48  96  83  19  78  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents considering their valuations, we should aim for an envy-free allocation if possible, or at least a fair division based on maximizing the total utility each agent derives from their allocated items. Given the valuations, let's proceed to find a reasonable allocation.

Here are the valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: [23, 76, 88, 15, 58, 74, 89]
- Agent 1: [37, 84, 59, 12, 24, 44, 34]
- Agent 2: [28, 68, 50, 55, 71, 0, 16]
- Agent 3: [39, 48, 18, 90, 30, 0, 98]
- Agent 4: [35, 48, 96, 83, 19, 78, 53]

One approach is to allocate the highest valued items to each agent and ensure no agent is left completely dissatisfied. Let's try to minimize envy by considering each agentâ€™s top picks and distributing accordingly.

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (89).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (84).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (71).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (90).
- Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (96).

Next, allocate these items to their most valued agents and proceed with the remaining items:

1. Agent 0 gets item 6.
2. Agent 1 gets item 1.
3. Agent 2 gets item 4.
4. Agent 3 gets item 3.
5. Agent 4 gets item 2.

Now, we have items 0 and 5 left. Let's allocate them to those who would gain relatively more value:

- For item 0:
  - Agent 1 values it at 37, which is higher than Agents 2, 3, and 4.
  - Agent 1 receives item 0.

- For item 5:
  - Agent 0 values it at 74, which is higher than Agents 2, 3, and 4.
  - Agent 0 receives item 5.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's utility from the items they highly value, potentially leading to a fair division where envy is minimized.
