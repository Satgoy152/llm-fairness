Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  15  13  73  57  83  50  75
1  51  89  22  48  95   7  91
2   8  47  67  29  15   8  29
3  31  22  61  17  32  60  23
4  32  52  55  80  80  53  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can start by examining the valuations and trying to allocate the highest-valued items to the agents who value them the most, while also ensuring that each agent ends up with a fair share of the total value. Since there are 7 items and 5 agents, not every agent will receive an item, but the goal is to make sure the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's first calculate the total value of all items according to each agent and then proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values: 15 + 13 + 73 + 57 + 83 + 50 + 75 = 366
2. Agent 1 values: 51 + 89 + 22 + 48 + 95 + 7 + 91 = 403
3. Agent 2 values: 8 + 47 + 67 + 29 + 15 + 8 + 29 = 203
4. Agent 3 values: 31 + 22 + 61 + 17 + 32 + 60 + 23 = 246
5. Agent 4 values: 32 + 52 + 55 + 80 + 80 + 53 + 45 = 397

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4 (95), and also values item 1 (89) highly. Allocating item 4 and item 6 (which they also value highly) to Agent 1.
- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (73) and item 5 (50). Allocating items 2 and 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 4 highly values item 3 (80) and has significant valuation for item 0 (32). Allocating items 3 and 0 to Agent 4.
- Agent 3 and Agent 2 don't stand out in terms of high valuations compared to others, but Agent 3 values item 1 more than Agent 2. Allocating item 1 to Agent 3.

This allocation reflects a fair division based on the agents' preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is valued by at least one agent among the highest, and no items are left unallocated.
