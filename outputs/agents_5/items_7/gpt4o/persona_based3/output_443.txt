Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  35  64  80  75  43  99
1  63  58  36  29  35  72  36
2  49  66  58  94  67  58   2
3  68   4  59  40  42  85  59
4   0   7  66  86  26  56   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0  7 66 86 26 56  9]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations table, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels satisfied with their share, based on their own valuations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Given the high valuation for item 6, assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 to agent 1, as they value it the most among the items.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 3 to agent 2, as it has the highest valuation for them.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 to agent 3, given their relatively high valuation compared to other items.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 2 to agent 4, as itâ€™s valued the highest by them.

Now there are two items left, items 0 and 1. We need to allocate these considering the remaining agents and their valuations:

6. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 to agent 0, given their high valuation.
7. **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 to agent 2, as it provides a reasonable value and balances the total allocation for them.

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 2

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual satisfaction based on their valuations.

{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
