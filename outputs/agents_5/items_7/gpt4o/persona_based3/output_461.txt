Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  68  58  59  49  69  62  61
1   7  49  38  16  82   6  83
2  54  65  29  68  88  67   8
3  89  82   9  80  96  75  58
4  93  96  88  39  46  70  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that they have received a fair share given their preferences.

To achieve this, we will attempt to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents. Here, satisfaction can be defined as the sum of the values of the items allocated to each agent.

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 68 + 58 + 59 + 49 + 69 + 62 + 61 = 426
   - Agent 1: 7 + 49 + 38 + 16 + 82 + 6 + 83 = 281
   - Agent 2: 54 + 65 + 29 + 68 + 88 + 67 + 8 = 379
   - Agent 3: 89 + 82 + 9 + 80 + 96 + 75 + 58 = 489
   - Agent 4: 93 + 96 + 88 + 39 + 46 + 70 + 40 = 472

2. Distribute items to maximize the minimum satisfaction:
   - Give priority to agents who have high valuations for specific items not valued as highly by others.

3. Allocation:
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value at 96).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (second-highest value at 80).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (highest value at 96).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value at 6, marginal for others).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (relatively high value at 68 compared to others).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (high value at 88).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (highest value at 83).

We have now allocated all items with the goal of balancing the satisfaction across agents.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```
