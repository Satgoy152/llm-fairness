Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  76  65  69   5  90  83
1  62  90  21  38   4  96  63
2  90   6  91   6  15  32  55
3  24  68  32  42  75  16  12
4  33  80  40  70  99   8  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that they received a fair share of items based on their valuations. Given the valuations provided, we'll attempt to allocate the items such that no agent envies another.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item:**  
   Compute the total value for each item across all agents to identify items that have high combined valuations.

2. **Greedy Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**  
   Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than one item until all agents have received one item, or it is impossible to do so.

3. **Iterate to Allocate Remaining Items:**  
   Continue the allocation process by considering the next highest valuation available for each remaining item, ensuring that the allocation remains as fair as possible.

Based on the valuations given, here is a possible allocation that seeks to balance fairness:

- **Item 0:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (90)
- **Item 1:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (90)
- **Item 2:** Highest valuation by Agent 2 (91)
- **Item 3:** Highest valuation by Agent 4 (70)
- **Item 4:** Highest valuation by Agent 4 (99)
- **Item 5:** Highest valuation by Agent 1 (96)
- **Item 6:** Highest valuation by Agent 0 (83)

To ensure each agent gets at least one item, let's adjust the allocation slightly:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 6]
- Agent 1 gets item [5]
- Agent 2 gets item [2]
- Agent 3 gets item [3]
- Agent 4 gets items [0, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
