Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  90  16  37  50  92  82
1   4  18  47  52  12  32  74
2  50  67  57  17  12  21   9
3  32  87  46  15  13  80  72
4  36  61  45  32  95  37  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider a method that can help achieve envy-freeness or at least minimize envy as much as possible. One such method is the "Round Robin" allocation, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item. 

Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Determine the order of picking:** One simple way to determine the order is based on some random or predetermined criterion. For simplicity, let's assume agents pick in the order of their agent numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and then repeat.

2. **Conduct the allocation:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 92).
   - Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 74).
   - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 67).
   - Agent 3 picks item 0 (value 59).
   - Agent 4 picks item 4 (value 95).
   
   Now, we have two items left: 2 and 3.
   
   - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 37).
   - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 47).

3. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Agent 0: [5, 3]
   - Agent 1: [6, 2]
   - Agent 2: [1]
   - Agent 3: [0]
   - Agent 4: [4]

Ensure the allocation is fair by checking that each agent has picked according to their preferences as best as possible.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the process follows a reasonable method of allocation that aims to minimize envy.
