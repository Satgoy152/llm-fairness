Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  93  30  18  82   8  24
1  77  53  46  37  51  96  54
2  13  38  45  84  63  40   1
3  49  66  71  83  38  18  14
4  40  26  52   1  87  53  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the allocation is as fair as possible. One approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 73     | 93     | 30     | 18     | 82     | 8      | 24     |
| 1     | 77     | 53     | 46     | 37     | 51     | 96     | 54     |
| 2     | 13     | 38     | 45     | 84     | 63     | 40     | 1      |
| 3     | 49     | 66     | 71     | 83     | 38     | 18     | 14     |
| 4     | 40     | 26     | 52     | 1      | 87     | 53     | 13     |

A potential fair allocation based on maximizing each agent's highest valuations could be:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 1 (93)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 5 (96)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 3 (84)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 (71)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 4 (87)

Now, we have two items left (0 and 6) and need to allocate them considering the remaining preferences:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 has the next highest valuation (77), but Agent 0 also values it highly (73).
- **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 54, while Agent 0 values it at 24.

To balance the allocations and ensure fairness, let's distribute the remaining items:

- Assign **Item 0** to **Agent 0** (valued at 73, second-highest for Agent 0).
- Assign **Item 6** to **Agent 1** (valued at 54, adding to Agent 1's allocation).

Thus, the final allocations are:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1]
- **Agent 1**: Items [5, 6]
- **Agent 2**: Item [3]
- **Agent 3**: Item [2]
- **Agent 4**: Item [4]

This allocation attempts to be envy-free and respects the highest valuations of each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
