Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  64  49  49  69  63  19
1  50  63  39  78  42  90  20
2  70  60  98  88  28  18  62
3  31  60  99  36  30  50  97
4  57  45  79  71  92  64  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent receives items such that no agent envies another's allocation, or at least to minimize envy.

Let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 351
- Agent 1: 382
- Agent 2: 424
- Agent 3: 403
- Agent 4: 462

Next, we will attempt a fair division by considering the agents' preferences and ensuring each receives a fair share of the total value based on their valuations.

We'll use the following steps to allocate items:

1. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 and 3; we'll allocate those first.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5; allocate that.
3. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 6; allocate that.
4. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 4; allocate that.
5. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1; allocate that.
6. Finally, **Agent 0** also has the highest valuation for item 0; allocate that.

Now, let's distribute the items based on the above reasoning:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable portion of the items based on their valuations, and the number of items sums to 7.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
