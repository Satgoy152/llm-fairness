Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3  90  52  10  36  49  30
1  15  17  22  40  40  22  71
2  93   1  93  70  24  43  43
3  77  42  61  39  17   1  11
4  83  85  40  98  60  27  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible, meaning that no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: Start by identifying which items are highly valued by each agent. This can help in ensuring that each agent gets at least one item they highly value.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on High Valuation**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations to minimize envy.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Once high-value items are allocated, adjust the rest of the allocation to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (value 90) and also values item 2 relatively high (value 52).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most (value 71).
- Agent 2 values items 0 and 2 equally high (value 93).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (value 77).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most (value 98).

Based on these observations, we can make the following allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 2 (values: 90, 52)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6 (value: 71)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (value: 93)
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 4 (value: 17)
- **Agent 4**: Allocate items 3 and 5 (values: 98, 27)

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items and distribute the remaining items to ensure each agent gets a reasonable total value.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 5 agents.
