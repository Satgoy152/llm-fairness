Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  66  50  73   9  22  76
1  25  73  35  79  34  60  60
2  52  23  73  10  46  62  18
3  53  10  88  81  21  27  59
4  82  79  39  16   0  64  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where possible. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own preferences, and they do not envy what another agent has received. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, we'll make an allocation that maximizes each agent's total valuation for their allocated items.

Here's a proposed allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate total valuation for each item across all agents** to identify items that are universally valued highly.
2. **Assign high-value items** based on individual preferences, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
3. **Balance remaining items** to optimize the overall fairness and minimize envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: This item is most valued by agent 4 (82). Assign to agent 4.
2. **Item 1**: This item is highly valued by agent 1 (73). Assign to agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: This item is most valued by agent 3 (88). Assign to agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: This item is most valued by agent 1 (79). Assign to agent 1, as they value it highly and it complements their previous allocation.
5. **Item 4**: This item has the highest value for agent 2 (46). Assign to agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: This item is most valued by agent 2 (62). Assign to agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: This item is most valued by agent 0 (76). Assign to agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their highest preferences where possible, and no agent is left without an item. The allocation follows an envy-free approach as closely as possible under the given constraints.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents in a manner that reflects their preferences as closely as possible.
