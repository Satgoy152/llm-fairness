Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  71  79  85  55  48  15  11
1  10  33  90  21  78   1  82
2  69  44  14  29  51  36  41
3  38   4  81  51  42  20  17
4  11  57  34  91  81  51  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will try to allocate items so that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent values their own allocation. We'll proceed by analyzing the valuations and then allocate the items accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 2 (85). Allocating item 2 to Agent 0 could help satisfy their preferences without causing much envy from others.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 6 (82). Allocating item 6 to Agent 1 seems appropriate given their high valuation for it.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 0 (69). Assigning item 0 to Agent 2 would be beneficial.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 2 (81), but since it has been allocated to Agent 0, we look for the next best option. Item 3 has a reasonable value (51) for them.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 3 (91). Even though item 3 has been allocated to Agent 3, we should consider other high-value items for Agent 4. Item 4 (81) is still available and valuable to Agent 4.

Now, let's look at remaining items and allocate them to balance the distribution while considering the agents' preferences:

- **Item 1**: It is valued moderately by Agent 0 (79), so we will allocate it to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: It has a moderate value (51) for Agent 4, so we can allocate it to Agent 4.

### Final Allocation:

After analyzing and ensuring that the allocations are as fair as possible given the constraints, here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

Each agent is allocated an integer number of items, and all 7 items are distributed among the agents.
