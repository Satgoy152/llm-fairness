Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  28   7  61  55  73  47
1  73  33  13  15  19  41  88
2  82  39  83  92  78  29  26
3  97  89  41  98  81  24  19
4  88  62  91  22  36  28   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 39 83 92 78 29 26]

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, we need to allocate the 7 items (numbered 0 through 6) to the 5 agents (numbered 0 through 4) in such a way that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (93).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the most (88).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (92).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (98).
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the most (91).

2. **Assign Highest Valued Items:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets item 6.
   - Agent 2 gets item 3.
   - Agent 3 cannot get item 3 as it's already assigned, so we assign item 1 (second highest: 89).
   - Agent 4 gets item 2.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items are 4 and 5.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items to Minimize Envy:**
   - Agent 0: Already has item 0.
   - Agent 1: Assign item 5 (41) as it adds value and reduces envy.
   - Agent 2: Already has item 3.
   - Agent 3: Assign item 4 (81) as it adds value.
   - Agent 4: Already has item 2.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
This allocation considers the high-value preferences of each agent and attempts to minimize envy while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed.
