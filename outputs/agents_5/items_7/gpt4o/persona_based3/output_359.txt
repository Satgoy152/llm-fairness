Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  15  64  45  74  41  78
1   6  72  19  81  19  94  39
2  24  59  94  53  95  91  24
3  40  71  97  21  82  86  22
4  75  65  83  47  53  68  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to follow a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here, we will use a method that considers each agent's highest-valued items and attempts to allocate them in a way that minimizes envy.

Let's start by examining the valuations and considering a simple allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 6 (78) and 4 (74).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 5 (94) and 3 (81).
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 (95) highly, followed by item 2 (94).
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 2 (97) and 5 (86).
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 (75) highly, followed by item 2 (83).

We will attempt to allocate the items in a way that respects these preferences while ensuring all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 6 (78) and item 4 (74) due to high valuation.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5 (94) and item 3 (81) due to high valuation.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 (94) due to high valuation.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1 (71) since item 2 is already allocated.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 0 (75).

Now, let's check if all items are allocated:
- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

All items are allocated, and each agent receives items based on their high valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```
