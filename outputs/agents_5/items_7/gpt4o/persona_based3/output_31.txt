Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  81  32  65  64  23  52
1  12   7  75  63  60  11  76
2  28  50  27  99  97   3   5
3  54  12   8  11  50  62   0
4  18  25  26  32  33  73   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation, taking into account their valuations. A common approach in fair division is to use the "maximin" strategy, where we attempt to maximize the minimum value that each agent receives, thus ensuring that no one feels envious of another's allocation.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuation matrix:

```
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0           39  81  32  65  64  23  52
1           12   7  75  63  60  11  76
2           28  50  27  99  97   3   5
3           54  12   8  11  50  62   0
4           18  25  26  32  33  73   3
```

We can implement an allocation strategy by trying to assign items to the agents who value them most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

1. **Allocate Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (value 81).
2. **Allocate Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (value 75).
3. **Allocate Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (value 99).
4. **Allocate Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (value 97).
5. **Allocate Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (value 73).
6. **Allocate Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (value 54).
7. **Allocate Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (value 76).

**Resulting Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Item [1]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 3: Item [0]
- Agent 4: Item [5]

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

The allocations ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 7 items have been allocated as required.
