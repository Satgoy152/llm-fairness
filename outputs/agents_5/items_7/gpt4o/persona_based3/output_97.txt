Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  39  37  56  43  92  32
1  69  90  32  74  45  88  24
2  46  84  75  53  20  33  56
3  65  96  87  78  87  23   3
4  79  89  63  27  59  25  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to satisfy the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Given the valuations, we must carefully distribute the items so that each agent feels satisfied with their share.

To achieve this, we can use a heuristic method to allocate items based on the agents' preferences. One approach is to iteratively assign the most valuable item to the agent who values it the most, then proceed to the next highest-valued item that has not yet been allocated, and repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Let's go through this process:

1. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 values it at 92.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 values it at 78.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

3. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 values it at 96.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

4. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 and Agent 4 both value it at 87.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 to keep allocations balanced.

5. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 4 values it at 79.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

6. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 values it at 87.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 4 values it at 79.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

The allocation results in each agent getting at least one item:

- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 does not get any items.
- Agent 2 does not get any items.
- Agent 3 gets items 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 4 gets items 0 and 6.

This allocation is not perfectly envy-free, but it tries to respect the highest preferences given the competitive valuations. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2, 3, 4],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```
