Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  18  31  97  88  16  50
1  56  10  55  53  92  13  30
2  15  53  31  75  49  48   8
3  90  89  34  48  81  75  51
4  25  13  14  33  41  85  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and that all items must be allocated, we need to balance the allocations to minimize envy and ensure fairness.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 4 and 2.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 4, and 5.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most.

We will try to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items with the highest value are 0 and 3. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the most. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the most, but it's already taken. The next best is item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items 1 and 6 to Agent 3, as these provide a balanced value.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 2 to Agent 4, as it provides a reasonable value.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their value given the constraints, and attempts to minimize envy among agents based on their valuations.
