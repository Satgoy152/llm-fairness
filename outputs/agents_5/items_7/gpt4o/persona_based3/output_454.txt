Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  89  61  71  47  29  18  57
1  10  83  18  25  63   6  38
2  83  58  33  50   3  84  89
3  53  31  34  97  64  15  92
4  41  37  44  28   3  86  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we'll try to ensure that each agent values their allocation as highly as possible given the constraints. We have to allocate a total of 7 items to the 5 agents.

Here's a possible approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the highest (89). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the highest (83). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the highest (89). Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the highest (97). Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 the highest (86). Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

After this initial allocation, items 2 and 4 are left unallocated. We will assign these items by considering the remaining highest preferences:

- **Item 2**: Since it's not allocated, we look at the next highest preferences among all agents. Agent 0 values item 2 the second highest (71), so allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Considering the remaining agents and their preferences, Agent 1 values item 4 the second highest (63) after the already allocated item 1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocations aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations.
