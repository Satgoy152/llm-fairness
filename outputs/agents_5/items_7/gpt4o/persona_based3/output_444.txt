Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  54  72  79  14  49  60
1   4  30  75  55  27  89  32
2  63  42  57   1  86  39  87
3  15  29  12  76  29  87  42
4  24  31  91  96  24  37  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. One approach is to use the method known as "round-robin item allocation" or "sequential allocation". 

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize items that have a high valuation from Agent 0's perspective.
2. **Agent 1**: Select items that Agent 1 values highly, ensuring no envy.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items based on their preferences, checking for envy.
4. **Agent 3**: Do the same for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Finally, allocate to Agent 4 based on their preferences.

Let's proceed with a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 3 (79), 2 (72). Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Highest value items are 5 (89), 2 (75). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 6 (87), 4 (86). Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Highest value items are 5 (87), 3 (76). Item 5 is already allocated, so allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Highest value items are 3 (96), 2 (91). Item 3 is already allocated, so allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (54) as it's the next highest valued remaining item for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 0 (4), which is the only remaining item.

The allocations, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and no item is left unallocated, are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and distribute the items fairly based on the valuations given by each agent.
