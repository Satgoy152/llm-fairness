Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  67  63  77  83  82  63
1  13  58  39  66  79   9  42
2  31  11  82  11  30  98  19
3  15   2  60  90  11  67  20
4  18  93  88  60   1  87  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the matrix of agent valuations for each item, we can attempt to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the total satisfaction across all agents while minimizing envy.

First, let's calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and try to distribute items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

### Valuation Matrix:
```
Agent \ Item | 0  1  2  3  4  5  6
0            | 43 67 63 77 83 82 63
1            | 13 58 39 66 79  9 42
2            | 31 11 82 11 30 98 19
3            | 15  2 60 90 11 67 20
4            | 18 93 88 60  1 87 45
```

### Steps to Allocate Items:
1. **Prioritize Items by Agent Preference**: Each agent should receive items that they value highly.
2. **Avoid Envy**: Ensure no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Values item 4 highly (83) and item 5 (82).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 4 highly (79) and item 3 (66).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highly (98) and item 2 (82).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly (90) and item 5 (67).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 1 highly (93) and item 2 (88).

Based on the values, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** gets items [0, 6] (63, 63)
- **Agent 1** gets items [4] (79)
- **Agent 2** gets items [5] (98)
- **Agent 3** gets items [3] (90)
- **Agent 4** gets items [1, 2] (93, 88)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a share they value significantly, aiming to reduce envy among agents.

### Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, aiming to maximize individual satisfaction and fairness.
