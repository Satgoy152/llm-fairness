Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  46  53  96  91  66   1
1  46  57  61  99  13  21  14
2  73  28  56  17  60  25  93
3  73  85  90  95  64  50  85
4  89  51  88   9  16  58  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent gets an integer number of items, we can employ the concept of envy-freeness, which seeks to allocate items so that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations:

|       | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Agent 0 | 46 | 46 | 53 | 96 | 91 | 66 | 1  |
| Agent 1 | 46 | 57 | 61 | 99 | 13 | 21 | 14 |
| Agent 2 | 73 | 28 | 56 | 17 | 60 | 25 | 93 |
| Agent 3 | 73 | 85 | 90 | 95 | 64 | 50 | 85 |
| Agent 4 | 89 | 51 | 88 | 9  | 16 | 58 | 36 |

One way to achieve a fair allocation is to try to give each agent their highest valued items while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

After considering the valuations, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (96), followed by item 4 (91).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (99).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (73), followed by item 6 (93).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (90), followed by item 3 (95) and item 1 (85).
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (89), followed by item 2 (88).

Now, we assign items based on these preferences while considering each agent can receive only an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

### Proposed Allocation:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0, 6]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [1, 5]

This allocation gives each agent at least one item they highly value and ensures all items are distributed.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
