Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  57  32  54  65  61  51
1  17  56  49  90  88  35  52
2  37  33  77  26   8  98  70
3  69  78  48  46  12  53  72
4  31  68   7  88  80  76  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to minimize envy and ensure that each agent values their allocated items as fairly as possible. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. However, since we have 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will end up with fewer items than others.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (value 98), so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 3 (value 90), so we allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 5 (value 98), so we allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1 (value 78), so we allocate item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 6 (value 81), so we allocate item 6 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (items 2 and 4) to minimize envy.

6. Agent 2 highly values item 2 (value 77), so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
7. Agent 1 highly values item 4 (value 88), so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing the items as evenly as possible. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated.
