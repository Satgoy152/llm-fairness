Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  47   9  46  93  51  87
1  90   4   6  55  22  48  79
2  22  22  76  50  55   3  12
3  51  46  93  10   3  34  29
4  38  16  86  14  64  85  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where possible, respecting each agent's preferences and ensuring each agent receives at least one item (if possible). Let's consider the valuations and create an allocation plan:

First, we note that there are 7 items and 5 agents. Hence, some agents will get more than one item.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - High valuation for item 4 (93).
   - Allocation: Item 4.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuation for item 0 (90).
   - Allocation: Item 0.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuation for item 2 (76).
   - Allocation: Item 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - High valuation for item 2 (93), but it's already taken by Agent 2. Next preference is item 0 (51), but it's taken by Agent 1. Then, item 1 (46).
   - Allocation: Item 1.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - High valuation for item 6 (94).
   - Allocation: Item 6.

### Remaining Items:

Items 3 and 5 are unallocated.

6. **Reallocate remaining items based on secondary preferences:**
   - **Agent 0:** Next high preference is item 3 (46), not very high but second best after item 4.
   - **Agent 1:** Next high preference is item 5 (48).
   - Allocation:
     - Agent 0: Item 3.
     - Agent 1: Item 5.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and we aim to minimize envy by considering both the highest and secondary preferences where possible.
