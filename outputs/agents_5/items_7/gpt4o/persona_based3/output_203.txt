Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  69  96  18  86  91   4
1  25  32  32   7  25  71  22
2  42  62  30  18  64  10   3
3  86  14  59  83  78  34  79
4  87  76  78  65  52  26  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, considering the valuations provided, we will use the concept of envy-freeness and attempt to balance the perceived value each agent receives. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations.

The strategy involves:
1. Assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's perceived value.
2. Ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
3. Ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items by considering the highest value first. Item 2 has the highest value for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate the item with the highest value that hasn't been allocated yet. Item 5 fits best here.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 1, as it's the highest value available for them.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 4, which is highly valued by agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 3, as it has a reasonably high value for them.
6. Distribute remaining items (0 and 6) to ensure all items are allocated. Assign item 0 to agent 0 and item 6 to agent 3 based on relative value preferences.

The result is an allocation that aims for envy-freeness by maximizing each agent's total perceived value.
