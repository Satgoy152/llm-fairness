Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  98  63  55  14  55  43
1  63  24  60  77  45  71  87
2  53  14  34  91  50  40  75
3  98  66   6   9   5  13  18
4  30  57  72  64   0  96  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is both envy-free and fair. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their valuations. Given the valuations provided, I will attempt to distribute the items to minimize envy and maximize fairness.

Here is the allocation strategy taking into account the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the highest. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the highest. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 the highest. Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Re-evaluate remaining items based on the next highest valuations and attempt to balance:

6. Assign item 2 (valued 63) to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values it second highest among unallocated items and had no other allocations yet.
7. Assign item 4 (valued 45) to Agent 1, as it is their next highest available.

This results in each agent receiving at least one item, and the allocation minimizes potential envy given the constraints.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
