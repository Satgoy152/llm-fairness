Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  86  62  53  26  95   3
1  41  44  28  55  12  35  42
2  87  80  16   8  89  70  75
3  73  14  43  95  11  33  24
4  61  86  69  58   9   1  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 7 items among the 5 agents, we aim to respect the principles of fair division, particularly ensuring that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

The table of valuations is as follows:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  86  62  53  26  95   3
1  41  44  28  55  12  35  42
2  87  80  16   8  89  70  75
3  73  14  43  95  11  33  24
4  61  86  69  58   9   1  14
```

To start the allocation process, we identify the items most preferred by each agent:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (95).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (55).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (87).
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (95), but since it's already chosen by Agent 1, we look at the next highest, which is item 0 (73), but it's also chosen by Agent 2, so we go to the next, item 2 (43).
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (86).

We'll allocate these highest preference items first, resolving conflicts by choosing the next best available item for each agent. We can then distribute the remaining items.

After initial allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets item 2.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.

Items allocated so far: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5.

Remaining items: 4, 6.

Distribute the remaining items to agents who have less favorable allocations or fewer items:

- Give item 4 to Agent 2 (as Agent 2 values item 4 highly at 89, their next best).
- Give item 6 to Agent 1 (as Agent 1 values item 6 at 42, their next best).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [3, 6]
- Agent 2: [0, 4]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [1]

This allocation strives to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
