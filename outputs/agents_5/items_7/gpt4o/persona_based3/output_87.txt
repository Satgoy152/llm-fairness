Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64   2  83  37  31  58   7
1  59   6  78   7  76   2   2
2  24   0  84  54  18  21  70
3  55   4  26  53  42  78   4
4  89  57  96  13  44  27  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, one approach is to use an algorithm that attempts to minimize envy, such as the Adjusted Winner procedure or similar heuristic methods. However, given the need to assign exactly 7 items among 5 agents, and the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, we need to consider how to best distribute the items.

Let's consider a simple heuristic method to achieve a relatively fair distribution:

1. Start by allocating items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that no agent receives more than one item until all have at least one (if possible).
2. Continue allocating any remaining items by comparing the remaining unallocated items to the agents' preferences and distributing them to minimize envy.

Following this process for the given table, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Valuation is highest for item 2 (83).
- **Agent 1**: Valuation is highest for item 4 (76).
- **Agent 2**: Valuation is highest for item 2 (84), but since item 2 is already allocated, choose the next highest, item 6 (70).
- **Agent 3**: Valuation is highest for item 5 (78).
- **Agent 4**: Valuation is highest for item 2 (96), but since item 2 is already allocated, choose the next highest, item 0 (89).

Since items 0, 4, 5, and 6 are allocated but not item 3, we need to proceed carefully to allocate the remaining items (1, 3) to ensure all agents receive at least one item:

- **Agent 1**, who has only received one item and has a valuation of 7 for item 3, can receive item 3.
- **Agent 3**, who has only received one item and has a valuation of 4 for item 1, can receive item 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable allocation based on their highest preferences, and all items are allocated.
