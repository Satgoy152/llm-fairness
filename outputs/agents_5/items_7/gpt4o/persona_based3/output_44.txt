Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  90  45  84  91  39  15  42
1  52  92  84  11   3  77  84
2  47  58  81  97  42  97  24
3  42   3  54  79  92  54   6
4  86   7  58  66  11  21  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences and the total value they perceive. A common approach is to use techniques from fair division, such as the envy-free criterion, where each agent should ideally feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation in terms of their own valuation.

Here's a possible allocation that attempts to balance the perceived values:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 3 (value of 91) and item 0 (value of 90). They should receive these two items.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 1 (value of 92) and item 6 (value of 84). They should receive these two items.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 5 (value of 97) and item 3 (value of 97). However, item 3 is already taken by agent 0. So, they can receive item 5 and item 2 (value of 81).
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 4 (value of 92). They should receive this item.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent can receive item 6 (value of 42) since they have lower valuations compared to other agents.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to respect the agents' valuations in a fair manner.
