Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  62  22   2  38  27  20  85
1  30  22  99  64  41  29  58
2  35  56  26  66   0  45  49
3  69   8  49  60  97  30  20
4  92  87  57  12  44  43   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 56 26 66  0 45 49]
 [69  8 49 60 97 30 20]
 [92 87 57 12 44 43  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to consider each agent's preferences and try to achieve a fair division that minimizes envy. Let's evaluate the valuations for each item across all agents and attempt to fairly distribute them.

Here are the valuations for each item by each agent:

- **Item 0**: [62, 30, 35, 69, 92]
- **Item 1**: [22, 22, 56, 8, 87]
- **Item 2**: [2, 99, 26, 49, 57]
- **Item 3**: [38, 64, 66, 60, 12]
- **Item 4**: [27, 41, 0, 97, 44]
- **Item 5**: [20, 29, 45, 30, 43]
- **Item 6**: [85, 58, 49, 20, 9]

We will try to assign items in such a way that each agent receives items that they value highly, minimizing the chances of envy.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Highest value: Item 6 (85)
  - Next highest value: Item 0 (62)
  
- **Agent 1**:
  - Highest value: Item 2 (99)
  
- **Agent 2**:
  - Highest value: Item 3 (66)
  - Next highest value: Item 5 (45)
  
- **Agent 3**:
  - Highest value: Item 4 (97)
  
- **Agent 4**:
  - Highest value: Item 1 (87)

### Assigning Items:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives items 6 and 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Receives items 3 and 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Receives item 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least some items that they value relatively highly, attempting to minimize overall envy.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items to the agents while considering their preferences, aiming for a fair distribution.
