Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  48  87  12  54  93  66  60
1  75  88  34  29  58  70  87
2  83  56  23  29  37   1  32
3  25  26  17  81  41  92  75
4  45  51  84  24  85  80  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method called the "round-robin" allocation. This method involves iterating over the items and assigning each to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Determine the total number of items each agent should receive. Since there are 7 items and 5 agents, we can initially give each agent 1 item, and then distribute the remaining 2 items to the agents with the largest unallocated values.

2. Allocate one item to each agent based on their highest valuation that hasn't been assigned yet.

3. Allocate the remaining items to maximize individual happiness (envy-freeness) while ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (value: 93)
- Agent 1 gets item 6 (value: 87)
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value: 83)
- Agent 3 gets item 5 (value: 92)
- Agent 4 gets item 2 (value: 84)

Now, two items remain (1 and 3). We distribute these based on the remaining highest valuations:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (value: 87)
- Agent 3 gets item 3 (value: 81)

This results in the following fairly distributed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent receives an integer number of items and maximizes their individual happiness based on their valuations.
