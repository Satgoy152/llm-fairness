Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  73  73   5  60  83  76
1  14  35  84  45  38  45  24
2  46  33  65   5  76  36  62
3  46  47   6   8  52  95   9
4  51  10  45  76  57  63  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to minimize envy, where each agent should believe they received a fair share of the items based on their personal valuations. One common method to achieve this is the "Envy-Free" allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

In this case, we have 5 agents and 7 items, and each agent's preference for each item is given in the table. The goal is to allocate all items so that fairness is achieved. Here's one possible approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Analysis**: We examine the valuations matrix to identify items that hold significant value for particular agents. We look for high-value items for each agent to ensure they receive items they value highly.

2. **Fair Allocation Strategy**: We'll use a heuristic approach to distribute items so that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, while keeping the distribution as fair as possible across all agents.

After analyzing the table and considering the constraints, here's a fair allocation of the items:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 5 highly, so let's allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 2 highly, allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 highly, allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 5 highly, but since it's already allocated, we'll allocate item 1 which they also value.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 3 highly, allocate item 3 to agent 4.

Now we need to distribute the remaining items (0 and 6):

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 is highly valued by agent 0, so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- **Agent 2**: Item 6 is the next best for agent 2, allocate item 6 to agent 2.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences and ensures that all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their valuations, promoting fairness and minimizing envy.
