Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  95  45  89  30   3   5  51
1   2  17  94  24  33  50  27
2  61  95  10  48  31  49  28
3  65  12  81  71  88  15  43
4  66  19  38  31  78  39  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 12 81 71 88 15 43]
 [66 19 38 31 78 39 97]]
Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent, according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6
    0  95  45  89  30   3   5  51
    1   2  17  94  24  33  50  27
    2  61  95  10  48  31  49  28
    3  65  12  81  71  88  15  43
    4  66  19  38  31  78  39  97
```

We will use the following approach to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items to minimize envy.
3. Ensure each item is allocated to only one agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the highest.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 the highest.

Now, allocate these items:

- Agent 0 is allocated item 0.
- Agent 1 is allocated item 2.
- Agent 2 is allocated item 1.
- Agent 3 is allocated item 4.
- Agent 4 is allocated item 6.

The remaining unallocated items are 3 and 5. We will allocate these to further balance the satisfaction.

- Agent 3 has a relatively high value for item 3.
- Agent 2 has a relatively high value for item 5.

Thus, allocate:

- Agent 3 is also allocated item 3.
- Agent 2 is also allocated item 5.

The allocations ensure each agent gets at least one item, minimizing potential envy based on their highest valued items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [6]
}
```
