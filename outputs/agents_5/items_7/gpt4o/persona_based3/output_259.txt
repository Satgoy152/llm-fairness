Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  87  53  42  56  38   1
1  29  68  65  74  20  91  68
2  52  70  65  54  82  36  49
3  58  91  76   6  23   2  43
4  21  28  62   3  74  17  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider a fair division approach that minimizes envy. One possible approach to achieve envy-freeness (or at least minimize envy) is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most preferred available item.

Given the valuations, we can derive a fair allocation as follows:

1. **Agent Priorities**: First, we determine the order in which agents will pick items. In this case, let's proceed with a simple order: Agent 0, Agent 1, Agent 2, Agent 3, and Agent 4.

2. **Allocation Process**:
   - **Round 1**:
     1. Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 93).
     2. Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 91).
     3. Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 82).
     4. Agent 3 picks item 1 (value 91).
     5. Agent 4 picks item 2 (value 62).

   - **Round 2**:
     1. Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 42).
     2. Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 68).

   All items have now been allocated.

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 3
   - Agent 1: Items 5, 6
   - Agent 2: Item 4
   - Agent 3: Item 1
   - Agent 4: Item 2

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and we attempt to minimize envy by allowing agents to pick their highest-valued available item in their turn.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
