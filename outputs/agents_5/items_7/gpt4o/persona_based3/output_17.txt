Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  81  13  75  26  16  96  80
1  73  42   2  11   3  13   4
2  39  73   1  34   0   7  85
3  74  98  76  52   3  15  35
4  47  98  15  63  71  37   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and considers the preferences of each agent based on their valuations. One potential approach is to maximize each agent's total value from the items they receive. Given the data, we'll attempt an allocation that ensures each agent feels they're getting a fair share, relative to their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, 5, and 6, so they should receive a combination of these.
- **Agent 1** has a significant valuation for item 0, but since Agent 0 values it more, we'll consider other allocations. Items 1 and 5 provide reasonable value.
- **Agent 2** values item 6 the most, so we'll allocate this to them. 
- **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 1 and 2, so these should be prioritized for them.
- **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 1 and 3, so item 3 can be allocated to them, given items 1 and 2 may be allocated to others.

To ensure all items are allocated and the distribution is as fair as possible, given these preferences, here's a proposed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5, which are valued highly by them.
- Agent 1 receives item 4, which is not highly valued by others.
- Agent 2 receives item 6, which they value the most.
- Agent 3 receives items 1 and 2, which are among the highest in their valuation.
- Agent 4 receives item 3, which is one of their higher-valued items. 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are highly valued by them, leading to a fair distribution with minimal envy.
