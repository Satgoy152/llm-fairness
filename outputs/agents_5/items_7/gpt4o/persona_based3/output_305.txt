Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  71  85  18  36  21  87
1  34  62  78   8  87  32  40
2  15  64  88  90  40  17  89
3  27  13  68   5  22  42  77
4  55  66  10  61  77  52  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation is as close to their preferences as possible. Given that there are 7 items and 5 agents, each agent may not receive the same number of items, but we will aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible.

One method to achieve this is to use a round-robin approach based on each agent's highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet. This approach aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocated items.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as it is their highest-valued item.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as it is their highest-valued item.
3. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as it is their highest-valued item.
4. Assign item 6 to agent 3, as it is their highest-valued item.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 4, as it is their highest-valued item.

Now we have 2 items left (2 and 5) to allocate. We continue the round-robin approach:

6. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as it is still available and highly valued by them.
7. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as it is the next available item and highly valued by them.

This allocation aims to balance the agents' preferences while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [6, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
