Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  79   1  67   9   8  42
1  36  54  75  83  86  87  34
2  14  10  78  22  65  27  10
3  56  50  16  19  97  11  27
4  93  67   3  99  85  27  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, one approach is to use algorithms like the adjusted winner procedure or the maximum Nash welfare solution. However, given the discrete and small nature of this problem, a heuristic approach can quickly lead to a reasonably fair distribution.

Here, I'll use a simple heuristic based on maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that the distribution is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means that no agent should feel they would be better off with the items allocated to another agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Start by identifying the highest valuation each agent has across all items and try to allocate those items to the respective agents.

2. **Distribute Remaining Items**: After the initial allocation, distribute the remaining items to the agents based on their valuations while ensuring that no one agent ends up with significantly more value than others.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: Ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. If necessary, reallocate items to minimize envy.

### Allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest, followed by item 0. Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest. Allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest. Allocate item 4 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest. Allocate item 3 to agent 4.

Now, items 0 and 6 remain unallocated. Distribute these remaining items considering the current distribution:

6. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, as it is their second highest valuation.
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 4, as it is their second highest valuation after 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of their highest-valued items, and the remaining items are allocated to balance the valuations as much as possible.

### Resulting Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their items while maintaining a degree of fairness across the board.
