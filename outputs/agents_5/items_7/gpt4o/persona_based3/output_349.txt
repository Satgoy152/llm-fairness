Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  50  28  47  82  32  41  92
1   6   1  74  85  86  19  20
2  22  97  13  26  56  10  73
3  71  52  93  43  79  48  46
4  27  15  99  98  62  85  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should be at least as happy with their allocation as they are with any other agent's allocation. Given the agents' valuations of each item, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent would prefer another agent's bundle over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to distribute the items accordingly. Since there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will end up with more items than others. We'll try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes total valuation while aiming for a fair distribution.

Let's allocate the items using a simple greedy algorithm that considers each agent's highest-valued available item:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 6 (92), 3 (82)
   - Allocation: [6, 3]
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 4 (86), 3 (85)
   - Allocation: [4]
   - (Item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 1 (97), 6 (73)
   - Allocation: [1]
   - (Item 6 is already allocated to Agent 0)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (93)
   - Allocation: [2]

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value items: 2 (99), 3 (98), 5 (85)
   - Allocation: [5]
   - (Items 2 and 3 are already allocated)

Now, let's check if all items are allocated and adjust if necessary:

- **Unallocated items**: 0

We can allocate item 0 to Agent 1 to balance the distribution.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocations are done by maximizing individual agent satisfaction based on their preferences.
