Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  94  42  39  41   5  14   4
1  69  69  74  45  74  81  47
2  82  47  97  63   6  24  44
3  34  63  38  81  37  94  89
4  77  23   9  82  51  60  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness.

First, let's examine some possible allocations that aim to balance the total value received by each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Focus on items with higher valuations for Agent 0, such as item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Target items with higher valuations for Agent 1, such as items 4 and 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize items with higher valuations for Agent 2, such as item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Look at items with higher valuations for Agent 3, such as item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Consider items with higher valuations for Agent 4, such as item 3.

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 94 to Agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Items 4 and 5 (values 74 and 81 to Agent 1, respectively).
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (value 97 to Agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (value 89 to Agent 3).
- **Agent 4**: Items 1 and 3 (values 23 and 82 to Agent 4, respectively).

This allocation tries to give each agent items that they value highly:

- Agent 0 gets item 0, which they value the most.
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 5, both of which have high values for them.
- Agent 2 receives item 2, the highest valued item for them.
- Agent 3 receives item 6, which is highly valued by them.
- Agent 4 receives items 1 and 3, with item 3 being highly valued by them.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items they value highly, aiming for a fair and envy-free distribution.
