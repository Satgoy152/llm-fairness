Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13  24  18  35   2  71  31
1  56  26  28  76  80   7  78
2  74   5  93  98  38  94  62
3  19  17  62  66  52  82  63
4  42  70  81  40   5  99  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One common approach is to use the "maximum envy-free allocation" method, which seeks to minimize envy across all agents by maximizing each agent's value for their allocated items.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuation for item 5 (71). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuation for item 4 (80). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuation for item 3 (98). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuation for item 5 (82), but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 6 (63). Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuation for item 5 (99), but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 6 (94), but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 2 (81). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, items 0 and 1 are left. We will assign them to the agents based on their remaining highest valuations:

6. **Agent 0:** Highest remaining is item 1 (24). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 4:** Highest remaining is item 0 (42). Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Let's put this into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their utility based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
