Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  76  14  19  70  78  13
1   5  41  88  99  74  45  62
2  42  26  63  80  49  83   5
3  71  24  39   2  43  99  12
4  13  53  78  56  25  66  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while attempting to minimize envy, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which aims to maximize the product of utilities, thereby ensuring a fair allocation. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Identify total items and agents**: We have 7 items and 5 agents.
2. **Objective**: Allocate items to agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
3. **Maximize fairness**: We aim to allocate in a way that is envy-free or as close as possible, meaning each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Has relatively high values for items 1 and 5. Allocating items 1 and 5 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the most. Allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highly, but it is already allocated. Next highest is item 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the highest. Allocate item 0 to agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 2 highly, but it is allocated. Next is item 6. Allocate item 6 to agent 4.

Now, let's review unallocated items: Item 4 remains unallocated.

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 1 values item 4 highly (74), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is distributed, trying to balance value perceived by each agent according to their preferences.
