Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  46  32  47  59  85  18
1  49  98  86  59  32   6  20
2  16  22  12   8   3   8  88
3  29  83   8  90  32  15  90
4  64  57  70  51   1  23  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. This is a complex problem, but we can attempt a reasonable allocation using a heuristic approach.

First, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (85).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (98).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (88).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (90).
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most (70).

We will start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item, if possible, and then allocate remaining items considering the next highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. Assign each agent their top-valued item:
   - Agent 0 gets item 5.
   - Agent 1 gets item 1.
   - Agent 2 gets item 6.
   - Agent 3 gets item 3.
   - Agent 4 gets item 2.

2. Remaining items: [0, 4]

3. Allocate remaining items considering the next highest preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

   - Item 0:
     - Preferred by Agent 4 (64) over others.
     - Allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

   - Item 4:
     - Remaining agents: 0, 1, 2, 3
     - Preferred by Agent 0 (59) over others.
     - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [1]
- Agent 2: Items [6]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [2, 0]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 0]
}
```
