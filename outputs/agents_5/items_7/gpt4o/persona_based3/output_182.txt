Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  22  33  63  66  42  81   8
1  13  15  34  81  59  16  91
2  32  12  55  75  67  33  16
3  66   9  49  17  94  98  76
4  47  50  60  79  82  75  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation while considering envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. In this context, we aim to find a distribution where each agent perceives their allocation as valuable as possible, given the constraints.

One possible method to approach this problem is to use the "round-robin" allocation where each agent takes turns picking their most preferred available item until all items are allocated. Another approach could be optimizing for maximizing the minimum value of the allocations, but for simplicity, we'll apply a straightforward method to ensure each agent gets at least one item and the total number of allocated items is seven.

Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 5 (81).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 6 (91).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 3 (75).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 5 (98), but already taken, so item 4 (94) is next.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is item 4 (82), but already taken, so item 3 (79) is next.

At this point, each agent has received one item. Now, we allocate the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0**: Next highest remaining item is item 3 (66), already taken, so item 2 (63).
7. **Agent 1**: Next highest remaining item is item 4 (59), already taken, so item 0 (13).

The allocations can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is seven.
