Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  84  74  95  98  38  17  75
1  31  57   7  98  81  96  84
2  50  54  73  46   4  10  45
3  44  25  62  18  83  49  97
4  25  49  44  66  51  36  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for every item. Our goal is to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures a fair distribution given the preferences.

Here is one approach to allocate the items based on the provided valuations:

1. **Highest Valuation Strategy**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. This strategy tends to minimize envy because each agent gets the items they value highly.

Letâ€™s evaluate the preferences and allocate accordingly:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 84 (highest valuation).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 74 (highest valuation).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 95 (highest valuation).
- Item 3: Agents 0 and 1 value it at 98. Since Agent 0 already has 3 high-value items, allocate this to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it at 83 (highest valuation).
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it at 96 (highest valuation).
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it at 97 (highest valuation).

This allocation strategy ensures that each item is given to an agent who values it highly, thereby minimizing envy.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": []
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 2.
- Agent 1 receives items 3 and 5.
- Agent 3 receives items 4 and 6.
- Agents 2 and 4 receive no items, as their valuations do not surpass those of other agents for the given items. 

This allocation respects the condition of only allocating items to the agents listed in the table, and all 7 items are allocated.
