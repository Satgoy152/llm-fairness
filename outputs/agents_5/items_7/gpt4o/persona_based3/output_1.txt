Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  39  60  48  86  67  51  88
1  25  53  19  31  31  34  92
2  73  46   9  11  70  17  42
3  22  37  56  81   2   6  36
4  35  66  41  82  16  92  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to minimize envy among the agents and ensure that each agent is satisfied with the allocation they receive. One way to approach this problem is to use the Envy-Free Matching algorithm or similar techniques to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations. Here's one possible solution:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 highly (88), so we can assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest (92), but it has already been allocated. The next highest value is item 1 (53), which is unallocated.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 highly (73), so we can assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly (81), so we can assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 highly (92), so we can assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we have assigned items 6, 1, 0, 3, and 5. We need to allocate the remaining items 2 and 4.

6. **Agent 0** also has a high valuation for item 4 (67), and since it is unallocated, we can assign item 4 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 3** values item 2 (56) more than other unallocated items, so we can assign item 2 to Agent 3.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy and ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
