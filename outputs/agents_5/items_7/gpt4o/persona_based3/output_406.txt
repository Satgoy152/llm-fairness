Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  10  37  39  35  68  63  19
1  12  47  24  68   9  69  79
2  71  27  33  90  34  98  51
3  54  98   8  71  12  19  26
4  51  43  76  68  40  81  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations, and no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate items to agents while minimizing envy. Here is the plan:

1. **Agent 0**: They have high valuations for items 4 (68) and 5 (63). Allocating item 4 to Agent 0 seems reasonable.
2. **Agent 1**: They highly value item 6 (79). Allocating item 6 to Agent 1 would satisfy their high valuation.
3. **Agent 2**: They place high value on item 5 (98). Allocating item 5 to Agent 2 would be a good choice.
4. **Agent 3**: They highly value item 1 (98). Allocating item 1 to Agent 3 would meet their preference.
5. **Agent 4**: They have the highest valuation for item 2 (76). Allocating item 2 to Agent 4 is appropriate.

Now, we have allocated five items (0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6) to the agents. We need to allocate the remaining items (0 and 3) to complete the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 also has a high valuation for this item (71). Allocating item 0 to Agent 2 would maintain a fair distribution.
- **Item 3**: Agent 4 values this item (68), which is consistent with their other high valuations. Allocating item 3 to Agent 4 would be suitable.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```
