Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  42  87  36  50  65  79
1  48  11  98  70  60  84  87
2  47  58  64  76  87  37  78
3  94  94  76  88  51  61   0
4  11  32   0  38  76  47   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and try to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. One possible approach is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum envy or minimizing the maximum envy, ensuring that each agent is as satisfied as possible given the constraints.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [30, 42, 87, 36, 50, 65, 79]
Agent 1: [48, 11, 98, 70, 60, 84, 87]
Agent 2: [47, 58, 64, 76, 87, 37, 78]
Agent 3: [94, 94, 76, 88, 51, 61, 0]
Agent 4: [11, 32, 0, 38, 76, 47, 2]
```

A potential fair allocation strategy could involve the following steps:

1. **Maximize Individual Happiness:** Allocate items based on each agent's highest valuation first, ensuring no conflicts arise.
2. **Balance Remaining Items:** For items not clearly preferred by any single agent, distribute them to balance total satisfaction across agents.
3. **Check for Envy-Freeness:** Adjust allocations if possible to reduce envy, where one agent prefers another's allocation to their own.

Given these steps, let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 2, so they get item 2.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 2, but it is already allocated. Next high value is item 5, so they get item 5.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 4, so they get item 4.
- **Agent 3** highly values items 0 and 1 equally, give them item 0.
- **Agent 4** doesn't have a high preference, but they get item 3 due to moderate value.

Now let's allocate the remaining items 1 and 6:

- **Item 1**: Give this to Agent 3, as they have the highest secondary preference.
- **Item 6**: Give this to Agent 1, as they have the highest remaining preference.

Resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation seeks to ensure each agent receives items that maximize their preferences while distributing the total value fairly across agents.
