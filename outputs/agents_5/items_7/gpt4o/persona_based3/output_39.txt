Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  16  67  64  84  72  74  84
1  30  85  95   3  21   1  65
2   5  79  58  78  37  24  85
3  74  51  96  81  12  71  52
4  39  65  68  24  53   1  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility for each agent while ensuring no one envies another's allocation. Given the valuations provided in the table, we aim to distribute items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation, considering their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values items 3 and 6 highly (84 each). Allocating these two items to Agent 0 will maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (95). Allocating item 2 to Agent 1 will maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 6 (85) the highest, but it is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 (79). Allocating item 1 to Agent 2 will maximize their satisfaction.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Agent 3 values item 2 (96) the highest, but it is already allocated to Agent 1. The next highest value for Agent 3 is item 0 (74). Allocating item 0 to Agent 3 will maximize their satisfaction.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Agent 4 values item 6 (90) the highest, but it is already allocated to Agent 0. The next highest values for Agent 4 are item 2 (68) and item 0 (39), but item 2 is allocated to Agent 1 and item 0 to Agent 3. Therefore, we allocate item 4 (53) to Agent 4.

After allocating the above items, we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate 1 more item, item 5, which hasn't been assigned yet. We will assign it to the agent who values it the most among those who have received fewer items.

- **Item 5**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 74, Agent 1 at 1, Agent 2 at 24, Agent 3 at 71, and Agent 4 at 1.
  - Agent 0 values it the highest and can have an additional item since it optimizes their valuation.

Let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items maximizing their valuation while ensuring all items are allocated.
