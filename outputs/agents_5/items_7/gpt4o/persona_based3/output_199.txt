Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  50  50  55  18   4  75
1  96  92  90  42  73  91  50
2  95  57   2  88  69  58  42
3  31  12  14  62  67  86  84
4  73  51  26  80  91  42  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated, let's proceed with a fair division approach considering the valuations provided.

First, let's analyze some potential strategies:

1. **Maximizing individual happiness:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Minimizing envy:** Try to balance the total value each agent receives to minimize envy.

We'll begin by examining the highest valuations for each item and assign accordingly, then adjust to ensure each agent has at least one item if possible and minimize envy.

- **Item 0:** Highest value is 96 by agent 1.
- **Item 1:** Highest value is 92 by agent 1.
- **Item 2:** Highest value is 90 by agent 1.
- **Item 3:** Highest value is 88 by agent 2.
- **Item 4:** Highest value is 91 by agent 4.
- **Item 5:** Highest value is 91 by agent 1.
- **Item 6:** Highest value is 89 by agent 4.

Initial allocation based on highest values:
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 5]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 4: [4, 6]

Now let's adjust to ensure all agents receive items, and the allocation does not create significant envy:

Reallocate considering balance and integer constraints:
- Agent 0: [0] (removes item 0 from Agent 1, fair trade-off with items 1 and 2)
- Agent 1: [1, 2, 5] (keeps the highest values they initially had)
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [5] (removes item 5 from Agent 1, provides item 5 to an agent without items)
- Agent 4: [4, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and tries to balance satisfaction across agents.

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
