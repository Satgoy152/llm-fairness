Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  30  93   6  11  41  61
1  91  59  56  49  63  38  66
2   0  25  96  73   9  19  44
3  49  37  64  55  41  33  44
4  22   4  80  92  23   4  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a method similar to the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or "Round Robin" method. However, given the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items, we'll focus on an allocation that seeks to balance the overall perceived value for each agent.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value preferences for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (93).
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (91).
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (96).
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2 (64).
   - Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3 (92).

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations:**
   - Start with the highest unique valuations for each item.
   - Since item 2 is valued highly by multiple agents, allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation (Agent 2).

3. **Allocate remaining items considering fairness:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as it's their highest preference.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4, as it's their highest preference.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it's their next highest preference.
   - Allocate items 5 and 6 to Agent 3, leaving them with a fair distribution.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as they still have a relatively high valuation for it compared to others.

### Final Allocation:

This allocation aims to balance the total value perceived by each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. 

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and while not perfectly envy-free due to the constraint of integer allocations, it tries to balance the perceived value each agent receives based on their preferences.
