Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  53  66  48  46  78  96
1  63  72  12  38  71  27  81
2  36  39  64  13  55  96  64
3   3  90  95  73   9  55  95
4  78  19   7  56  84  69   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 3 90 95 73  9 55 95]
 [78 19  7 56 84 69  4]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to make sure that each agent receives items such that no agent envies another for their allocated bundle. This involves considering the valuations each agent assigns to each item and trying to distribute the items to maximize fairness and minimize envy.

Let's examine the valuations matrix:

```
Agent \ Item:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0              60  53  66  48  46  78  96
1              63  72  12  38  71  27  81
2              36  39  64  13  55  96  64
3               3  90  95  73   9  55  95
4              78  19   7  56  84  69   4
```

We will use the following strategy to allocate items:
1. Each agent should ideally be allocated the items that they value the most compared to others.
2. Ensure that the allocations are fair by balancing the overall value each agent receives.

Based on the valuations provided, a possible fair allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 6 (value 96) because it's their highest valued item.
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 71) because it's one of their highest valued items, and item 3 (value 38) since the other agents have a lower valuation for this item.
- Agent 2 gets item 5 (value 96) because it's their highest valued item.
- Agent 3 gets item 2 (value 95) because it's their highest valued item and item 1 (value 90) since it's highly valued by them.
- Agent 4 gets item 0 (value 78) because it's their highest valued item.

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by assigning each agent items they value highly while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
