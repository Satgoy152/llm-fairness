Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  18  25   3  21  90  90
1  30  60  87  91   4  51  85
2  26  85  25  29   1  74  81
3  38  80  66   2  73  27  96
4   4  42   8  37  17  45   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy among agents, such as the Envy-Free up to One Item (EF1) criterion. EF1 allows for allocations where any envy an agent might have towards another can be eliminated by removing at most one item from the envied agent's bundle.

Given the valuations, let's consider an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 5 (90) and item 6 (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 3 (91).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 1 (85).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 6 (96).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 5 (45).

Let's try to allocate items by considering each agent's most valued items while ensuring no agent has excessive envy. We will aim for an allocation that respects the EF1 condition:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 2]
- **Agent 1**: [3]
- **Agent 2**: [1]
- **Agent 3**: [6]
- **Agent 4**: [4, 5]

Here, each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation tries to respect their preferences as much as possible. 

Thus, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
