Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  32  12  50  36  74  14
1  72  16  42   1  53  17  73
2  74  31  69  95  52  59  97
3  92  47  99  75  84  90  57
4  24  34  11   8  99  91  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, considering each agent's valuations. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that each agent values their bundle as much as possible while ensuring fairness.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 3** has a very high valuation for item 2 (99), which is the highest individual valuation for any item. Allocating item 2 to agent 3 maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 3 (95) and 6 (97). Allocating these to agent 2 makes efficient use of their preferences.

3. **Agent 4** highly values item 4 (99). Assigning item 4 to agent 4 ensures they are satisfied.

4. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (77) and 5 (74). Assigning these to agent 0 maximizes their utility.

5. **Agent 1** is left with item 1 (16), which ensures all items are allocated.

Now, let's ensure this distribution satisfies our constraints:

- Each agent has an integer number of items.
- All 7 items have been allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation seeks to provide each agent with items they value highly, minimizing envy while ensuring all items are distributed.
