Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  19  63  70  53  81  67
1  76  98  86  44   9  39  93
2  56  92  99  41  23  84  44
3  31  82  61  85  44  74  15
4   4   4  97  70  77  14  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 7 items among 5 agents in a manner that ensures fairness, ideally avoiding envy. One approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each item is allocated exactly once.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item:** For each item, find which agent values it the most and attempt to allocate that item to that agent.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
   - Ensure each agent receives at least some allocation if possible.
   - Prioritize reducing envy by allowing lesser-valued items to go to agents with fewer allocations if necessary.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - If necessary, reallocate items to achieve a more balanced distribution if some agents end up with no items due to initial allocation.

Following this strategy, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 76.
- **Item 1:** Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 98.
- **Item 2:** Agent 2 values item 2 the most at 99.
- **Item 3:** Agent 3 values item 3 the most at 85.
- **Item 4:** Agent 4 values item 4 the most at 77.
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 values item 5 the most at 81.
- **Item 6:** Agent 1 values item 6 the most at 93, but since Agent 1 already has two items, we allocate it to Agent 2, who values it second most at 44.

This allocation gives us:
- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.

Thus, the allocations ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items are:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
