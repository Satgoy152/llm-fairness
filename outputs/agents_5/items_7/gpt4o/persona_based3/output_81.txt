Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  19  40   9  63  83  40
1  28   7  29  90  22  43  54
2  55  53  89  84  64  59  96
3   3  55  46  90  79  41  30
4  49  76  47  70  96  27  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own, based on their valuation. Given the complex nature of the problem and the constraints that we must allocate all items, a systematic approach to solving this involves finding a balanced distribution based on the agents' valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** Sum up each agent's valuation across all items to understand their total valuation.

2. **Proportional Fairness Check:** Ensure that each agent receives a share of the total valuation proportional to their valuation of items.

3. **Greedy Allocation Method:** Allocate items in a manner that maximizes the minimum satisfaction of the agents, often starting with the highest valued items by each agent.

4. **Adjustment for Envy-Freeness:** Adjust the allocation to minimize envy where possible, balancing allocations among agents.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Highest value items are 5 (83) and 4 (63). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Highest value items are 3 (90) and 6 (54). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Highest value items are 6 (96) and 2 (89). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Highest value items are 3 (90) and 4 (79). Item 3 is already allocated, so assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4:** Highest value items are 4 (96) and 6 (85). Item 4 is already allocated, so assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 1 to ensure all items are allocated.

- **Remaining Items 0 and 1 Allocation:**
  - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (second highest value after 6).
  - Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (second highest value after 2).

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the highest individual preferences of each agent, while ensuring all items are allocated and minimizing potential envy.
