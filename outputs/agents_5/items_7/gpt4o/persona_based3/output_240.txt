Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   7  26  77  59   2  85  82
1  94  51  22  16  45   5  63
2  42  74  57  57   7  62  65
3  77  51  96  40  82  21  19
4   2  55  67  94  61  86  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This approach aims to maximize the product of the utilities of agents, which often results in fair and envy-free allocations.

To implement this, we will calculate the best allocation of items to maximize the product of the valuations each agent receives. Here is a potential fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 highly, so it makes sense to allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 highly, so allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly, so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly, so allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 highly, so allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
6. The remaining items (4 and 6) can be allocated to minimize envy and balance the allocation. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 and item 4 to Agent 3.

This allocation respects each agent's preferences and attempts to ensure fairness and minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 6.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 4 receives item 3. 

This distribution should maximize fairness based on the given valuations.
