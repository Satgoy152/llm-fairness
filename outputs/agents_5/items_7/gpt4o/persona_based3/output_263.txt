Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  86  20  99  56  81  55
1  54  55  72  94  84  37  22
2  84  59  18  60  66  75  84
3  43   1   0   2  40  34  71
4  26  46  31  25  26  88  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free or fair allocation of the 7 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One possible approach to ensure fairness is to maximize the minimum value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent feels they are getting a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: Look for items that have significantly higher valuations by specific agents compared to others. Allocating these items to those agents can satisfy high-value demands.

2. **Balance Remaining Items**: For the remaining items, try to distribute them so that each agent receives a fair share relative to their valuations.

3. **Ensure Completeness**: Make sure all 7 items are allocated, and no agent is left without any items unless it's unavoidable.

Given the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  26  86  20  99  56  81  55
1  54  55  72  94  84  37  22
2  84  59  18  60  66  75  84
3  43   1   0   2  40  34  71
4  26  46  31  25  26  88  20
```

**Allocation Strategy**:
- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (99).
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (84) and item 3 (94) but can be satisfied with item 4 if 3 is taken by Agent 0.
- Agent 2 values items 0 (84) and 6 (84) highly.
- Agent 3 has a relatively high preference for item 6 (71).
- Agent 4 values item 5 (88) highly.

**Proposed Allocation**:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 6
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Items 1, 5, 2

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their own valuations and ensures all 7 items are distributed.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format**:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 5, 2]
}
```
