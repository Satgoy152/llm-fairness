Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  93  35  92  60  79  56  19
1  89  33  24  98  18  33  67
2  67  72  60  16  67  13  20
3  52   1  99  78  21  26  46
4  85   3   7  62  54  15  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7. One approach to achieve a fair division is to use the concept of maximizing the minimum value (or ensuring that the allocation is envy-free if possible). Given the valuations, let's aim to distribute the items such that each agent has a fair share according to their preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items to the agents:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 0 and 2 the most, so assign them item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 3, so assign them item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 1, so assign them item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 2, so assign them item 2.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 6, so assign them item 6.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.

6. **Agent 0**: Can also be given item 4, which they value reasonably high.
7. **Agent 4**: Can be given item 5, which they value similarly to other unallocated items.

This allocation attempts to respect the preferences of each agent to the extent possible given the constraints. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 7 items to the agents, ensuring that each agent receives at least some of their higher-valued items.
