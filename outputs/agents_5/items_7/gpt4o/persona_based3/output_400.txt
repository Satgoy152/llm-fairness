Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   3   2  59  41  29  76  38
1  80  12  87  60  93  90  42
2  45  61  47  61  56  89  25
3  57  51   7  21  68  59  37
4  30  28  19  77  17  10  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means trying to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has relatively low valuations, with the highest being 76 for item 5. We'll assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for several items, but significantly values item 4 the most with a value of 93. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highly, but this is already taken by Agent 0. Instead, item 1 has a value of 61, which is relatively high for Agent 2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a moderate spread of values. Let's assign item 0 to Agent 3, which is valued at 57.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 the most at 82. Assign item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (items 2 and 3):

- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 1 who values it at 87 (the highest among all agents for this item).
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 4 who values it at 77 (the highest among remaining agents for this item).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation takes into consideration the highest valuations for each agent and aims to distribute the items fairly among them.
