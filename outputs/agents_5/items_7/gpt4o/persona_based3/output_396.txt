Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   2  51  33  65  43  32  29
1  80  36  26  53  97  91  49
2   6  83  17  25  23  61  95
3  58  96   3  65  13  20  71
4   8  16  25  89  98  78  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an approach that takes into account the agents' valuations of the items. The goal is to minimize envy by distributing the items in a way that each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible.

Given the table of valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 2      | 51     | 33     | 65     | 43     | 32     | 29     |
| 1     | 80     | 36     | 26     | 53     | 97     | 91     | 49     |
| 2     | 6      | 83     | 17     | 25     | 23     | 61     | 95     |
| 3     | 58     | 96     | 3      | 65     | 13     | 20     | 71     |
| 4     | 8      | 16     | 25     | 89     | 98     | 78     | 46     |

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Identify Preferences:** Start by identifying each agent's highest-valued items to guide the initial allocation.
2. **Allocate Items Iteratively:** Distribute the items by iteratively assigning the highest-valued available item to each agent in a round-robin fashion.
3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:** Continue the process until all items are allocated.

### Proposed Allocation
Based on the valuation matrix and aiming for an envy-free distribution, here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [3] - Highest valuation for item 3.
- **Agent 1:** Items [4, 0] - Highest valuation for item 4 and then item 0.
- **Agent 2:** Items [6] - Highest valuation for item 6.
- **Agent 3:** Items [1] - Highest valuation for item 1.
- **Agent 4:** Items [5, 2] - Highest valuation for items 5 and then item 2.

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.

### JSON Format of Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to satisfy the fairness criterion by distributing items based on the agents' valuations, minimizing potential envy among them.
