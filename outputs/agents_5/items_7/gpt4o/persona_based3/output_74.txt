Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  99  28   5  55  63  25
1  36  65  54  75  97  41  82
2   5  54  60  92  14  37  85
3  62  67  70  84   7  87  48
4  39  48  91  89  23  32  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation. This often involves ensuring that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as that of any other agent, according to their own valuation.

Given the table of valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 61     | 99     | 28     | 5      | 55     | 63     | 25     |
| 1     | 36     | 65     | 54     | 75     | 97     | 41     | 82     |
| 2     | 5      | 54     | 60     | 92     | 14     | 37     | 85     |
| 3     | 62     | 67     | 70     | 84     | 7      | 87     | 48     |
| 4     | 39     | 48     | 91     | 89     | 23     | 32     | 55     |

We can use a heuristic approach to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocation, while also considering the overall distribution to maintain fairness. One approach is to use a round-robin or a bidding procedure, but here I'll directly propose an allocation that aims to be fair given the constraints:

Allocation plan:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet, if possible.
2. Iterate to assign remaining items while considering each agent's next highest preference.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most, so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest, so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most, so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest, so we allocate item 5 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most, so we allocate item 2 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and 2 items remain unallocated (items 0 and 6). We distribute these items by considering next highest preferences for remaining agents:

- Agent 0 has item 0 as their next highest preference, allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the next, allocate item 6 to agent 2.

This gives us a fair allocation based on current preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance individual preferences while ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly.
