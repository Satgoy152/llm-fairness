Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  18  34  32  13  13  64
1  19  89  33  69  28  47  37
2  81  31  29  33  79  88  43
3  79  93   1  28  26  92  51
4  35  22  32  38  31  77  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own. This can be challenging, but we'll strive to achieve a reasonable allocation.

### Steps to Achieve Fair Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: \(46 + 18 + 34 + 32 + 13 + 13 + 64 = 220\)
   - Agent 1: \(19 + 89 + 33 + 69 + 28 + 47 + 37 = 322\)
   - Agent 2: \(81 + 31 + 29 + 33 + 79 + 88 + 43 = 384\)
   - Agent 3: \(79 + 93 + 1 + 28 + 26 + 92 + 51 = 370\)
   - Agent 4: \(35 + 22 + 32 + 38 + 31 + 77 + 90 = 325\)

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Aim to give each agent items they value highly to minimize envy.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign items in a manner that balances the total value perceived by each agent.

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Assign Item 6 (value 64)
  - Assign Item 0 (value 46)

- **Agent 1**:
  - Assign Item 1 (value 89)
  - Assign Item 3 (value 69)

- **Agent 2**:
  - Assign Item 5 (value 88)

- **Agent 3**:
  - Assign Item 2 (value 1, although it's a low value, we balance by overall distribution)

- **Agent 4**:
  - Assign Item 4 (value 31)

### Resulting Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring all 7 items are allocated.
