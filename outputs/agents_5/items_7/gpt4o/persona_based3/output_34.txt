Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  27   9  69  18  53  59  98
1  73  97  79  46  23   9  48
2  50  64   1  95  87  22  94
3  45  87  81  66  16  54  51
4  16  21  61  95  40  96  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness and balance the total valuations each agent receives to ensure fairness. In this setup, each agent should receive a subset of the items such that no agent feels envy towards another agent's allocation.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation for their assigned items is as equal as possible.
3. Consider the valuations and try to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's first examine the total valuations of each agent for all items:

- Agent 0: 27 + 9 + 69 + 18 + 53 + 59 + 98 = 333
- Agent 1: 73 + 97 + 79 + 46 + 23 + 9 + 48 = 375
- Agent 2: 50 + 64 + 1 + 95 + 87 + 22 + 94 = 413
- Agent 3: 45 + 87 + 81 + 66 + 16 + 54 + 51 = 400
- Agent 4: 16 + 21 + 61 + 95 + 40 + 96 + 52 = 381

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Start by allocating the highest valued items for each agent based on their preferences.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives roughly equal value from their perspective.

Based on this strategy, here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: [6] (98 is the highest single valuation for Agent 0)
- Agent 1: [1, 4] (97 is highest for item 1 and 23 for item 4)
- Agent 2: [3] (95 is significant for item 3)
- Agent 3: [2, 5] (87 for item 1 is significant but already taken, 81 for item 2 and 54 for item 5)
- Agent 4: [0] (95 for item 3 is significant but already taken, 96 for item 5 but already taken, 61 for item 2 but already taken, 16 for item 0 is remaining)

This allocation respects the preferences of the agents and distributes the items fairly based on their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [0]
}
```
