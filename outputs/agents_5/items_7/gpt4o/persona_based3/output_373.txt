Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  12  40  99  33  16  47  13
1   3  26  46  54  86  55   2
2  13  26  82  73  98  87  22
3  76  94  17  27  73  46  20
4  49   4  48   5  82  24  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to assign items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This situation can be complex because it involves balancing each agent's preferences and the total value they get from their allocated items. Since we have 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others.

First, let's summarize the values for each agent for all items:

- Agent 0: [12, 40, 99, 33, 16, 47, 13]
- Agent 1: [3, 26, 46, 54, 86, 55, 2]
- Agent 2: [13, 26, 82, 73, 98, 87, 22]
- Agent 3: [76, 94, 17, 27, 73, 46, 20]
- Agent 4: [49, 4, 48, 5, 82, 24, 57]

We will try to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Each agent has items they value highly. We aim to allocate high-value items to ensure perceived fairness.
2. **Balance Total Value:** Try to balance the total perceived value each agent receives.
3. **Assign Remaining Items:** Distribute remaining items to optimize individual satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Proposed Allocation
- **Agent 0:** Items [2] - This item provides high value (99) for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Items [4, 5] - These items have high values for Agent 1 (86 and 55 respectively).
- **Agent 2:** Item [3] - This item has a high value for Agent 2 (73).
- **Agent 3:** Item [1] - This item is highly valued by Agent 3 (94).
- **Agent 4:** Items [0, 6] - These items provide relatively high value for Agent 4 (49 and 57).

### JSON Allocation
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their assigned items while ensuring that all items are distributed. The items are allocated based on each agent's highest valuation to ensure fairness and minimize envy.
