Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  43  34  70  65  46  55  95
1  88  32  20  31   7  76   2
2  21  16  62   8  92  14   9
3  36   3  10  51  16  50  64
4  49  32   0  76  11  29  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the five agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, though with integer allocations and varying valuations, perfect envy-freeness might not always be achievable. We'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have a fair share.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
        Items
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6
Agents
0      43  34  70  65  46  55  95
1      88  32  20  31   7  76   2
2      21  16  62   8  92  14   9
3      36   3  10  51  16  50  64
4      49  32   0  76  11  29  98
```

Based on a careful observation of the given valuations, let's try to allocate items to maximize each agent's perceived value:

1. **Agent 0:** Prefers item 6 the most with a valuation of 95.
2. **Agent 1:** Prefers item 0 the most with a valuation of 88.
3. **Agent 2:** Prefers item 4 the most with a valuation of 92.
4. **Agent 3:** Prefers item 3 the most with a valuation of 51.
5. **Agent 4:** Prefers item 6 the most, which is already taken by Agent 0, so the next best is item 3, which is also taken by Agent 3. The next highest is item 0, which is taken by Agent 1, so let's give them item 5 with a value of 29.

After satisfying the strongest preferences, we allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** also values item 2 highly (70), so we assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** can have item 1, which they value at 32.
- **Agent 3** can have item 5, which they also value at 50.

This leaves us with item 3, which we have assigned to Agent 3 already, so we review:

Upon reviewing, it seems we have missed item 1, let's proceed with a fair reallocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Items 2 and 6.
2. **Agent 1:** Items 0 and 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Item 4.
4. **Agent 3:** Item 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Item 5.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and attempts to maximize their perceived value based on preferences.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has a fair share of items based on their preferences, while all items are allocated.
