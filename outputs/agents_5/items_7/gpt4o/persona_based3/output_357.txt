Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35  60  42  79  47  70  41
1  71   3  41  54  26  23  55
2  30  30  18  18  41  63   8
3  35  80  59  11  37  86  37
4  16  43   0  69   0  25   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use an approach that maximizes the total value each agent receives, subject to the constraint that each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

Let's analyze and allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is item 3 (79).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is item 0 (71).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is item 5 (63).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is item 5 (86), but since Agent 2 values this a lot too, let's consider another allocation. Agent 3 also values item 1 (80).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is item 3 (69), but since Agent 0 values it a lot as well, let's consider another allocation. Agent 4 can take item 1 (43).

To make sure every agent gets a fair allocation and no item is assigned more than once, let's proceed with the following allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 3, 0 (Total value = 79 + 35 = 114)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 4 (Total value = 26)
3. **Agent 2**: Items 5, 2 (Total value = 63 + 18 = 81)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 1 (Total value = 80)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 6 (Total value = 4)

This allocation keeps every item assigned, and each agent gets a fair share considering their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6]
}
```
