Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  73   3  38  55  17  84
1  36  34  88  35  80  50  13
2  82  76  35  34  59  84   2
3   2  60  78  41  53  80  76
4  80  85   7  54  76  23  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 76 35 34 59 84  2]
 [ 2 60 78 41 53 80 76]
 [80 85  7 54 76 23 56]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. The goal is to divide the items so that no agent feels another agent received a more valuable allocation according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  73   3  38  55  17  84
1  36  34  88  35  80  50  13
2  82  76  35  34  59  84   2
3   2  60  78  41  53  80  76
4  80  85   7  54  76  23  56
```

Let's proceed to allocate the items in a manner that attempts to respect the agents' preferences.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 6 with a valuation of 84. Assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 2 with a valuation of 88. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 5 with a valuation of 84. Assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 2 with a valuation of 78, but it is already assigned. The next highest is item 5 with a valuation of 80, which is also taken. Assign item 1, which is the next highest available item with a valuation of 60, to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 1 with a valuation of 85, but itâ€™s taken. The next highest is item 4 with a valuation of 76. Assign item 4 to agent 4.

Now, allocate the remaining items:
- Items 0 and 3 are still unassigned.

6. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0, the next highest available item with a valuation of 58.
7. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3, the next highest available item with a valuation of 41.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 6, 0
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Items 1, 3
- Agent 4: Item 4

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and attempts to respect each agent's highest valuations.
