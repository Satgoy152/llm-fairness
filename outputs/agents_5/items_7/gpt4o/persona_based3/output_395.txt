Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91   1  32  18  66  69  64
1  73  83   6  79  91  38  77
2  29  54  82  17   4  14  40
3  53  19  78  99   9  38  92
4  63  66   4  27  86  72  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91  1 32 18 66 69 64]
 [73 83  6 79 91 38 77]
 [29 54 82 17  4 14 40]
 [53 19 78 99  9 38 92]
 [63 66  4 27 86 72 26]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free division as much as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the nature of this problem with discrete items, achieving complete envy-freeness may not always be possible, but we will aim to minimize envy.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91   1  32  18  66  69  64
1  73  83   6  79  91  38  77
2  29  54  82  17   4  14  40
3  53  19  78  99   9  38  92
4  63  66   4  27  86  72  26
```

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0 (91), so let's allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (91), so let's allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (82), so let's allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (99), so let's allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 5 (72), so let's allocate item 5 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 2 more items.

6. For the remaining items 1 and 6, let's consider the next highest valuations:
   - Item 1: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (83).
   - Item 6: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (92).

Given this, let's allocate:
- Item 1 to agent 1.
- Item 6 to agent 3.

This allocation minimizes potential envy by focusing on each agent's highest valued items first and then filling in with the next highest preferences when possible.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```
