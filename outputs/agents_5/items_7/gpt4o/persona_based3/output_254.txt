Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  38  47  46   0  23  84
1  26  82  40  92  70  11  51
2  72  84  56   0  73  93  95
3  40  26  23  36  42  32  71
4  35  32  39   2  66  36  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming to achieve envy-freeness, we need to carefully consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent envies another based on the perceived value of the allocations.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 with a value of 84. We can allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 with a value of 92. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 5 with a value of 93. We can allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** can be allocated item 0, which has a value of 40, as it is their highest relative valuation compared to other agents.
5. **Agent 4** can be allocated item 4, which has a value of 66, maximizing their utility.

Now, we have allocated five items. We need to allocate the remaining two items, 1 and 2, in a way that maintains a fair distribution:

- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 at 82, which is the highest among all agents. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 at 47, which is the highest among the remaining agents. We can allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

This allocation results in the following distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 1
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 4

This distribution is designed to minimize envy and maximize each agent's perceived utility based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
