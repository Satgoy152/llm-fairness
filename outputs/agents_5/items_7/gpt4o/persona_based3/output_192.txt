Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  13   8  65  69   9  91   8
1  57  55  95   5  83  52  61
2  43  90  38  33  26  38  47
3  87  41  25  33  44  57  18
4  29  50  59  53  19  12  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free distribution if possible, or at least minimize envy. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High Value Preferences:** Start by looking for the highest valuations for each item across all agents to ensure that highly valued items are likely to be allocated to agents who value them the most.

2. **Allocate Items with Unique High Value:** If an item has a unique highest valuation by one agent, allocate that item to that agent.

3. **Handle Ties and Remaining Items:** For items with tied highest valuations or no unique highest preference, distribute them in a way that maintains balance in the total value each agent receives.

Based on the table, let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0:** Highest value is by Agent 3 (87).
- **Item 1:** Highest value is by Agent 2 (90).
- **Item 2:** Highest value is by Agent 1 (95).
- **Item 3:** Highest value is by Agent 0 (69).
- **Item 4:** Highest value is by Agent 1 (83) but Agent 0 could also be considered (9).
- **Item 5:** Highest value is by Agent 0 (91).
- **Item 6:** Highest value is by Agent 4 (92).

Let's allocate based on these preferences:

- **Agent 0:** Item 3, Item 5
- **Agent 1:** Item 2, Item 4
- **Agent 2:** Item 1
- **Agent 3:** Item 0
- **Agent 4:** Item 6

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring all items are allocated.
