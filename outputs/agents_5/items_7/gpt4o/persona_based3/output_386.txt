Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  96  79   3  37  54  71
1  76  94   6  39  22  91  91
2  97  84  47  50  82  75  36
3  82  35  30   1  84  63  64
4  42  48  18  30  89  34  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, the goal is to find a fair allocation of items to agents such that each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own.

One approach to achieve this is to use a method like "Round Robin" or "Maximum Nash Welfare," but considering the problem constraints and the size, I will use a heuristic approach to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest-valued remaining item.

Here is how the allocation can be performed:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations - item 1 (96), item 2 (79)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations - item 1 (94), item 5 (91), item 6 (91)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations - item 0 (97), item 1 (84), item 4 (82)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations - item 0 (82), item 4 (84)
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations - item 4 (89)

Next, we allocate the items based on these preferences ensuring no item is allocated more than once, and each agent has at least one item.

**Allocation Strategy:**
- Start with the most valued items and allocate them to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
- Resolve conflicts by considering the next highest valued item for an agent if their top choice is already taken.

**Final Allocation:**
- **Agent 0**: [1] (96 is strongly preferred by Agent 0 and 1, but we assign it to Agent 0 to balance overall allocations)
- **Agent 1**: [5, 6] (Agent 1 values these equally and gets both since they are next in line)
- **Agent 2**: [0] (97 is the highest single value, assigned to Agent 2)
- **Agent 3**: [4] (84 is highly valued after 0 is taken)
- **Agent 4**: [2, 3] (Remaining items, but 4 has a high valuation for 4)

These steps help ensure each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences, and it maintains an overall balance in allocations.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```
