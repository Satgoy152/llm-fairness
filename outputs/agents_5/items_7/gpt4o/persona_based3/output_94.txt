Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  13  73  46  77  21  57
1  68  89  28  65  14  51  89
2  34  25  11  80  76  24   1
3  97  61   7  94  37  93  70
4  37  50  61  46   0  90  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the goal of minimizing envy and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of the minimum values each agent receives. This approach can help in achieving a fair distribution.

Given the agents' valuations, we should try to allocate the items so that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation. We will first identify items that are particularly important to each agent based on their valuations and try to allocate those items to them if possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Values item 4 the most (77), followed by item 2 (73).
- Agent 1: Values item 1 (89) and item 6 (89) the most.
- Agent 2: Values item 3 (80) the most, followed by item 4 (76).
- Agent 3: Values item 0 (97) the most, followed by item 5 (93).
- Agent 4: Values item 5 (90) the most, followed by item 2 (61).

To ensure a fair allocation, we will try to distribute the highest valued items to each agent in a way that balances their overall satisfaction:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (tied highest value for Agent 1).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 4 (highest value for Agent 4).
6. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (tied highest value for Agent 1).

Now, we present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each agent and attempts to distribute the items in a manner that respects their preferences, aiming for fairness and reducing envy.
