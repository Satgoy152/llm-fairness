Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  50  86  97  61  65  89
1  33   1  82   5  61  12  49
2  90  27  87  18  72  91   9
3  45  49  48  78  81   3  97
4  48  90  67  10  35  58  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to use the maximum Nash welfare, which involves maximizing the product of the valuations of the items each agent receives. However, given the complexity of finding the exact solution, we will aim for a reasonable allocation that ensures each agent receives a fair share based on the given valuations.

Here is a step-by-step explanation of one possible allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: Look for items that are highly valued by specific agents and consider allocating those items to them if it contributes significantly to their overall satisfaction.

2. **Allocate items greedily but fairly**: Start by allocating the highest valued items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that no agent is left without items unless necessary.

3. **Balance the allocations**: Ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value, adjusting allocations to minimize envy where possible.

Following these principles, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 3 and 6. Allocating item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2. Allocating item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 5. Allocating item 0 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly. Allocating item 6 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly. Allocating item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, let's review and adjust:

- Agent 2 has one of the highest remaining valuations for items 5, so also allocating item 5 to Agent 2.
- Agent 0 has a remaining high valuation for item 4, so allocating item 4 to Agent 0.

This allocation attempts to balance the individual valuations and ensure each agent has a fair share within the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the 5 agents, considering their individual valuations, and aims for a fair division.
