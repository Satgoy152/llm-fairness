Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  21   1  23  15   2   7
1  54  67   9  21  13  98  74
2  17  34  26  80   9  69  37
3  18  35   9  16  44  13  22
4  47  55  29  54  35  12  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. Envy-freeness means no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. Given the constraints, we have 5 agents and 7 items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - There are 35 total valuations (sum of all agents' valuations for each item).
   - Each agent will receive at least 1 item since there are 7 items and 5 agents.

2. **Envy-free Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by identifying items with clear preferences.
   - Allocate the highest valued items to the agent who values them the most.
   - Check for any remaining items and allocate them considering the next best preferences.

3. **Allocation Process**:
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 98. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 80. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 4 values item 6 the highest at 77. Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 25. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 3 has no item yet, and their highest preference among remaining items is item 4 at 44. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
   - Two items remain (1 and 2). We now aim for each agent to have similar number of items as possible.
   - Agent 1 has higher valuation on item 1 at 67, assign item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Finally, assign item 2 to Agent 4 since they have a higher preference for it among the remaining agents.

4. **Resulting Allocations**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets items 1 and 5.
   - Agent 2 gets item 3.
   - Agent 3 gets item 4.
   - Agent 4 gets items 2 and 6.

Thus, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```
