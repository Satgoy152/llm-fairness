Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  82  43  91  59   8  55
1  13   5  82  24  13   7  20
2  30   1  97  96  63  95   5
3  41  60  30  59  26  81   5
4  50  94  38  91  36   7  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 60 30 59 26 81  5]
 [50 94 38 91 36  7 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring the allocation is envy-free if possible. Envy-freeness means no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

We can use a simple algorithm to allocate items, considering each agent's valuation and attempting to balance the total value each receives:

1. **Agent 0:** Prioritize the items with the highest values. Agent 0 values Item 3 highest at 91, followed by Item 1 at 82. Assign these items to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1:** The highest values are for Item 2 at 82 and Item 0 at 13. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** This agent values Item 2 highest at 97, but it is already allocated. The next highest is Item 3 at 96. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** The highest value is for Item 5 at 81. Assign Item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:** Item 1 is valued highest at 94, but it is already allocated. The next highest is Item 3 at 91, but it is also allocated. Item 0 is at 50. Assign Item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items [4, 6] to achieve a fair result. 

- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0, as it values it at 55.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 2, as it values it at 63.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance total values across agents while adhering to the constraints provided.
