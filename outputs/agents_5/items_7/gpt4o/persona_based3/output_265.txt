Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  35   9  97  61  10  57  47
1  48  88  81  74  74  68  43
2  22  57  78  72  71  36   3
3   6  54   8  50  52  73  25
4  85  18  68  56  86  25  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for envy-freeness where possible. Given that there are 5 agents and 7 items, each agent will not necessarily receive an equal number of items, but we can strive to make each agent as satisfied as possible based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step approach to finding an allocation that approximates envy-freeness:

1. **Calculate the total value for each agent:** Sum the valuations for all items for each agent to understand their overall preference intensity.

2. **Rank items for each agent:** Determine which items each agent values the most, creating a preference list for each.

3. **Greedy allocation based on preference rankings:** Assign items to agents starting with the highest valued items for each agent, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once.

4. **Adjust allocations for fairness:** Ensure that no agent envies another by checking if any unallocated items improve an agent's satisfaction relative to their current allocation.

### Calculations and Allocation

**Total Valuation per Agent:**

- Agent 0: \( 35 + 9 + 97 + 61 + 10 + 57 + 47 = 316 \)
- Agent 1: \( 48 + 88 + 81 + 74 + 74 + 68 + 43 = 476 \)
- Agent 2: \( 22 + 57 + 78 + 72 + 71 + 36 + 3 = 339 \)
- Agent 3: \( 6 + 54 + 8 + 50 + 52 + 73 + 25 = 268 \)
- Agent 4: \( 85 + 18 + 68 + 56 + 86 + 25 + 82 = 420 \)

**Initial Allocation by Preference:**

- **Agent 0**'s highest value is for item 2.
- **Agent 1**'s highest value is for item 1.
- **Agent 2**'s highest value is for item 2 (already taken, next is item 3).
- **Agent 3**'s highest value is for item 5.
- **Agent 4**'s highest value is for item 4.

Assign these items to the respective agents:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 4

**Allocate Remaining Items:**

- Remaining items: 0, 6
- Check remaining items against agent preferences and current allocations to ensure no envy.

**Final Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6] (second preference for Agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [5]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 0] (second preference for Agent 4)

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by considering each agent's preferences and ensuring each agent receives items they highly value.

    "0": [2, 6],

    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 0]
}
```
