Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  46  15  55   3  68  32
1  14  11  21  21  90  53  21
2  17  81  57  76  91  41  25
3  23  32  27  40   6  39  26
4  39  66  55  15   7  53  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to make sure that each agent is as satisfied as possible with the items they receive, minimizing envy among agents.

One approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "sequential allocation" or "round-robin" where each agent, in some order, picks their most valued item among the remaining ones. However, since we are aiming for a fair allocation, we need to ensure that the distribution is as balanced as possible in terms of perceived value by each agent.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent places on all items and determine a fair share.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their valuations while respecting others' preferences to minimize envy.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0, so they should receive it.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest, so they should receive it.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4 but since itâ€™s already allocated, they can get item 2 and item 6 as these also have relatively high valuations.
- Agent 3 should receive item 5 as it is one of the higher-valued remaining items for them.
- Agent 4 values item 1 and item 3 higher among the remaining items.

Let's allocate the items based on these considerations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 0, which they value the most.
- Agent 1 receives item 4, which they value the most.
- Agent 2 receives items 2 and 6, which they value more than most other items.
- Agent 3 receives item 5.
- Agent 4 receives items 1 and 3, which are among the highest-valued remaining items for them.

This allocation attempts to be fair by distributing items according to each agent's preferences while ensuring that each agent receives some valued items.
