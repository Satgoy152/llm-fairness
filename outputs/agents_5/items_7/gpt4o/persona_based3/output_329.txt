Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  70  57  20   0  78  46  82
1  29  81  31  54  73  25  11
2  47  74  24  72   1  36  50
3  21  93  91  60  55  58  52
4   9  14  33  25   4  49  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's bundle of items over their own. Given the valuation matrix, let's first analyze the preferences and try to distribute the items accordingly.

Here is a potential allocation of items to agents:

- **Agent 0**: Prefers item 6 the most (value 82), followed by item 4 (value 78).
- **Agent 1**: Prefers item 1 the most (value 81).
- **Agent 2**: Prefers item 3 the most (value 72), followed by item 1 (value 74), but item 1 is already taken.
- **Agent 3**: Prefers item 1 the most (value 93), but item 1 is already taken. Also values item 2 highly (value 91).
- **Agent 4**: Has relatively low values for all items compared to others, but prefers item 5 (value 49).

Taking these preferences into account, here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [6, 4] - Highest value items available to them.
- **Agent 1**: [1] - Highest valued item for them.
- **Agent 2**: [3] - Highest available valued item for them.
- **Agent 3**: [2] - Highest available valued item for them.
- **Agent 4**: [0, 5] - Remaining items, with item 5 being the best for Agent 4.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to respect the highest preferences of each agent as much as possible. Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```
