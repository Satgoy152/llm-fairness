Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  63  76  73  18   4  39  98
1  62  24  35  56  76  63  87
2  44  86  86  56  62  55   8
3  29   5  38  12  60  21   7
4  25  94  33  46  89  73  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with respect to their valuations, we aim to ensure that the allocations are envy-free, if possible, and that each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal here is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 6 (98), 1 (76), and 2 (73).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 6 (87) and 4 (76).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (86) and 2 (86).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (60) and 2 (38).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (94) and 4 (89).

To achieve a fair distribution, we can consider assigning items such that agents receive their most valued items where possible, while also ensuring all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 6.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 4.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 2.
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 5.

This leaves items 0 and 3 unallocated. We then assign these items to ensure no agent is left without an item and to try and balance fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (to balance overall distribution).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent gets at least one item, and preferences are respected as much as possible given the constraints.
