Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55  61  42   4  23  84  53
1  11  87  82  34  52  98  35
2  94  36  57   5  91  34   3
3  24  80  22  45  48   0  99
4  10  99  40  18  13  74   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while attempting to minimize envy, we need to consider each agent's valuations and distribute the items to maximize overall satisfaction. A common approach is to use the envy-free up to one item (EF1) criterion, which means no agent should feel envy towards another agent's allocation if they can remove one item from the other agentâ€™s bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items accordingly:

| Agent | Items Valued Highly |
|-------|---------------------|
| 0     | 5 (84), 1 (61), 0 (55) |
| 1     | 5 (98), 1 (87), 2 (82) |
| 2     | 0 (94), 4 (91), 2 (57) |
| 3     | 6 (99), 1 (80), 4 (48) |
| 4     | 1 (99), 5 (74), 2 (40) |

The goal is to distribute these items to maximize the total value for each agent while keeping envy minimal:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 5 and 1.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 5 and 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 0 and 4.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 6 and 1.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 1 and 5.

Considering the above preferences, let's try to allocate the items:

- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most at 98, so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most at 99, so allocate to Agent 4.
- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 94, so allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most at 99, so allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it highly at 91, so allocate to Agent 2.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it highly at 82, so allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Not highly valued by any, allocate to Agent 0 to ensure all agents receive at least one item.

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent receives something of value.
