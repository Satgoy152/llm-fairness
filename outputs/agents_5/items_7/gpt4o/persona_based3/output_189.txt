Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  60  47  98  36  16   0  59
1  69  16  79  36  32  17  58
2  83  47  72  96  25  41   2
3  91  80  25  69  81  83  66
4  88  42  77  49  43  13  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, one approach is to use the "round-robin" method, which allows agents to take turns picking their most valued available item. This method aims to ensure that each agent receives an allocation that is as close as possible to their preferences, minimizing envy.

Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Calculate the total value of all items for each agent** to determine who should pick first. This is often based on the sum of their valuations for the items.
2. **Order the agents based on their total value**, with the agent having the highest total value picking first.
3. **Let each agent pick their most valued unallocated item** in turn, from highest to lowest total value, ensuring that each agent gets a fair chance to pick.
4. **Repeat the picking process in reverse order** until all items are allocated. This back-and-forth ensures a fair distribution.

Let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 60 + 47 + 98 + 36 + 16 + 0 + 59 = 316
- Agent 1: 69 + 16 + 79 + 36 + 32 + 17 + 58 = 307
- Agent 2: 83 + 47 + 72 + 96 + 25 + 41 + 2 = 366
- Agent 3: 91 + 80 + 25 + 69 + 81 + 83 + 66 = 495
- Agent 4: 88 + 42 + 77 + 49 + 43 + 13 + 27 = 339

Ordering agents from highest to lowest total value:
1. Agent 3
2. Agent 2
3. Agent 4
4. Agent 0
5. Agent 1

**Round 1:**
- Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 69).
- Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 83).
- Agent 4 picks item 2 (value 77).
- Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 59).
- Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 32).

**Round 2 (Reverse Order):**
- Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 16).
- Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 0).

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation method ensures that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy, given the constraints of the problem.
