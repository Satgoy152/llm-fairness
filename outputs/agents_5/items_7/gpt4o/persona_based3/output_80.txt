Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   1  90  83  42   0  53  29
1  37  80  59  87   1  57  84
2  91  67  38  27   6  58   6
3  54  87  19   9  96  13  21
4  61  70  57  58  59   4  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the limited number of items, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible, but we can attempt to minimize envy.

One heuristic approach is to allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. We'll iteratively assign the highest valued remaining item to the agent that values it most until all items are allocated.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 91, the highest among all agents.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 90, the highest among all agents.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 83, the highest among all agents.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 87, the highest among all agents.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 3 values it at 96, the highest among all agents.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 58, but since Agent 2 already has two items, we consider others.
   - Agent 1 values it at 57, the highest among the remaining agents.

7. **Item 6:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 84, the highest among all agents.

After this allocation, every agent has received at least one item, except for agent 4. To correct this and ensure each agent gets an item, we can adjust the allocation slightly:

- Transfer Item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 4.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item. While perfect envy-freeness might not be achieved, this distribution attempts to minimize it given the constraints.
