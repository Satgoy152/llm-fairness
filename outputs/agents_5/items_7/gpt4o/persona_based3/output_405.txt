Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  95  93  23  10  75  71
1  18  35  87  69  13  72  64
2  61  75  48  94  52  63  42
3  99  94   1  13  51   0  86
4  53  28  93   3  57   6  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [53 28 93  3 57  6 12]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use principles of fair division, aiming for envy-freeness where possible. Given the valuations:

```
Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  11  95  93  23  10  75  71
1  18  35  87  69  13  72  64
2  61  75  48  94  52  63  42
3  99  94   1  13  51   0  86
4  53  28  93   3  57   6  12
```

We'll aim to distribute the items in a manner that tries to minimize envy. Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values items 1 and 2.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 2.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 3.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 0.
- **Agent 4** highly values item 2, but since it's already allocated, we'll aim to give them their next preferred items.

A possible allocation that satisfies these preferences while ensuring each agent has a fair share might be:

1. **Agent 0** gets item 1 (value 95).
2. **Agent 1** gets item 2 (value 87).
3. **Agent 2** gets item 3 (value 94).
4. **Agent 3** gets items 0 and 6 (values 99 and 86).
5. **Agent 4** gets items 4 and 5 (values 57 and 6).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one high-value item according to their preferences.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints, assigning all 7 items while aiming for a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
