Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  36  44  79   3  83   5
1  33  57  78  65  19  39  29
2  16  10   4  85   3  38  42
3  49  66  97   4   5  34  43
4  65   9  11  74  56  72  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 36 44 79  3 83  5]
 [33 57 78 65 19 39 29]
 [16 10  4 85  3 38 42]
 [49 66 97  4  5 34 43]
 [65  9 11 74 56 72 20]]
Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own. Given the valuations, one possible approach is to use a method like the adjusted winner procedure or the envy-free matching algorithm. However, since we have to allocate exactly 7 items among 5 agents, let's try to ensure that no agent feels envious by carefully distributing the items based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [25, 36, 44, 79, 3, 83, 5]
Agent 1: [33, 57, 78, 65, 19, 39, 29]
Agent 2: [16, 10, 4, 85, 3, 38, 42]
Agent 3: [49, 66, 97, 4, 5, 34, 43]
Agent 4: [65, 9, 11, 74, 56, 72, 20]
```

Let's try to allocate items in a way that balances out the differences in valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 5 (value 83).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 (value 78).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (value 85).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (value 97), but since it's already allocated, we allocate item 1 (value 66).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 0 (value 65).

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** can also receive item 3 (value 79).
- **Agent 4** can receive item 4 (value 56).

By this allocation, we ensure each item is allocated only once, and we try to match the highest preferences for each agent without causing envy. Let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one highly valued item according to their preferences, making the distribution as fair and envy-free as possible given the constraints.
