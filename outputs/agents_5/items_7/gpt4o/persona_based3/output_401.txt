Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  91  90  85  30  13  32  42
1  43  92  48  29  55  63  95
2  78  36  24  57  38  14  47
3  17  18  74  69  27  80   9
4  18  83  48  62  32  88  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in such a way that minimizes envy. One method to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) approach, which balances efficiency and fairness.

Let's evaluate the agents' preferences and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 (91) and item 1 (90) the most.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 (95) and item 1 (92) the most.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 (78) the most.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 (80) and item 3 (69) the most.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 (88) and item 1 (83) the most.

Given these valuations, we will allocate the items to maximize overall satisfaction:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since they value it highly, and it's also highly valued by Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 since it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it is one of their highest valued items, and item 5 has been allocated to Agent 4.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since it is their second-highest valued item and Agent 0 already received item 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 since their highest remaining value is item 3, which they already received.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 since other higher valued items are already allocated.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the highest values each agent places on the available items while ensuring each agent receives a fair share.
