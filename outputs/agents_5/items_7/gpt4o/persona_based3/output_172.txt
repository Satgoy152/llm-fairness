Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  72  70   1  28   9  32  13
1  15  18  50  81  36  68  72
2  65  45  77  66  87  28  53
3  97  80  83  86  76  33   6
4   3  10  54  18  26  38  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent based on their own valuation.

Considering the valuations given in the table, let's proceed with an allocation strategy. One approach could be to first allocate the highest valued item for each agent and then distribute the remaining items while trying to maintain envy-freeness as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 72.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 81.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 87.
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the most at 97 (already taken by agent 0), second highest is item 3 at 86 (already taken by agent 1), third highest is item 2 at 83.
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the most at 54 (already taken by agent 3), second highest is item 5 at 38.

2. Allocate the highest valued item to each agent:
   - Agent 0 gets item 0.
   - Agent 1 gets item 3.
   - Agent 2 gets item 4.
   - Agent 3 gets item 2.
   - Agent 4 gets item 5.

3. Allocate remaining items:
   - Items 1 and 6 are remaining.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 0, as their next highest preference is item 1 at 70.
   - Assign item 6 to agent 1, as their next highest preference is item 6 at 72.

This allocation should balance the distribution based on each agent's preferences and maintain relative fairness.

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```
