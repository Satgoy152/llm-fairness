Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  42  25  37  39  92  72  12
1  53  43   0  22  71  20  96
2  57  77  86  85  75  13  57
3  32  28  59  62  54  61  31
4  22  87  80  44  14  74  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. While finding a perfectly envy-free allocation can be difficult, we can aim for a distribution that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible given the constraints.

First, let's analyze the total valuations each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0: 42 + 25 + 37 + 39 + 92 + 72 + 12 = 319
- Agent 1: 53 + 43 + 0 + 22 + 71 + 20 + 96 = 305
- Agent 2: 57 + 77 + 86 + 85 + 75 + 13 + 57 = 450
- Agent 3: 32 + 28 + 59 + 62 + 54 + 61 + 31 = 327
- Agent 4: 22 + 87 + 80 + 44 + 14 + 74 + 95 = 416

The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations. To do this, we can try to allocate items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 4** highly values item 1 (87) and item 6 (95). We allocate these items to Agent 4.
2. **Agent 2** values item 2 (86) and item 3 (85) the most. We allocate these items to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** values item 4 (92) the most, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 1** values item 6 (96) the most, but it's already allocated to Agent 4. The next high-value item is 0 (53), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 3** is left, and we allocate item 5 (61) to Agent 3, which they value reasonably well.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Items 1, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and aims to minimize envy based on their highest valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 7 items among the 5 agents and respects the constraints and valuations as much as possible.
