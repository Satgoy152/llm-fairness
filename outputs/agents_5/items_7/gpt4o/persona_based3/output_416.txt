Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  67  72  65  58  71  56  78
1  42  64  81  98  80  61  11
2  83  46   1  27  82  49  56
3  91  81  83  30  55  32   0
4  57  76  48  55  82  75  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent receives an integer number of items and all 7 items are allocated, we aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should feel at least as happy with their allocation as with any other allocation given their valuation.

The valuations are:

```
Agent 0: [67, 72, 65, 58, 71, 56, 78]
Agent 1: [42, 64, 81, 98, 80, 61, 11]
Agent 2: [83, 46, 1, 27, 82, 49, 56]
Agent 3: [91, 81, 83, 30, 55, 32, 0]
Agent 4: [57, 76, 48, 55, 82, 75, 95]
```

To allocate these items fairly, we need to consider the preferences of each agent and try to distribute the items such that no agent envies another. Given the complexity of finding a perfect envy-free allocation, we aim to minimize envy and distribute items based on valuations.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest (91), so assign item 0 to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the highest (98), so assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 4** values item 6 the highest (95), so assign item 6 to Agent 4.
4. **Agent 0** values item 4 the second highest (71), so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 2** values item 5 the second highest (49), so assign item 5 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 0** values item 1 third highest (72), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 2** values item 2 third highest (1), so assign item 2 to Agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they highly value, thus minimizing envy. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6]
}
```

Each agent receives items based on their preferences to ensure a fair distribution.
