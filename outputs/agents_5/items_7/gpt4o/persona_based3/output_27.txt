Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  87  72  17  53  21  53
1  96  75   3  18  58   7  84
2  87  57  28  13   1  53  25
3  79  72  39  24  72  97  90
4  56   2  85   3  78  29  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll start by examining the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received a fair share given their perceived value of the items.

Here are the valuations of the agents for each item:

- Agent 0: [58, 87, 72, 17, 53, 21, 53]
- Agent 1: [96, 75, 3, 18, 58, 7, 84]
- Agent 2: [87, 57, 28, 13, 1, 53, 25]
- Agent 3: [79, 72, 39, 24, 72, 97, 90]
- Agent 4: [56, 2, 85, 3, 78, 29, 93]

An approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a method like the "round-robin" allocation (also known as sequential allocation), where each agent takes turns choosing their most valued item that hasn't been allocated yet. This helps in reducing envy as each agent is given the opportunity to choose their preferred available item.

Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 87).
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 96).
   - Agent 2 picks item 0 (already taken), so picks item 1 (value 57).
   - Agent 3 picks item 5 (value 97).
   - Agent 4 picks item 6 (value 93).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 72).
   - Agent 1 picks item 6 (already taken), so picks item 4 (value 58).
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (already taken), so picks item 2 (value 28).
   - Agent 3 picks item 6 (already taken), so picks item 4 (value 72).
   - Agent 4 picks item 2 (already taken), so picks item 4 (already taken), then picks item 3 (value 3).

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 0 (already taken), so picks item 4 (already taken), then picks item 3 (already taken), then picks item 5 (value 21).
   - Agent 1 picks item 6 (already taken), then picks item 5 (already taken), then picks item 3 (already taken).

4. **Final Allocation:**

Based on the above sequence while ensuring each agent gets their turn, the final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6, 3]
}
```

Please note that this allocation might not perfectly satisfy the envy-freeness for every agent, but it attempts to balance their preferences based on their highest available choices.
