Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  44  79  86  50  43  96  33
1  63  13  93  59  22  30  55
2  27  54  54  83  41  28  74
3  23  88  10   4  48  87  59
4  92  94  15  91  59  92  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations, we can use the envy-free mechanism for discrete fair division. A common approach is to use a round-robin algorithm where agents take turns picking the most valued item that is still available. This can lead to a fair distribution where no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 4**: Has the highest single valuation (94 for item 1), so they pick item 1.
2. **Agent 0**: Next highest valuation is 96 for item 5, so they pick item 5.
3. **Agent 1**: Next highest valuation is 93 for item 2, so they pick item 2.
4. **Agent 2**: Next highest valuation is 83 for item 3, so they pick item 3.
5. **Agent 3**: Next highest valuation is 88 for item 1, but it's taken. The next highest available is 87 for item 5, but it's also taken. The next available highest is 59 for item 6, so they pick item 6.
6. **Agent 4**: The next highest available valuation is 92 for item 0, so they pick item 0.
7. **Agent 0**: The remaining item with the highest valuation for agent 0 is item 4 with a valuation of 43, so they pick item 4.

After the allocation, each agent has picked according to their preferences, and all items have been allocated. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 0]
}
```
