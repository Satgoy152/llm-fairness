Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  33  70  85  75  17  14  90
1  23  34  29  29  98   6  39
2  40  84  86  98  20  39  65
3  40  33  72  87  25   9  10
4  72  70  44  10  62  34  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible, given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider agents' valuations and try to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Key Valuations**: Review the valuation matrix to identify high-value items for each agent.
2. **Distribute High-Value Items**: Aim to give each agent at least one item they highly value.
3. **Balance Remaining Items**: Distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuations each agent receives.

Let's begin the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 2 and 6. We can assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values items 3 and 2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 doesn't have standout high valuations, but item 1 is reasonably high. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 out of the 7 items. Next, we distribute the remaining items (items 2 and 5) considering the remaining valuations:

- Item 2 has the highest valuation for Agent 2. Since Agent 2 has one item already, we should ensure fairness. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Item 5 has a reasonable valuation for Agent 0. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

This allocation aims to approximate fairness by considering high individual valuations and distributing remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and a total of 7 items are allocated.
