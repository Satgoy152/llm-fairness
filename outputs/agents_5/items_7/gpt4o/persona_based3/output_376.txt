Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  23  57  44  60  28  96  86
1  81  24   1  16  98  96   8
2  23  28  96  68   9  64  11
3  24  48  87  98  97  99  52
4  62  63  32  99  50  88  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the 5 agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free and considers the valuations each agent has for the items. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's analyze the problem and proceed with an allocation strategy:

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Initial Analysis**: 
   - Each agent has unique valuations for each item.
   - The goal is to distribute 7 items among 5 agents.

2. **Fair Division Approach**:
   - We will attempt to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes each agent's total value based on their preferences.
   - We will also ensure that no agent envies another by considering the agents' preferences when allocating items.

3. **Allocation Process**:
   - Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most and proceed with other items in order of descending preference, ensuring no two agents are allocated the same item.

#### Allocation:
- **Agent 0** values item 5 the highest (96).
- **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (98).
- **Agent 2** values item 2 the highest (96).
- **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest (99), but it's already taken, so give them the next highest valued item, item 3 (98).
- **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest (99), but it's already taken, so give them the next highest valued item, item 5 (88).

4. **Remaining Items**:
   - After satisfying the highest preferences, we distribute the remaining items considering the agents' next highest preferences and ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

#### Final Allocation:
- Assign the remaining items to balance the number of items each agent receives while considering their preferences.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 6, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they highly value, thus minimizing envy among agents while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items.
