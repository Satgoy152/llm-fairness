Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  78   5  64  28  18  18  22
1  60  36  56  80  96  60   6
2  51  96  92  51  39   9  39
3  28  25  89  75  41  18   3
4  13  87   6  75  40  23   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 5 agents, we aim to achieve an allocation where each agent's share is envy-free or as close as possible to envy-free given the constraints. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own.

Let's consider the valuations and attempt to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Has the highest valuation for item 0 (78).
  
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Has the highest valuation for items 4 (96) and 3 (80).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Has the highest valuation for item 1 (96) and high valuation for item 2 (92).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Has a high valuation for item 2 (89) and 3 (75).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Has a high valuation for item 1 (87) and 3 (75).

To create a fair allocation:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
- Since Agent 1 and Agent 2 have strong preferences for multiple items, we need to consider the remaining items:
  - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
  - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

This allocation considers each agent's top preferences while also balancing the total number of items each agent receives. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```
