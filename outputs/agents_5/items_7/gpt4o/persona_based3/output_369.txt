Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  14  93   1  32   5  38
1  86  80  68  90  82  98  89
2   7  25  70   5  86  68  79
3  24  77  15  18  18  78  87
4  64   0  43  59  22  70  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem while considering envy-freeness, we need to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We must allocate all 7 items, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a potential allocation that aims to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0** values items 0, 2, and 4 the most. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has consistently high valuations across most items. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values items 1 and 6 highly. Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 highly, but it's already allocated. Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

To ensure all items are allocated correctly and each agent receives at least one item:

- **Agent 0** receives items 2 and 0 (second highest).
- **Agent 1** receives items 5 and 1.
- **Agent 2** receives item 4.
- **Agent 3** receives item 6.
- **Agent 4** receives item 3.

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items based on the highest valuations of each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.
