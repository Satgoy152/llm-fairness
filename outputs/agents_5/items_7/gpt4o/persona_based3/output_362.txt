Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  75  92  59  15  74  95  29
1  51  64  27  38  56  73  32
2  32  39  12  24  40  13  30
3  44  53  11  55  42  47  95
4  65  17  84  61   3  20  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use methods from fair division and envy-freeness, such as the Envy-Free up to One Item (EF1) allocation. An EF1 allocation ensures that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation, up to the removal of a single item.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieving this:

1. **Initial Considerations**: 
   - Total items: 7
   - Total agents: 5
   - Each agent should ideally get either 1 or 2 items to ensure all items are allocated.

2. **Valuation Matrix**:
   - Agent 0: [75, 92, 59, 15, 74, 95, 29]
   - Agent 1: [51, 64, 27, 38, 56, 73, 32]
   - Agent 2: [32, 39, 12, 24, 40, 13, 30]
   - Agent 3: [44, 53, 11, 55, 42, 47, 95]
   - Agent 4: [65, 17, 84, 61, 3, 20, 11]

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign items based on the highest value each agent gives an item, ensuring that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while considering the need to balance allocations across agents.
   - Adjust the allocations to ensure each agent receives at least one item and no agent receives more than two items.

4. **Allocate Items**:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (95), so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 (64) and item 5 (73), since item 5 is taken, allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (40), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (95), so allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (84), so allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

5. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items: 0, 3
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (second highest value).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (second highest value).

Final Allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, the total number of items allocated is 7, and the allocation is close to envy-free up to one item.
