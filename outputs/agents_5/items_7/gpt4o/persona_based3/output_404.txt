Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  54  20  68  99  93  59  73
1  64  59  69  93  23  52  72
2  11  33  16  65  50  54  52
3  11  24  80  94  44  83  61
4  99  44  67  95  18  90  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent. The goal is to distribute the items such that envy is minimized and each agent receives an integer number of items. This often involves ensuring that each agent's perceived value of their assigned items is as high as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (99). We'll assign item 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: After removing item 3, Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 0 (64). We'll assign item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: With items 0 and 3 removed, Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (54). We'll assign item 5 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: With items 0, 3, and 5 removed, Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 2 (80). We'll assign item 2 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: With items 0, 2, 3, and 5 removed, Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 6 (87). We'll assign item 6 to agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

6. **Agent 1**: With items 0, 2, 3, 5, and 6 removed, Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (59). We'll assign item 1 to agent 1.

7. **Agent 4**: With items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 removed, Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 4 (18). We'll assign item 4 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the overall allocation is fairly distributed based on valuations. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the perceived value for each agent and distributes the items in a manner that aligns with their preferences, thus minimizing envy.
