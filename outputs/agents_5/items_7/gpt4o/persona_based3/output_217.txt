Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  97  30  58  83  79  45  77
1  45  41  60  15  70  95  13
2  84  81  53  31  59  32  50
3  93  91   3  27  32  65  64
4   2  80  28  49  26   3  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in such a way that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own based on their valuations.

The goal is to distribute the 7 items among the 5 agents, ideally taking into account their preferences, and ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (97) among all agents, so we can start by giving item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (95), so we assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (84), but it's already taken, so we give them their next highest valued item, which is item 1 (81).
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (93), but it's taken, so we assign their next highest valued item, item 1 (91), but that is also taken. We give them their next highest valued item, which is item 5 (65), but that is also taken. So, we give them item 3 (27).
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (82), so we allocate item 6 to agent 4.

Now, we have assigned 5 items: 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6.

We still need to assign items 2 and 4:

6. Agent 0 also values item 4 highly (79), so we assign item 4 to agent 0.
7. Finally, agent 2, who has received only one item so far, values item 2 (53) reasonably high, so we assign item 2 to agent 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6]
}
```
