Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  76  43  38  82  31  25  99
1  48  23   9  61  84   5  10
2  69  11  24  42  36  66  52
3  70  43  12   3  18  83  64
4  51  52  11  11   5   8  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while focusing on envy-freeness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use the maximum valuations each agent has for the items as a guiding principle. Our goal is to minimize envy, which means that each agent should ideally feel they received a fair share in comparison to others, based on their own valuations.

Given the valuation matrix:

```
0: [76, 43, 38, 82, 31, 25, 99]
1: [48, 23, 9, 61, 84, 5, 10]
2: [69, 11, 24, 42, 36, 66, 52]
3: [70, 43, 12, 3, 18, 83, 64]
4: [51, 52, 11, 11, 5, 8, 15]
```

Let's break down the items allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 6 (value 99). We assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (value 84). We assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 5 (value 66). We assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (value 83) and item 0 (value 70), but item 5 is already allocated. Thus, we assign item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 1 (value 52). We assign item 1 to agent 4.

At this point, we have allocated items 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6. We have two more items to allocate: 2 and 3.

6. **Agent 0** has the highest remaining valuation for item 3 (value 82). We assign item 3 to agent 0.
7. **Agent 3** can take item 2, which has a relatively higher valuation than what it remaining for others (value 12 is not high but strategically, it fits).

Hereâ€™s the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's top valuations and minimize envy by distributing items based on individual preferences.
