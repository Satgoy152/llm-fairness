Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  73  20  63  94  71  24  36
1  24  51  67  94  56  54  33
2  90  70  13  39  45  67  30
3  11  93  55   4  76  81  93
4  14   5  83  51  47  75  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to satisfy certain fairness criteria such as envy-freeness and efficiency. A common method is to use an algorithm like the "Envy-Free Matching" or modified versions of the "Round Robin" allocation process, but given the constraints (integer allocations and only 7 items), we'll focus on ensuring that no agent envies another after allocation.

Here's the approach:

1. **Initialization**: Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items and use this to guide allocations.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes satisfaction and reduces potential envy. We'll do this by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring that no agent is significantly disadvantaged.

3. **Final Check**: Ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [73, 20, 63, 94, 71, 24, 36]
Agent 1: [24, 51, 67, 94, 56, 54, 33]
Agent 2: [90, 70, 13, 39, 45, 67, 30]
Agent 3: [11, 93, 55, 4, 76, 81, 93]
Agent 4: [14, 5, 83, 51, 47, 75, 54]
```

**Proposed Allocation**:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (value 94, highest for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (value 67) and Item 4 (value 56)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (value 90, highest for agent 2)
- Agent 3: Item 5 (value 81)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (value 5) and Item 6 (value 54)

This allocation tries to balance high-value assignments across agents while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's how the allocation looks in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```
