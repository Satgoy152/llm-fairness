Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  40  96  15   0   3   6  55
1  88  92  61  81  20  92  24
2  60  15  71  87  83  84  91
3  83  30  96  22  20  19  23
4  23  74  38  91  74  72  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent prefers their own bundle of items over any other agent's bundle. Given the valuations, we can attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items they value highly. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: 
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This is a greedy approach to start with.

2. **Adjustment for Fairness**:
   - Check if any agent is envious of another agent's allocation.
   - If any agent is envious, attempt to swap items between the agents to reduce envy or make trade-offs.

3. **Final Adjustments**:
   - Iterate through the allocations to ensure all items are allocated and no agent remains envious if possible.

Let's apply this strategy to the given valuations:

### Initial Greedy Allocation:
- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (88)
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (96)
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most (96)
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most (91)
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (83)
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (92)
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (91)

### Adjusting for Fairness:
- Agent 1 has items 0 and 5; try to balance the count per agent.
- Agent 2 has items 4 and 6; try to balance the count per agent.
- Swap items or adjust to ensure each agent has at least one item and reduce possible envy.

### Final Allocation:
We aim to distribute items such that each agent receives at least one item if possible and no agent is envious. The result may not be perfectly envy-free due to the discrete nature of the problem but should aim to minimize large disparities.

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives one or more items, with an attempt to align the distribution with their preferences as closely as possible.
