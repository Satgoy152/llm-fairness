Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  18  31  49  15  83  97  30
1  52  82  63  54   5  17  26
2  74  73  25  26   4  19  21
3  64  48  99  13  10  66  52
4  73  21  96  26  47  74   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items in such a way that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent feels that they have received a fair share according to their valuations. This involves considering the values each agent places on each item and trying to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

Given the valuations provided, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Has high valuations for item 4 (83) and item 5 (97). 
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Prefers item 1 (82).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Has a high valuation for item 0 (74).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highly values item 2 (99).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Prefers item 3 (26) and item 6 (3).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, distribute remaining items considering remaining valuations:

- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most (83), but Agent 4 can also be considered as it has a significant valuation (47) and hasn't yet received a highly valued item.
  - Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

- **Item 6**: The remaining item can be assigned to Agent 3 as they have a reasonable valuation (52) for it.
  - Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

Letâ€™s summarize the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while trying to maintain a balance in perceived value among agents.
