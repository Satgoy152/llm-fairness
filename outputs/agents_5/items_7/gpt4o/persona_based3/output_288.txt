Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  88  70  22  99  44  19  72
1  66  18  17  54  27  70  38
2  23  57  33  44  75  87  19
3  15  69  28  96  75  60  18
4  80  16  95  25  31  53  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. A common approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) method, which balances between efficiency and fairness. The MNW method involves maximizing the product of the utilities (valuations) of the allocations for each agent. 

Let's proceed with this allocation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

### Valuations Matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 88     | 70     | 22     | 99     | 44     | 19     | 72     |
| 1     | 66     | 18     | 17     | 54     | 27     | 70     | 38     |
| 2     | 23     | 57     | 33     | 44     | 75     | 87     | 19     |
| 3     | 15     | 69     | 28     | 96     | 75     | 60     | 18     |
| 4     | 80     | 16     | 95     | 25     | 31     | 53     | 60     |

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Agent 0 values item 3 highly.
   - Agent 4 values item 2 highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 highly.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (high value).
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (moderately high value).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (moderately high value).
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (moderately high value).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their highest valuations, aiming to minimize envy among agents.
