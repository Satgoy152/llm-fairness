Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  74  79  78   2  12  42  75
1  44  50  81  72  90  27  61
2  34  37  39  79   1  49  18
3  64  27  58  44  60  87  34
4  96  95  34  64  24   0  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among agents based on their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items in such a way that minimizes envy. Although finding an allocation that is perfectly envy-free may not always be possible, we can strive for a distribution that is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Here is a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Identify preferences:** Examine the valuation matrix to determine which items are most valued by each agent.

2. **Initial assignment:** Begin by attempting to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust for fairness:** Check for any obvious conflicts where an agent might receive items that others value significantly more. If so, consider reassigning those items to achieve a more balanced distribution.

4. **Check totals and adjust if necessary:** Ensure that exactly 7 items are distributed, with each agent receiving whole items, and adjust as necessary to meet the requirement.

Following this approach, here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Receives item 0 and item 6, both of which they value highly.
- **Agent 1:** Receives item 4, which is their highest-valued item.
- **Agent 2:** Receives item 3, their highest-valued item.
- **Agent 3:** Receives item 5.
- **Agent 4:** Receives items 1 and 2, which are among their higher-valued items.

This allocation attempts to give each agent some of their preferred items while ensuring all items are allocated.

{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```
