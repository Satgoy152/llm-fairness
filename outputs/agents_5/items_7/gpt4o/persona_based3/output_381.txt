Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86   4  96  57  26  71  56
1   2  52  99  22  71  59  16
2  83  61  54  64  48  18  23
3  47  82  13  86  91   9  99
4   9  78  99  29  70  53  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation based on the given valuations and ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a common fair division algorithm such as the round-robin method, which assigns items to agents in a turn-based manner, prioritizing their highest valued items while ensuring that each agent gets a similar number of items over multiple rounds.

The valuations for each agent are:

- Agent 0: [86, 4, 96, 57, 26, 71, 56]
- Agent 1: [2, 52, 99, 22, 71, 59, 16]
- Agent 2: [83, 61, 54, 64, 48, 18, 23]
- Agent 3: [47, 82, 13, 86, 91, 9, 99]
- Agent 4: [9, 78, 99, 29, 70, 53, 60]

We will allocate the items to each agent in a way that attempts to maximize their overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given there are 7 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

### Allocation Process:

1. **First Round (Highest Valuation item per agent):**
   - Agent 0 chooses item 2 (value 96).
   - Agent 1 chooses item 2 (value 99) but it is already taken, so chooses item 4 (value 71).
   - Agent 2 chooses item 0 (value 83).
   - Agent 3 chooses item 6 (value 99).
   - Agent 4 chooses item 2 (value 99) but it is already taken, so chooses item 1 (value 78).

2. **Second Round (Next Highest Available Valuation):**
   - Agent 0 chooses item 5 (value 71).
   - Agent 1 chooses item 3 (value 22).
   - Agent 2 chooses item 3 (value 64) but it is already taken, so chooses item 1 (value 61).
   - Agent 3 already received an item in the first round.
   - Agent 4 already received an item in the first round.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item (except agent 4, who ends up with no items due to their lower valuations), and the total number of items allocated is 7, as required.
