Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   0  22  79   7  22  29  38
1  66  69  10  99  16  29  69
2  94  28  65  75  79  65  96
3  26  45  68  63  50  18   0
4  10  45   5  76  47  40  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle. Given the table of valuations for 7 items and 5 agents, we will consider the values each agent assigns to the items to distribute them as fairly as possible.

First, let's examine the valuations:

```
Valuations:
Agent 0: [0, 22, 79, 7, 22, 29, 38]
Agent 1: [66, 69, 10, 99, 16, 29, 69]
Agent 2: [94, 28, 65, 75, 79, 65, 96]
Agent 3: [26, 45, 68, 63, 50, 18, 0]
Agent 4: [10, 45, 5, 76, 47, 40, 88]
```

To allocate the items, we look for a distribution where each agent gets at least one item and no agent envies another. Let's attempt a distribution:

- Agent 0 values Item 2 highly, so we allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values Item 3, so we allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for Item 6, so we allocate Item 6 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values Item 4 the most, so we allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 highly values Item 5, so we allocate Item 5 to Agent 4.

We have now allocated 5 items, so two more need to be distributed among these agents. Let's look for the next highest items:

- Agent 0 can also be satisfied with Item 1.
- Agent 2 values Item 0 highly, so we allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, all items are allocated, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.
