Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  24  19  98  16  86  93  51
1  50  65  13  37  22  75  75
2  82  82  25  75  49  76  17
3  20  85  10  42  43  84   0
4  47  49  67  33  85  13  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility while ensuring some degree of fairness. One approach is to apply the "round robin" method, where each agent picks their most valued item one by one until all items are allocated. This approach attempts to ensure envy-freeness to some extent.

Let's calculate the allocations step-by-step using a round robin approach:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 2 (value 98)
2. **Agent 1** picks item 5 (value 75)
3. **Agent 2** picks item 0 (value 82)
4. **Agent 3** picks item 1 (value 85)
5. **Agent 4** picks item 4 (value 85)
6. **Agent 0** picks item 6 (value 51)
7. **Agent 1** picks item 3 (value 37)

Now, every agent has had the opportunity to pick items in a sequential manner, and all 7 items have been allocated.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and no items are left unallocated.
