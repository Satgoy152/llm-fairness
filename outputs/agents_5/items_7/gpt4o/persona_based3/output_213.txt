Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  32  62  88  79  92  42  11
1  12  29  51  89  82  55  80
2  43  94  34  54   9  68  76
3  22  73  86  65  51  71   0
4   6  12  38  67  45  16  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving strict envy-freeness may not always be possible, particularly with a small number of items and agents. Therefore, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Given the valuations, we can start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Let's proceed:

1. **Agent 0**: Their highest valuation is for item 4 (92). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Their highest valuation is for item 3 (89). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Their highest valuation is for item 1 (94). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Their highest valuation is for item 2 (86). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Their highest valuation is for item 6 (96). Assign item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated the following items: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6. Items 0 and 5 are unallocated. We need to allocate these remaining items while considering the next highest valuations and ensuring that no agent is left without an item if possible.

6. **Item 0**: The next highest valuation for item 0 is by Agent 2 (43). However, Agent 2 already has item 1, which they value higher. The next highest valuation is by Agent 0 (32). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
7. **Item 5**: The highest valuation for item 5 among the remaining unallocated agents is by Agent 2 (68). However, Agent 2 already has item 1 and has a higher total valuation with the current allocation. The next choice would be Agent 3 (71). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

The allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 2, 5
- Agent 4: Item 6

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and aims to minimize envy based on their highest valuations. The final allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [6]
}
```
