Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  98  39  15  66  44  16  27
1  66  63  90   3  93  94  20
2  78  23  90  26  99   6  43
3  92  68  80  36  94  59  73
4  73  24  88  43  41  73  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. That is, each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, according to their own valuations.

Given the complexity of the problem and the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items, we can use a simple heuristic approach to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations. A common approach is to use a greedy method where each agent is sequentially assigned their most valued unallocated item until all items are distributed.

Below is one possible allocation that aims to be envy-free, although perfect envy-freeness is not guaranteed due to the constraints:

1. **Agent 0** values item 0 the most (value 98), so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the most (value 94), so assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (value 99), so assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most, but since it's already taken, assign item 0 to Agent 3, which is second highest (value 92), followed by item 3 (value 36).
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 the most (value 88), so assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Continue this process considering each agent's next highest valued item while ensuring that each item is assigned only once.

After executing this process, we arrive at the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 6.
- Agent 4 gets items 2 and 3.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed with some consideration of the agents' preferences.
