Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  31  35  27  98  31  67  52
1  43  86  35  40  69  68  23
2  48  96  11  77  48  59  49
3  70  86  90  89  60  75  20
4  84  90  14  25  73  45   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness is a challenging problem, especially when agents have different valuations for items. Here, we'll aim for a fair division by considering both the individual valuations and trying to minimize envy.

We can use an algorithm like the "round-robin" to distribute items, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued available item. However, achieving envy-freeness might not be possible in all cases, but we will provide an allocation that aims to be as fair as possible.

First, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (98).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (86).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (96).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (90).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most (90).

The goal is to distribute these items fairly among the agents. A structured approach is needed to ensure each agent gets items they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 7.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. Start with each agent getting their most valued item that hasn't been taken by another agent.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives, aiming to minimize envy.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Gets items 3 (98) and 6 (52).
- **Agent 1:** Gets items 1 (86) and 0 (43).
- **Agent 2:** Gets item 5 (59).
- **Agent 3:** Gets item 2 (90).
- **Agent 4:** Gets item 4 (73).

This allocation aims to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each item is distributed. It may not be perfectly envy-free, as true envy-freeness can be challenging with integer constraints and uneven valuations, but it strives for fairness.

**JSON Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 7 items are distributed among the 5 agents.
