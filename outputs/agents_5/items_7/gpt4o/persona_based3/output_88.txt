Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  21  93   7  88  21  50  71
1  69  50  55   9  83  17  51
2  28  82  52   5  53  81  46
3  84  23   9  67  65   6  54
4  40  61  34   6  54  93  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their individual valuations. Here's one possible approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: First, compute the total valuation each agent has over all items to understand how much each agent values the entire set of items.

2. **Priority Based on Valuations**: Assign items to agents based on their preferences. Starting with the agent with the highest total valuation, allocate the item they value the most that hasn't been allocated yet. Repeat this process for each agent.

3. **Iterate and Assign**: Continue assigning items in rounds, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, while minimizing envy.

4. **Check for Envy-freeness**: Adjust allocations if any agent envies another agent's allocation.

Using this method, here is a suggested allocation that seeks to minimize envy:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Agent 0 receives item 1, which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 1 receives item 4, which is highly valued by them.
- Agent 2 receives item 5, which is highly valued.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 3, which are among the higher valued items for them.
- Agent 4 receives items 2 and 6, which are also highly valued by them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items close to their preferences while distributing the items fairly among all agents.
