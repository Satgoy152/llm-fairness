Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  83  73  84  37  20   4  31
1  36  28  46  26   2  55  36
2   5  52  87  93  13  45  83
3  79  69  13  57  24  22  12
4  70  18  35  41  90  12  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items so that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share according to their own valuations. Here's one approach to achieve that:

First, we will calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and try to distribute items such that each agent gets high value items according to their preferences.

Let's sum up the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(83 + 73 + 84 + 37 + 20 + 4 + 31 = 332\)
- Agent 1: \(36 + 28 + 46 + 26 + 2 + 55 + 36 = 229\)
- Agent 2: \(5 + 52 + 87 + 93 + 13 + 45 + 83 = 378\)
- Agent 3: \(79 + 69 + 13 + 57 + 24 + 22 + 12 = 276\)
- Agent 4: \(70 + 18 + 35 + 41 + 90 + 12 + 76 = 342\)

Next, we allocate the items to the agents in a way that maximizes their valuations and attempts to ensure fairness:

1. Identify the item each agent values the most.
2. Allocate these items if there is no conflict. If multiple agents value the same item the most, resolve conflicts by moving to the next highest-valued item for the agent.

Here is a fair allocation based on the above valuations:

- Agent 0: [0] (value 83)
- Agent 1: [5] (value 55)
- Agent 2: [2, 3] (values 87, 93)
- Agent 3: [1] (value 69)
- Agent 4: [4, 6] (values 90, 76)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item they highly value, while ensuring each item is allocated once.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
