Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  86   8  14  10  19  52  93
1  46  56  64   4  29  33  14
2  16  19  16  83  68  45  19
3  11  91  10  93  29  37  21
4  82  30  75  41  66  91  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [82 30 75 41 66 91 60]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Considering agent 0's highest valuation, item 6 is highly valued at 93. Allocating item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 2 at 64. Allocating item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 at 83. Allocating item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 at 91 and item 3 at 93. Since item 3 is already taken, allocating item 1 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 highly values item 5 at 91. Allocating item 5 to agent 4.

At this point, each agent has been allocated one item. The remaining items, 0 and 4, need to be allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 is valued at 86 by agent 0. Allocating item 0 to agent 0.
- **Agent 4**: Item 4 is highly valued at 66 by agent 4. Allocating item 4 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 4]
}
```
