Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  59  71  43  34  68   4  59
1  63  25   2  99  95  22  95
2  42  32  14  59  15  67  21
3   3  69  25  92  66   7  49
4  41  98  18  38  41  43   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our goal is to make the allocation as envy-free as possible, though with integer allocations and more agents than items, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible. However, we can attempt to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items that they value highly relative to the other agents.

Given the valuations, we can try to allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly at 71, and item 0 at 59. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation of 99 for item 3 and also values item 4 at 95. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the highest at 67. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly (92), but it's already taken, so we consider their next highest, item 1, but it's also taken. Their next highest is item 4 at 66, but Agent 1 also highly values item 4. Let's give item 4 to Agent 3 since Agent 1 already has item 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 the highest (98), but it's taken by Agent 0. Their next highest is item 0 at 41. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, items 2 and 6 remain unallocated. We need to allocate these items to the agents who have either lesser allocations or who value them reasonably:

- **Agent 2** has only one item and values item 6 next highest at 21. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 4** has only one item and values item 2 at 18. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
