Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  71   0  96  16  17  52
1  79  87  43  49  79  10  59
2  63  91  32  31  61  33  73
3  81  46  36  43  10  52   3
4  21  76  32   8   3  95  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given the valuations, let's aim for an allocation where each agent feels they are getting a fair share relative to their valuations.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values items 3 and 1. Allocating these items to agent 0 maximizes their value.
   
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 0. Since item 1 is already taken, allocate items 0 and 4 to agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 the most. Allocate item 6 to agent 2. Since it only maximizes one item, we might need re-evaluation later.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 0, but since it's already allocated, we should focus on item 5, which has the next highest value.
   
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 5 the most, which is already taken. The next item they value is item 1, which is also taken. Allocating item 2 to agent 4 gives them some value.

**Re-evaluation:**

- Agent 2: This agent only has one item allocated so far. Re-evaluate their allocation to include item 6, which was already chosen, and also item 2, since itâ€™s unallocated and gives them a reasonable value.

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation, every item is allocated exactly once, and all agents have been considered in the allocation process.
