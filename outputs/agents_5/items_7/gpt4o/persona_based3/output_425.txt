Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  64  79  51  70  93  85  92
1  77  61   0  47  31   6  30
2  23  87   3   5   2  11  41
3  72  12  43  94   1  28  30
4  93  88  11  54  51  75  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free, ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the constraints, it's challenging to guarantee complete envy-freeness with integer allocations and limited items, but we can strive for an allocation that minimizes envy.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 4, 5, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 highly, but also has a reasonable valuation for item 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 highly, but not much else.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 3.
5. **Agent 4** values items 0, 1, and 6 highly.

Given these observations, we can make the following allocations:

- **Item 0** goes to Agent 4, as they value it the highest.
- **Item 1** goes to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued item by far.
- **Item 2** goes to Agent 3, as it complements their other allocations.
- **Item 3** goes to Agent 3, as they value it the highest.
- **Item 4** goes to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation for it and other high-value options are limited.
- **Item 5** goes to Agent 0, complementing their allocation for a good overall valuation.
- **Item 6** goes to Agent 4, as they have one of the highest valuations for it.

This distribution attempts to balance the agents' preferences and maximize individual satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and no agent receives more than 2 items, maintaining a sense of fairness given the constraints.
