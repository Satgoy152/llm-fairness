Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  55   7  16  94  57  51  85
1  11  70  11  12  62  15  68
2  13  58  16  68  39  17  82
3  72  56  86  42  53  20   3
4  37  58  35  64  50  37  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to achieve envy-freeness, ensuring that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we will strive for a practical approximation.

Let's consider the valuations and attempt to allocate items in a way that seems fair based on the given preferences.

Here's an allocation approach:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (94) and item 6 (85).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 1 (70) and item 4 (62).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 6 (82) and item 3 (68).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 2 (86) and item 0 (72).
5. Agent 4 doesn't have standout preferences but values item 4 (50) and item 1 (58) reasonably well.

Considering these preferences, let's make the allocations:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

For the remaining items (4 and 5):

- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (as Agent 1 values it second highest after item 1).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 has a reasonable valuation for item 5 with 51).

This allocation attempts to respect the highest preferences of each agent and distribute the remaining items to minimize envy.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
