Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  25  60  24  71  47  68  85
1  97  57  71  33  84   2   3
2  40  74  35  21  72  80  79
3  28  88  53  22  74  50   6
4  51  55  38  64  47  49  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent perceives their allocation as fair, given their individual valuations. We will use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation.

### Initial Considerations
1. **Agent Preferences**: Each agent has different valuations for each item, suggesting assignments should be made to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.
2. **Envy-Freeness**: We aim to assign items such that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

### Allocation Strategy
- Start by identifying the item that each agent values the most and try to allocate those items to them.
- Ensure that each agent receives a comparable total value of items, balancing across the agents as much as possible.
- Use a greedy approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, provided it does not significantly worsen the overall envy situation.

### Item Assignments
- **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 1 (97), but assigning to Agent 1 might create high envy due to other high-value items available. Consider Agent 4, who values it at 51.
- **Item 1**: Highest value by Agent 3 (88), assign to Agent 3.
- **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 1 (71), assign to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 0 (71), assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 1 (84), but Agent 1 already has Item 2; assign to Agent 2 with a value of 72.
- **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 2 (80), assign to Agent 2.
- **Item 6**: Highest value by Agent 0 (85), assign to Agent 0.

### Allocation Result
This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent, while minimizing envy by assigning items based on an agent's highest relative valuation.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This distribution gives each agent a high-value item based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
