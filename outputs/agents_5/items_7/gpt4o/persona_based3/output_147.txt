Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   8  44  87   7   8  32  12
1  53   6  57  67  53  10  83
2  48  96  81  33  60  27  38
3  11  12   8  95  92  69  94
4  91  27  11  68  60  81  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll try to ensure each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their valuation while considering others' preferences to ensure envy-freeness as much as possible. Below is a potential allocation:

1. **Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items** to understand the preference distribution:
   - Agent 0: \(8 + 44 + 87 + 7 + 8 + 32 + 12 = 198\)
   - Agent 1: \(53 + 6 + 57 + 67 + 53 + 10 + 83 = 329\)
   - Agent 2: \(48 + 96 + 81 + 33 + 60 + 27 + 38 = 383\)
   - Agent 3: \(11 + 12 + 8 + 95 + 92 + 69 + 94 = 381\)
   - Agent 4: \(91 + 27 + 11 + 68 + 60 + 81 + 78 = 416\)

2. **Prioritize items based on high individual valuations** to avoid envy:
   - Item 0: Highest value for Agent 4
   - Item 1: Highest value for Agent 2
   - Item 2: Highest value for Agent 0
   - Item 3: Highest value for Agent 3
   - Item 4: Highest value for Agent 3
   - Item 5: Highest value for Agent 4
   - Item 6: Highest value for Agent 1

3. **Allocate items based on these priorities**:
   - Agent 0: Item 2
   - Agent 1: Item 6
   - Agent 2: Item 1
   - Agent 3: Items 3, 4
   - Agent 4: Items 0, 5

4. **Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that each item is allocated**:
   - All items (0 to 6) are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation takes into account each agent's highest preference for specific items and distributes the items fairly, attempting to minimize envy among the agents.
