Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  37  62  85  58  89  71  29
1  72  96  57  29  38   5  94
2  66  69  48  46  73  10  87
3  80  70  25  61  38  93  67
4  49  40  14  59  44  91  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to find an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 5 agents and 7 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We will try to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocation highly.

### Step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items 4 (89), 2 (85), and 1 (62) the highest. Assign item 4, which has the highest value for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Values items 1 (96), 0 (72), and 6 (94) the highest. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, which is the highest value for them.

3. **Agent 2**: Values items 6 (87) and 4 (73) the highest, but item 4 is already taken. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values items 5 (93), 0 (80), and 3 (61) the highest. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 (91) the highest, but it is already taken. The next highest valued item is 3 (59). Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

6. **Remaining Items**: Items 0 and 2 are left. We re-evaluate the remaining agents' preferences:

   - **Agent 0**: Highest remaining value is item 2 (85).
   - **Agent 1**: Highest remaining value is item 0 (72).

Assign item 2 to Agent 0 and item 0 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive, given the constraints.
