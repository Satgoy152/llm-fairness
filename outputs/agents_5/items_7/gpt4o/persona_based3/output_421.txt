Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  46  82  84  87  75  21  17
1  76   5  12  80  76  55  86
2  71   8  85  28  94  61  38
3  92  48  25  80  90  78  90
4  44  54  38  33  43  96  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given the agents and their valuations, we'll attempt to distribute these items to maximize fairness.

Here's the approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:** First, sum up the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand the overall preference strength.

2. **Greedy Allocation:** Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** After the initial allocation, adjust to balance the allocations by moving items between agents if it reduces overall envy.

Let's perform the allocation:

### Agents' Valuations:
- **Agent 0:** Total value = 412
- **Agent 1:** Total value = 390
- **Agent 2:** Total value = 385
- **Agent 3:** Total value = 503
- **Agent 4:** Total value = 393

### Initial Greedy Allocation:
- Item 0: Agent 3 (92)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (82)
- Item 2: Agent 2 (85)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (87)
- Item 4: Agent 2 (94)
- Item 5: Agent 4 (96)
- Item 6: Agent 1 (86)

### Adjusted Allocation:
We need to adjust to ensure fairness, particularly if any agent ends up with no items:

- Agent 0: [1, 3]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [2, 4]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [5]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item while attempting to respect the highest valuations.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items and attempts to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest-valued items.
