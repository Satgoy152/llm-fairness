Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0   9  85  58  34  96  89  28
1  97   9   9  55   5  59  25
2  82  31  11   4  37   1  67
3  30  64  63   3  63  90  51
4  82  73  44  86  57  97  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness where possible, or at least minimize envy while ensuring all items are distributed. An envy-free allocation ensures each agent feels they received as good a bundle as any other agent.

Given the following valuations:

```
Agent 0: [9, 85, 58, 34, 96, 89, 28]
Agent 1: [97, 9, 9, 55, 5, 59, 25]
Agent 2: [82, 31, 11, 4, 37, 1, 67]
Agent 3: [30, 64, 63, 3, 63, 90, 51]
Agent 4: [82, 73, 44, 86, 57, 97, 55]
```

Here's a fair distribution considering the valuations, aiming to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 4, so allocate item 4.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 0, so allocate item 0.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 6, so allocate item 6.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 5, so allocate item 5.
- **Agent 4** highly values item 3, so allocate item 3.

For the remaining items, consider the next highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0** can take item 1, which they value second-highest.
- **Agent 3** can take item 2, which they value highly compared to others.

Thus, we have the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation respects the requirement of distributing all items and aims to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
