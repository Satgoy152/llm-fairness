Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  77  12  29  23  95  32  86
1  11  44  37  94  82   8  52
2  13  87  70  58   3  56  66
3  17  15  66   6  48  24  38
4  60  74  24  43  33  23   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to minimize envy among agents and ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value. Since we are dealing with discrete items, one common approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that any envy can be eliminated by removing at most one item from another agent's bundle.

Let's use a heuristic approach to assign items to agents by iteratively assigning the item that provides the most significant increase in utility to an agent who values it highly, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

### Allocation Process

1. **Initial Setup**: Identify the total value each agent assigns to all items. This will help understand the relative preferences of each agent.

2. **Iterative Allocation**:
   - At each step, allocate the item to the agent who values it the most and hasn't yet reached a fair share.
   - Ensure that no agent is left completely empty-handed if possible.

3. **Finalize**: Ensure that all items are allocated and adjust if necessary to maintain fairness.

### Allocation

Let's execute this plan and allocate the items.

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 4 (95).
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 3 (94).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 1 (87).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 2 (66).
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 0 (60).

Now we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate 2 more items.

- Item 5: Agent 2 values item 5 at 56, which is the highest remaining value.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values item 6 at 86, which is the highest remaining value.

### Final Allocation

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their valuation and attempts to balance the total value received, minimizing potential envy.
