Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  30  97  37  36  64  90
1  65  70  95  49  89  71  90
2   7  86  90  81  35  36  18
3  39  41  88  10  85  49  21
4  21  76  21  21   0  52  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an algorithm that aims to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible given that each agent receives an integer number of items. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations, the allocation can be approached by trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences for the items, while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share where possible. Here, a simple method is to allocate one item at a time to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than one item on any single pass through all items, until all items are allocated.

Here is a proposed allocation:

1. Item 2 is most valued by agent 0 (value = 97).
2. Item 3 is most valued by agent 2 (value = 81).
3. Item 5 is most valued by agent 1 (value = 71).
4. Item 1 is most valued by agent 2 (value = 86).
5. Item 6 is most valued by agent 0 (value = 90).
6. Item 4 is most valued by agent 1 (value = 89).
7. Item 0 is most valued by agent 0 (value = 66).

This allocation ensures each agent gets items that they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is 7.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [],
    "4": []
}
```

Note: This allocation aims to balance the agents' preferences as much as possible given the constraints. It may not achieve perfect envy-freeness but attempts to minimize any potential envy by distributing high-value items among different agents.
