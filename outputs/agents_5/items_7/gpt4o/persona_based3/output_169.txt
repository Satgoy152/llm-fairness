Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  82  48  28  49  31  45  91
1   4  35  16  89  57  56  90
2  74  67  39  95  24  54  13
3  69  48  56  89  79   1  47
4  57  99  41  86   5  49  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, a common approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness or to ensure that the allocation is efficient given the agents' valuations. Here, we'll aim to fairly distribute the items so that each agent has a bundle of items that is as valuable as possible given their preferences.

One approach is to use a round-robin method where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item. However, given the small number of items and agents, a direct calculation can be used to optimize the allocation based on value.

Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the highest (82) and item 6 second highest (91). They could take item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 (89) and item 6 (90) the highest. Given that item 6 is taken, they could take item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 (95) and item 0 (74) the highest. With item 3 taken, they could take item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 (89) and item 4 (79) the highest. With item 3 taken, they could take item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 (99) the highest. They could take item 1.

This leaves items 2 and 5. These can be assigned based on the remaining highest values.

- **Item 2**: Has the highest remaining value for Agent 3 (56).
- **Item 5**: Has the highest remaining value for Agent 1 (56).

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4
- Agent 4: Item 1

Here's the JSON formatted allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible and ensures that each agent receives at least one item.
