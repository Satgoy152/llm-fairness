Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  58  78  14  36  47  15  69
1  22  40  46  37  77  38  89
2  67  50   3   8  97  43  86
3  12  94  79  83   1  72  47
4  53  50  78   8  20  87  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the 7 items among the 5 agents in a way that is as fair as possible, we should aim to create an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own.

Hereâ€™s one possible approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate the items to agents such that the sum of valuations for the items each agent receives is as balanced as possible.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, to distribute items evenly.

Let's first calculate total valuations for each agent:
- Agent 0: 58 + 78 + 14 + 36 + 47 + 15 + 69 = 317
- Agent 1: 22 + 40 + 46 + 37 + 77 + 38 + 89 = 349
- Agent 2: 67 + 50 + 3 + 8 + 97 + 43 + 86 = 354
- Agent 3: 12 + 94 + 79 + 83 + 1 + 72 + 47 = 388
- Agent 4: 53 + 50 + 78 + 8 + 20 + 87 + 86 = 382

Now let's try to allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value of 67 for Agent 2).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value of 94 for Agent 3).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (value of 78 for Agent 4).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (value of 83 for Agent 3).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value of 77 for Agent 1).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (value of 87 for Agent 4).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value of 69 for Agent 0).

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives items. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation is not strictly envy-free, but it attempts to balance the allocation as fairly as possible given the constraints.
