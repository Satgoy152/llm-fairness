Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  51  96  24  82  79  54  31
1  97  40  42  55  59  57  48
2  84  80  84  97   9  16  31
3  75  79  19  48  50  15  61
4  87  76  29  49  60  88  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should believe they received a fair share based on their individual valuations. Given the constraints and the table of valuations, we can use the method of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is the product of utilities, to guide the allocation process.

First, we calculate the total value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: 51 + 96 + 24 + 82 + 79 + 54 + 31 = 417
- Agent 1: 97 + 40 + 42 + 55 + 59 + 57 + 48 = 398
- Agent 2: 84 + 80 + 84 + 97 + 9 + 16 + 31 = 401
- Agent 3: 75 + 79 + 19 + 48 + 50 + 15 + 61 = 347
- Agent 4: 87 + 76 + 29 + 49 + 60 + 88 + 49 = 438

We aim to distribute the items to maximize the minimum satisfaction, keeping agents' preferences in mind. 

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4]
  - Total value: 96 + 79 = 175
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2]
  - Total value: 97 + 42 = 139
- Agent 2: Item [3]
  - Total value: 97
- Agent 3: Items [6]
  - Total value: 61
- Agent 4: Items [5]
  - Total value: 88

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on high individual valuations while ensuring all items are allocated. Each agent receives items that maximize their utility based on the given constraints. 

Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5]
}
```
