Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  66  31  13  75  70  50  71
1  97  34  61  83  66  29  28
2  87  32  70   1  51  84  91
3   2  71   3  41  72  53  62
4  14  58  91  24  13  22  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy among the agents, we will aim to allocate items based on their individual valuations. The goal is to ensure a fair distribution of value rather than just a distribution of an equal number of items. However, given the constraints of integer allocations, we will balance these considerations.

Let's first analyze the total valuation of each agent to get an idea of their preferences:

- Agent 0: 66 + 31 + 13 + 75 + 70 + 50 + 71 = 376
- Agent 1: 97 + 34 + 61 + 83 + 66 + 29 + 28 = 398
- Agent 2: 87 + 32 + 70 + 1 + 51 + 84 + 91 = 416
- Agent 3: 2 + 71 + 3 + 41 + 72 + 53 + 62 = 304
- Agent 4: 14 + 58 + 91 + 24 + 13 + 22 + 77 = 299

Now, let's proceed to allocate the items, attempting to maximize each agent's satisfaction and ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible.

1. **Agent 1** has the highest total valuation, and they value item 0 (97) the most. We'll allocate item 0 to them.
2. **Agent 2** has the next highest total valuation, and they value item 6 (91) the most. We'll allocate item 6 to them.
3. **Agent 0** values item 3 (75) the most. We'll allocate item 3 to them.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 (72) the most. We'll allocate item 4 to them.
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 (91) the most. We'll allocate item 2 to them.
6. **Agent 0** has the next highest remaining valuation for item 1 (31). We'll allocate item 1 to them.
7. **Agent 2** values item 5 (84) highly. We'll allocate item 5 to them.

The proposed allocation aims to give each agent items they value highly to ensure a fair distribution based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value significantly, minimizing potential envy and creating a fair distribution of the total valuation.
