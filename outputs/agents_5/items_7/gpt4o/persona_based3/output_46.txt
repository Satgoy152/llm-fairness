Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  30  60  99  40  58  49  76
1  28   0  20  50  16  16  34
2  64  56   2  82  18  14  32
3  31  89   2  98   7  89  40
4  45  48  13  23  51  17  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to give each agent at least one item, if possible, and try to maximize their satisfaction by considering their highest-valued items first.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value 99)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value 50)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (value 64)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value 98), already taken.
   - Next highest value item: Item 1 (value 89)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (value 51)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. Two items remain: Item 5 and Item 6.

6. **Unallocated Items**:
   - **Item 5**: 
     - Highest value for remaining agents: Agent 3 (value 89), already has item.
     - Next highest: Agent 0 (value 49)
     - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

   - **Item 6**: 
     - Highest value for remaining agents: Agent 0 (value 76), already has items.
     - Next highest: Agent 1 (value 34)
     - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1.

After these allocations, each agent has at least one item, and all 7 items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect the preferences of the agents while ensuring that all items are distributed among them.
