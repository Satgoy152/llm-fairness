Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  38  18  52  50  42  61  56
1   2  91  21  15   1  59  73
2  66  60  34  66   0  84  84
3   3  50   1  89  59  77   6
4  92  26  22  71  53  71  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [92 26 22 71 53 71 64]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as much as possible, relative to others. A commonly used method to achieve this is the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item.

Given the valuations, I'll perform a manual allocation:

1. **Agent 0's most valued item:** Item 5 (value 61)
2. **Agent 1's most valued item:** Item 1 (value 91)
3. **Agent 2's most valued item:** Item 5, but it's already taken, so next is Item 6 (value 84)
4. **Agent 3's most valued item:** Item 3 (value 89)
5. **Agent 4's most valued item:** Item 0 (value 92)

Now items 5, 1, 6, 3, and 0 are taken, leaving items 2 and 4:

6. **Agent 0's next preferred (available) item:** Item 2 (value 52)
7. **Agent 4's next preferred (available) item:** Item 4 (value 53)

Now all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives a bundle that, as much as possible, reflects their preferences given the constraints.
