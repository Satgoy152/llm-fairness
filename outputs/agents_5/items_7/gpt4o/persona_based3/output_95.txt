Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 7 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6
0  61  53  94   9  19  40  92
1  16  67  73  36  68  87  49
2  43  87  95  23  46   1  76
3  56  29  15  21  90  16  88
4  43  50  39  22  93  84  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 7 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the envy-freeness criterion, which ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the matrix of valuations, we will attempt to allocate items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [61, 53, 94, 9, 19, 40, 92]
Agent 1: [16, 67, 73, 36, 68, 87, 49]
Agent 2: [43, 87, 95, 23, 46, 1, 76]
Agent 3: [56, 29, 15, 21, 90, 16, 88]
Agent 4: [43, 50, 39, 22, 93, 84, 76]
```

A possible way to allocate the items is as follows:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (value 94) and item 6 (value 92), so let's allocate item 2 to them.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (value 87), so they will get item 5.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 1 (value 87), so they will get item 1.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (value 90), so they will get item 4.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 0 (value 43) and item 3 (value 22), but the highest valuation available is item 3, so they will get item 3.

Now we have the allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 3

We have used 5 items so far (items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). We need to allocate the remaining items 0 and 6.

- Agent 0 can take item 6 (value 92).
- Agent 4 can take item 0 (value 43).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 2, 6
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Items 0, 3

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets items based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```
