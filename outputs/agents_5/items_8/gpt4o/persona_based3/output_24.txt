Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22   2  32  59  11  31  71  83
1   7  40  38  22  43  92  28  53
2  15  36  99  34  35  67  27  58
3  95  95  45  12   5   3  78   1
4  45  23  98  28  65   9  88  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their valuations given the constraints. Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Highest Valuation Method**: Start by allocating items based on the highest valuation each agent places on the available items. This approach helps in minimizing envy.

2. **Iterative Selection**: Iteratively allocate items in rounds, considering the remaining items and the highest remaining valuations by each agent until all items are allocated.

3. **Balance and Fairness**: Ensure each agent receives at least some value and try to balance the total values as much as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 7 and 6.
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 5.
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2.
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 0 and 1.
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 4.

Now, let's allocate the items accordingly:

- **Agent 0**: Items 7, 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 5
- **Agent 2**: Item 2
- **Agent 3**: Items 0, 1
- **Agent 4**: Items 3, 4

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives some of their highest-valued items, minimizing envy and making the allocation as fair as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share based on their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
