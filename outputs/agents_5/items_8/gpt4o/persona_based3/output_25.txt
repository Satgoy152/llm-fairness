Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  59  49  91  35  55  96  43
1  55  58   9   5  99   0  47  61
2  58  37  85  26  26  75   0  60
3  16  28  43  86  27  52  48  78
4  60  51   2  20  75  89  45  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for envy-freeness where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own, given their valuations. The problem is an example of fair division in computational economics, and while it's challenging to guarantee envy-freeness in all cases with discrete items, we can attempt to balance the allocation as equitably as possible.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 0 and 6. Allocating these items to agent 0 maximizes their utility.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent places the highest value on item 4. They should receive item 4 to maximize their satisfaction.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 the most. Assigning this item to agent 2 is optimal for them.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 3, so it should be allocated to them.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent places high value on item 5 and also has a relatively high value for item 1. These items can be given to agent 4.

Now, let's check if every item has been allocated and ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with an item or set of items that they value highly, which should lead to a relatively fair outcome. Each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8, as required.
