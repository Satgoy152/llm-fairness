Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  37  39  62  24  30  60  15
1  37  73   7  73  50  75  96  58
2  77  15  53  24   9  35  50  26
3  10  98  53  35  78  92  67  62
4  99  47  56   6  28  11  43  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, given their individual valuations.

Given the valuations, one approach is to start by allocating the items that have the most disparate valuations among agents, ensuring that high-valued items for a particular agent are allocated to that agent. This method aims to minimize potential envy by assigning items to those who value them most, while balancing the overall distribution of value.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 2 highly (39).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 highly (75).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 highly (77).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 highly (98).
   - Agent 4 values item 0 highly (99).

2. **Assign unique high-value items first:** Assign items to agents where they have the highest valuation compared to others, ensuring no direct envy for those items.

3. **Allocate remaining items:** Distribute the remaining items considering the next highest preferences, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible.

Considering these steps, here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** [2]
- **Agent 1:** [5]
- **Agent 2:** [0]
- **Agent 3:** [1, 3]
- **Agent 4:** [4, 6, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, reducing potential envy, and all 8 items are distributed.

Final allocation in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [4, 6, 7]
}
```
