Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  90  92  95  32  33   4   7
1  25  12  32  13  29  26  62  45
2   7  66  43  50  87  75  40  32
3  46  58  21   7  75  75  52  75
4  48  82  92  16  66   6  77  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to minimize the envy by distributing items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Let's consider the following approach: 

1. **Assign the highest valued items first:** Start by assigning items to the agents who value them the most to minimize initial envy. 

2. **Check for balance:** After the initial assignment, verify if any agent has significantly fewer items or lower total valuation compared to others. Adjust by redistributing items if necessary.

3. **Final adjustments:** Ensure all items are distributed and each agent has an integer number of items.

Following these steps, here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Item 3 (highest value for agent 0)
- **Agent 1:** Items 6 and 7 (relatively higher values for agent 1)
- **Agent 2:** Items 4 and 5 (relatively higher values for agent 2)
- **Agent 3:** Items 0 and 1 (higher values for agent 3)
- **Agent 4:** Item 2 (highest value for agent 4)

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, which should help minimize potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
