Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  78  66  44  41  28  12  59
1  61  62  70  66   1  81  26  64
2  37  96  49  19  12   2  95  73
3  15  78  49  84  36  42  71  88
4  88  76  34  32  20  32  99  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own. Given the matrix of valuations, we can approach the problem using the Envy-Free (EF) concept, or any other fair division method that approximates envy-freeness.

### Strategy for Fair Allocation

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We have 5 agents and 8 items.
   - Each agent can be allocated at least one item since there are more items than agents.

2. **Greedy Allocation based on Maximum Valuation:**
   - Allocate items in a way that each agent gets the item they value highly, while ensuring overall fairness.

3. **Iterative Process:**
   - Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that no agent gets too many more items than others.

4. **Adjustments for Fairness:**
   - After initial allocation, check for any significant imbalances and adjust by swapping items among agents to reduce envy.

### Allocation:

Following these guidelines, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 1 highly (78), and item 2 (66).
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 5 highly (81), and item 3 (66).
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 1 highly (96), and item 6 (95).
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 7 highly (88), and item 3 (84).
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 0 highly (88), and item 6 (99).

Given these observations, we attempt to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, with adjustments to ensure all items are allocated:

- **Item 0:** Assign to Agent 4
- **Item 1:** Assign to Agent 2
- **Item 2:** Assign to Agent 0
- **Item 3:** Assign to Agent 3
- **Item 4:** Assign to Agent 0 (as a balancing measure)
- **Item 5:** Assign to Agent 1
- **Item 6:** Assign to Agent 4 (as they value it the most)
- **Item 7:** Assign to Agent 3

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, while the allocations aim to minimize envy by considering each agent's preferences. This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed.
