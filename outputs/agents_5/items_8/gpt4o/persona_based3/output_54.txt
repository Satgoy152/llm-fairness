Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  95  41  28  74  14   9  93
1   1  72  93  61  19  71  75  70
2  77  90  26  37  83  55  43  88
3  54  80  27  49  63  31  66  13
4  87  66   9  88  65   8  80  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we are looking for a fair division of items among agents, ideally aiming for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation means that each agent prefers their own allocation over any other agent's allocation, or at least doesn't prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations and the need to allocate all 8 items, let's analyze the matrix and find an allocation that minimizes envy.

We have the following valuations:

```
Agent 0: [80, 95, 41, 28, 74, 14, 9, 93]
Agent 1: [1, 72, 93, 61, 19, 71, 75, 70]
Agent 2: [77, 90, 26, 37, 83, 55, 43, 88]
Agent 3: [54, 80, 27, 49, 63, 31, 66, 13]
Agent 4: [87, 66, 9, 88, 65, 8, 80, 41]
```

Let's try to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 4 (87)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (95)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 1 (93)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 4 (88)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 2 (83)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 1 (71)

7. **Item 6**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 4 (80)

8. **Item 7**:
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0 (93)

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0: Initially gets items [1, 7]
- Agent 1: Initially gets items [2, 5]
- Agent 2: Initially gets item [4]
- Agent 3: No items yet
- Agent 4: Initially gets items [0, 3, 6]

To ensure fairness, we must allocate at least one item to Agent 3. Let's adjust:

- Move item 3 from Agent 4 to Agent 3.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 7]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [0, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and it attempts to maximize satisfaction based on valuations while ensuring at least some level of fairness.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```
