Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  43  94  22  57  40   1  51
1  73  67  76  84  88   1  17  21
2   9  54  65   5  31  21   8  70
3  17  73  69   7  72  99  65  53
4  86  16  54  27  45  93  36  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [73 67 76 84 88  1 17 21]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own. Given the preferences provided in the table, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their utility without causing envy.

After analyzing the valuations, I'll create allocations that attempt to minimize envy. However, due to the discrete nature of items and the specific preferences, complete envy-freeness may not be achievable, but we will aim to minimize it as much as possible.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most. 
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations while trying to balance total value among agents:

- Agent 0 (92, 43, 94) gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 (84, 88) gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 2 (70) gets item 7.
- Agent 3 (99, 73) gets items 5 and 1.
- Agent 4 (54, 27) gets item 6.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [6]
}
```
