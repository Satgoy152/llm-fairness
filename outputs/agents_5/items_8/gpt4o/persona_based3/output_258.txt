Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  21  60  90  37  50  35  91
1  27  33  59  48  24  86  58  94
2  41   1  40  20  81  31  31  67
3  59  24  73  52  13  48  19  49
4  23  85  54  57  15  71  60  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents based on the given valuations, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

To facilitate this, we can use a simple approach that considers the agents' preferences and attempts to balance their total valuation. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - There are 5 agents and 8 items.
   - Each agent should receive at least 1 item, as we have more items than agents.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - First, assign the highest valued item for each agent to ensure each agent gets at least one item they highly value.
   - Then, distribute the remaining items by trying to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

3. **Implementation of Allocation**:

   - Assign the most valuable item for each agent:
     - Agent 0's highest value is for item 7 (value 91).
     - Agent 1's highest value is for item 7 (value 94).
     - Agent 2's highest value is for item 4 (value 81).
     - Agent 3's highest value is for item 2 (value 73).
     - Agent 4's highest value is for item 1 (value 85).

   - Allocate these items first:
     - Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (94 > 91 for Agent 0).
     - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
     - Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
     - Assign item 1 to Agent 4.

   - Now, allocate the remaining items:
     - Items left: 0, 3, 5, 6
     - Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it is their second-highest value.
     - Assign item 3 to Agent 0, also highly valued by them.
     - Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is their second-highest value.
     - Assign item 6 to Agent 4, as it balances the allocation.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
   - Agent 1: Items [5, 7]
   - Agent 2: Item [4]
   - Agent 3: Item [2]
   - Agent 4: Items [1, 6]

5. **Result**:
   - This allocation attempts to be fair by balancing the highest valued items and ensuring each agent receives a share of their most valued items.

}
