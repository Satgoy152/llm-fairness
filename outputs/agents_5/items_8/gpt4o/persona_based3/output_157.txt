Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  48  77   0   4  22  81  82
1  13  14  45  57  41  22   7  11
2  25  67  54  91  26  86  19  40
3  34  74  41  93  47  60  46  62
4  78  70  35  37  43  27  42  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents fairly while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible given the constraints, we need to consider the agents' valuations for each item. Our goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are significantly high for items 0, 2, 6, and 7. The highest valuation is for item 7 at 82.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 at 57.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 3 at 91, but the next highest is item 5 at 86.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 3 at 93.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 0 at 78.

To allocate fairly, we should consider giving each agent their highest-valued available item first, then proceed to allocate the remaining items.

Based on this assessment, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 7 (highest valuations are for these items).
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (highest valuation).
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (next highest valuation after item 3).
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (next highest valuation after item 3).
- **Agent 4**: Items 1, 2, and 4 (next highest remaining valuations).

Now, let's make sure each agent has at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here's the allocation represented in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives consideration to each agent's preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.
