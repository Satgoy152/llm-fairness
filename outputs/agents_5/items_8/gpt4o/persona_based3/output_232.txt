Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  45  79  52  98  67  30  10
1  15  41  19  13  69  26   7  82
2  56  76  74  63  39  93  92  43
3  57  14  53  20  78  34  50  69
4   8  66  98  33  39  63  19  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we'll aim for an allocation where each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while maintaining a sense of fairness across the board. One approach to achieve this is using an envy-free method, if possible, or a strategy that minimizes envy.

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Agent**: Sum the agent's valuations for all items.
   - Agent 0: 475
   - Agent 1: 272
   - Agent 2: 536
   - Agent 3: 375
   - Agent 4: 343

2. **Allocate Items**:
   - Assign one or more high-value items for each agent based on their preferences to ensure they receive items they highly value.
   - Attempt to balance the allocation so that no agent feels envious of another (as much as possible), given the constraints.

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to minimize envy based on the given valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Prefers item 4 (value 98), item 0 (value 94), and item 2 (value 79). Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Prefers item 7 (value 82) and item 4 (value 69). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Prefers item 5 (value 93), item 6 (value 92), and item 1 (value 76). Assign items 5 and 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Prefers item 4 (value 78), item 7 (value 69), and item 0 (value 57). Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (since higher values are already allocated to others).
- **Agent 4**: Prefers item 2 (value 98), item 1 (value 66), and item 5 (value 63). Assign item 2 and item 1 to Agent 4.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring all items are allocated and attempting to minimize envy.
