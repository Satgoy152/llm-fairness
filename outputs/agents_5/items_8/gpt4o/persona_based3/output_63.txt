Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  15  76  25  30  24  39  57
1  41  93  86  89  73  79  79   2
2  47  85  36  67  26  52  83  76
3  24  39  39  55  33  74  44  13
4  35  45  88  20  54  72  30  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, a suitable approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns selecting their most-preferred available item. This method helps ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, reducing the chances of envy.

Let's apply this approach step-by-step:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 2 (value 76).
   - Agent 1 selects item 1 (value 93).
   - Agent 2 selects item 6 (value 83).
   - Agent 3 selects item 5 (value 74).
   - Agent 4 selects item 2 (value 88), but it's already taken, so selects item 5 (value 72).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 7 (value 57).
   - Agent 1 selects item 3 (value 89).
   - Agent 2 selects item 7 (value 76).
   - Agent 3 selects item 3 (value 55), but it's already taken, so selects item 0 (value 24).
   - Agent 4 selects item 4 (value 54).

3. **Round 3:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 0 (value 24), but it's already taken, so selects item 4 (value 30), but it's already taken, so selects item 3 (value 25).
   - All items are now allocated.

The allocation after these rounds is:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 6
- Agent 3: Items 5, 0
- Agent 4: Item 4

This allocation balances maximizing each agent's utility from their assigned items while ensuring no item is allocated more than once. 

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
