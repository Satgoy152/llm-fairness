Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  98  44  68  64  37  62  75
1  50  52  89  70  18  16  24  53
2  65  77  92  67  81  91  60   0
3  68  24  13  56  23  56  59  38
4  74  72  33  18  49  59  29  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a distribution where each agent receives a share of the items that is as fair as possible, potentially minimizing envy among agents. This means that ideally, each agent should value their allocation at least as much as any other agent values their own allocation.

Given the valuations matrix, we can attempt to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is balanced. Here's a possible allocation that achieves a fair distribution:

1. Analyze the total value each agent places on all items to understand the relative utility each agent derives.
2. Allocate items to agents while trying to equalize the total value for each agent as much as possible.
3. Ensure each agent gets between one and three items, given the constraints of 5 agents and 8 items.

Let's proceed with a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly and has some preference for items 3, 4, and 7.
- Agent 1 has a strong preference for item 2.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 2, 5, and 4.
- Agent 3 values item 0 and 3 relatively more.
- Agent 4 has a higher valuation for item 6.

An allocation that attempts to balance these preferences might look like this:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [4, 5]
- Agent 3: [0, 3]
- Agent 4: [6, 7]

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all 8 items are allocated and considers each agent's preferences to the best extent possible within the constraints.
