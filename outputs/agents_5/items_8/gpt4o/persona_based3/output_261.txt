Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  63  29  40  43  23  36  99
1  60  72  56  28  62  67  75  79
2  73  99  57   0   8  70  19  46
3  97  44  79  69  62  33  91  75
4  21   5  79   6   6  51  96  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction, which can be interpreted as giving each agent items they value highly while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Preferences:** Begin by identifying which items each agent values the most. This will help in ensuring that each agent gets at least some items they highly value.

2. **Initial Allocation:** Attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one of their most valued items, if possible. This helps in reducing potential envy among the agents.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness:** Adjust allocations if necessary to minimize envy. Envy-freeness in the strictest sense can be difficult to achieve with discrete items, but the goal is to make the allocation as fair as possible.

4. **Final Allocation:** Ensure that all 8 items are allocated, and no agent is given more than their fair share unless necessary to achieve a better overall fairness.

Using this approach, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 7 the most, followed by item 0.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 6 the most, followed by item 1.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 1 the most, followed by item 5.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 0 the most, followed by item 2.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 6 the most, followed by item 2.

Considering these preferences, let's make the allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Gets item 7 (high value for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1:** Gets items 6 and 4 (high value for Agent 1, fair allocation).
- **Agent 2:** Gets items 1 and 5 (high value for Agent 2).
- **Agent 3:** Gets items 0 and 3 (high value for Agent 3).
- **Agent 4:** Gets items 2 (ensures each agent gets an item).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some of the items they value while making sure all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
