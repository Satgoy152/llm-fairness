Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  24  60  65  79  19  67  65
1  17  35  63  49  64  60  99  44
2  36  78  55  64  68  93  68  93
3  42  72  87  45  11  58  97  42
4  89  37  54  40  67  16  13  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that they value highly, while also striving to maintain envy-freeness. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent would prefer the allocation of items that another agent received.

Given the valuations in the table, let's go through the process to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: We sum up the valuations each agent has for all items to understand their overall preference.

2. **Greedy Allocation Based on Highest Value**: We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the highest. This helps in maximizing individual satisfaction and potentially reduces envy.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Ensure that each agent receives at least one item since we have 8 items and 5 agents, and adjust allocations to avoid significant envy if possible.

Following this approach, hereâ€™s an allocation that aims to be fair based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the most (79).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the most (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 7 the most (93).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 the most (87).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 the most (89).

Continue with remaining allocations while considering fairness:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation for it (65).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as they have the highest remaining value (78).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, as they have a high valuation for it (60).

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This distribution tries to balance the high-value items among the agents while maintaining a fair allocation according to their preferences.
