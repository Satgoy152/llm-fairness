Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  34  55  45  90  60  33  25
1  64  58  54   9  23  98  15  97
2  10  47  16  71  19  38  60  53
3  99  12  90  46  11  86  22  72
4  92  83  30  48  81  12  66   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a way that aims to achieve envy-freeness, we can use a heuristic approach. One common method is to use the "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item. However, since we want to achieve a fair distribution among all agents, we will consider the valuations carefully to minimize envy.

Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest (90), so allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the highest (98), so allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the highest (71), so allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the highest (99), so allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 the highest (83), so allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, we have 3 items left (2, 6, 7) to allocate. We will give each agent an opportunity to pick again based on their next highest value for remaining items:

6. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 at 55, which is the highest among remaining options for Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1**: Values item 7 at 97, which is the highest among remaining options for Agent 1.
8. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 at 60, which is the highest among remaining options for Agent 2.

Thus, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```

These allocations ensure that each agent receives one or more items and make use of all 8 items.
