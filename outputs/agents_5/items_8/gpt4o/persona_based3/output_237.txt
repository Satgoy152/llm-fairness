Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80   5  40  66  34  28  67  26
1  25  55   5  84  84  33  26  13
2  55  11  92  92  76   1  89  45
3  57  21  80  39  59  32  72  15
4  89  29   4  68  48  75  86  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we can use a heuristic approach that distributes goods based on maximizing individual satisfaction while keeping allocations as balanced as possible. One common approach to achieve this is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most. However, since we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share, we will also consider the total value each agent receives.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify High Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Look at each item and find out which agent values it the most.
   - Assign the item to that agent if it doesn't significantly unbalance the overall allocation.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets a Fair Share:**
   - Verify that each agent receives a roughly equal total value based on their valuations.
   - Adjust allocations as necessary to balance the perceived value among agents.

### Allocation Plan:

1. **Item 0:** Highest value by Agent 4 (89). Assign to Agent 4.
2. **Item 1:** Highest value by Agent 1 (55). Assign to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** Highest value by Agent 2 (92). Assign to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3:** Highest value by Agent 1 and Agent 2 (84, 92). Assign to Agent 2 as Item 2 is already high.
5. **Item 4:** Highest value by Agent 1 (84). Assign to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5:** Highest value by Agent 4 (75). Assign to Agent 4.
7. **Item 6:** Highest value by Agent 4 (86). Assign to Agent 4.
8. **Item 7:** Highest value by Agent 0 (26). Assign to Agent 0.

### Ensure Fairness:
- Agents 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 should all have a fair total value.
- Doing a quick check of total values, ensure items are allocated to balance the total value as closely as possible.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while ensuring the overall distribution of values is as balanced as possible among all agents.
