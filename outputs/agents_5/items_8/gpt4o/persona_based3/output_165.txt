Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  87   2  57  81  75  98  98
1  42  43  32  82  31  74  62  40
2  38  58  21  25  66  52  56  31
3  97  51   4  75  73  42  18  40
4  69  83  88   5  96  68  61  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free division, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to ensure that no agent feels another agent has received a better share. Given the table, we can employ a procedure similar to the adjusted winner or divide-and-choose methods, although exact envy-freeness is challenging with discrete items.

We'll start by examining the valuations and trying to allocate items such that each agent values their bundle of items as highly as possible, while also considering the others. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 1, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a moderate distribution of valuations, with a slight preference for item 4.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 highly.
5. **Agent 4**: Has high valuations for items 2 and 4.

A possible allocation that aims to maximize overall satisfaction might be:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 7] (high valuation for these items)
- **Agent 1**: [3] (strong preference for this item)
- **Agent 2**: [4, 5] (moderate preference, but item 4 is relatively valued)
- **Agent 3**: [0] (high valuation for this item)
- **Agent 4**: [2, 6] (strong preference for item 2 and decent for item 6)

These allocations attempt to give each agent at least one item they value highly, minimizing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation uses all 8 items and respects each agent's preferences as much as possible within these constraints.
