Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  95  94  63  96  69  21  69
1  42   8   1  91  58  36  32  68
2  22  57  86  65  57  41  85  31
3  36  63  80  37  38  13  19  94
4  45  63  70  90  42  93  86  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they have received at least as much value as any other agent, given their own preferences.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we might approach this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: We'll start by calculating the total value that each agent assigns to all items.

   - Agent 0: 84 + 95 + 94 + 63 + 96 + 69 + 21 + 69 = 591
   - Agent 1: 42 + 8 + 1 + 91 + 58 + 36 + 32 + 68 = 336
   - Agent 2: 22 + 57 + 86 + 65 + 57 + 41 + 85 + 31 = 444
   - Agent 3: 36 + 63 + 80 + 37 + 38 + 13 + 19 + 94 = 380
   - Agent 4: 45 + 63 + 70 + 90 + 42 + 93 + 86 + 11 = 500

2. **Identify High Valuation Items for Each Agent**: We can consider allocating items to agents based on high individual valuations.

3. **Fair Allocation Strategy**: We want to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have a fair share compared to others. Given the constraint of allocating exactly 8 items, we can use a fairness criterion like maximizing the minimum envy.

4. **Iterative Allocation**: We will iteratively allocate items to the agents based on their highest preferences, ensuring no agent is significantly envious of another. We will adjust allocations to maintain balance.

5. **Check Envy-Freeness**: After each allocation, we will check if any agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Considering these steps, here's a feasible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (96), followed by item 1 (95), so we allocate these to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 (91) the highest, so we allocate this to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 (86) the highest, so we allocate this to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 7 (94) the highest, so we allocate this to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 (93) the highest, so we allocate this to Agent 4.
- We then consider remaining items and fill in the gaps to balance allocations.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [7, 0]
- Agent 4: [5, 6]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7, 0],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation balances the high-value items across agents and attempts to minimize envy based on the agents' valuations.
