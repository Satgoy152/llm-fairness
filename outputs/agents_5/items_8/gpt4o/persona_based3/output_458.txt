Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  25  93  18  98  94  45  64
1  22  47  72  40  82  32  49  40
2  33  56  85  94   7  42  96  59
3  98  16  42  68  69  38  72  55
4  68  18  85  37  22  99  91  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent, given their own valuation.

This is a challenging problem and might not always have a perfect solution, but we can try to make the allocations as fair as possible. One common approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where each agent takes turns selecting their most-preferred available item until all items are allocated. However, this method doesn't always guarantee envy-freeness, especially in cases with diverse valuations.

Let's attempt a manual allocation considering the goal of minimizing envy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 4 and 5.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 3 and 6.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 0.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 5, but it's already taken by agent 0. Therefore, agent 4 could take item 7.

Given this setup, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items [4, 5] (total value = 98 + 94 = 192)
- **Agent 1**: Item [2] (total value = 72)
- **Agent 2**: Items [3, 6] (total value = 94 + 96 = 190)
- **Agent 3**: Item [0] (total value = 98)
- **Agent 4**: Item [7] (total value = 76)

This allocation is based on the highest valuations for some items and attempts to reduce potential envy by giving high-value items to agents who value them most. However, achieving complete envy-freeness is complex and might not be fully possible with the given valuations. The goal is to minimize potential envy as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7]
}
```
