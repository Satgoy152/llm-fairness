Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  80  12   2  26  70  93  17
1  61  78  74   9  27  24  82  36
2  10  47  46  19  65  29   6  92
3  63  20  31  72  40   1  81   9
4  79  14  22  60   7  78  99  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 80 12  2 26 70 93 17]
 [61 78 74  9 27 24 82 36]
 [10 47 46 19 65 29  6 92]
 [63 20 31 72 40  1 81  9]
 [79 14 22 60  7 78 99 57]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free, if possible, or at least equitable in terms of perceived value to each agent. Given the valuations from the table, we'll attempt an allocation that tries to optimize fairness.

Let's analyze the situation:

### Step 1: Identify the total value each agent places on all the items.
- Agent 0: 81 + 80 + 12 + 2 + 26 + 70 + 93 + 17 = 381
- Agent 1: 61 + 78 + 74 + 9 + 27 + 24 + 82 + 36 = 391
- Agent 2: 10 + 47 + 46 + 19 + 65 + 29 + 6 + 92 = 314
- Agent 3: 63 + 20 + 31 + 72 + 40 + 1 + 81 + 9 = 317
- Agent 4: 79 + 14 + 22 + 60 + 7 + 78 + 99 + 57 = 416

### Step 2: Allocate items based on preferences while aiming for a balanced total value for each agent.

Let's try to allocate items to balance the total value perceived by each agent:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 6 the most (93), followed by item 0 (81). Choose item 6 and 0.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 2 the most (74), followed by item 6, which is already taken. Choose item 2 and item 1 (78).
- **Agent 2:** Values item 7 the most (92), item 4 (65) is the second highest. Choose item 7 and 4.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 3 the most (72). Choose item 3.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 6 the most (99), but itâ€™s already taken. Next is item 5 (78). Choose item 5.

### Step 3: Check for remaining items and allocate them.
The remaining items are: 1 and 2.

Now, let's check our initial allocations and adjust:

- **Agent 0:** Items 6, 0 (Total value: 174)
- **Agent 1:** Items 2, 1 (Total value: 152)
- **Agent 2:** Items 7, 4 (Total value: 157)
- **Agent 3:** Item 3 (Total value: 72)
- **Agent 4:** Item 5 (Total value: 78)

Adjust to ensure all items are allocated:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 3
- Assign the remaining item 1 to Agent 4, who values it least but still needs an additional item.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 1]
}
```
This allocation ensures all items are distributed while balancing the total perceived value among the agents as much as possible, given the constraints.
