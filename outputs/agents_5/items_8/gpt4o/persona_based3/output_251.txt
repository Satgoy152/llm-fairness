Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  66  78  62  63  44  56  52
1  25  10   2  12   7  83  96  10
2  36  18  97  10  22  33  11   7
3  80  32  74  14  63  80  26  52
4  86  88  39  60  80  21  23  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences. Since envy-freeness is a strong criterion, achieving exact envy-freeness can be challenging, but we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation.

First, let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 seems to value item 0 the highest (91), followed by item 2 (78).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 6 (96), followed by item 5 (83).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (97), significantly more than any other item.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0 (80) and 5 (80).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (88), followed by item 0 (86).

Given these preferences, let's attempt to allocate the items while considering both high valuations and distributing the items evenly:

1. **Allocate item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most, but Agent 3 also values it highly. To avoid envy, we'll give it to Agent 0, who has the highest valuation.

2. **Allocate item 1**: Agent 4 values it the highest, so we allocate it to Agent 4.

3. **Allocate item 2**: Agent 2 values it significantly higher than anyone else, so it goes to Agent 2.

4. **Allocate item 3**: It's not particularly highly valued by anyone, but Agent 3 could use more items to balance allocations, so it goes to Agent 3.

5. **Allocate item 4**: Similar to item 3, Agent 4 values it decently, so we allocate it to Agent 4.

6. **Allocate item 5**: Agent 1 values it the second highest after item 6, so it goes to Agent 1.

7. **Allocate item 6**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for this item, so it goes to Agent 1.

8. **Allocate item 7**: This item can help balance the allocations further. Given the leftover, we'll assign it to Agent 3, who has fewer items.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This distribution aims to satisfy the agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
