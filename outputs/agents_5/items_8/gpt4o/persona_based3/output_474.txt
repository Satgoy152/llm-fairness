Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  36   3  61  71  58  78  20
1  37  72  36   7  87  38  13  22
2  13   1  32  89  25  49  32  39
3  68  22  43  61  10  76  39  76
4  68  85  38   4   4  30  71  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. However, with discrete items and specific valuations, perfect envy-freeness might not always be achievable, but we can strive for a fair distribution.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: 91 + 36 + 3 + 61 + 71 + 58 + 78 + 20 = 418
   - Agent 1: 37 + 72 + 36 + 7 + 87 + 38 + 13 + 22 = 312
   - Agent 2: 13 + 1 + 32 + 89 + 25 + 49 + 32 + 39 = 280
   - Agent 3: 68 + 22 + 43 + 61 + 10 + 76 + 39 + 76 = 395
   - Agent 4: 68 + 85 + 38 + 4 + 4 + 30 + 71 + 27 = 327

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**:
   - Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**:
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item, and try to balance the total value received by each agent.

**Allocation Plan**:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value in items 0 (91), 3 (61), 5 (58)
- **Agent 1**: Highest value in items 1 (72), 4 (87)
- **Agent 2**: Highest value in item 2 (32)
- **Agent 3**: High values in items 6 (39), 7 (76)
- **Agent 4**: High value in item 7 (27), but already allocated to Agent 3, so no high-value unique items left.

Due to constraints, adjustments are necessary. After considering the above and ensuring all items are allocated, a balanced approach is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 6, 7],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 3, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 4, which they value highly.
- Agent 2 receives item 2, which is their highest valuation item.
- Agent 3 receives items 5, 6, and 7, which they have relatively high valuations for.
- Agent 4 receives no items, which highlights the difficulty in achieving perfect fairness with limited items and specific valuations. Adjustments can be made based on further negotiation or additional items. 

This allocation is an attempt to balance the value received while ensuring all items are allocated.
