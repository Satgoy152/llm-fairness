Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  98  73  14  87  54  15  79
1  65  66  22   0  18  30  84  91
2  50  26  28   8  63  10  53  25
3  53  76   5  23   4   5  80  55
4  40  19  97   9  81  32  66  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we seek an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others.

A commonly used approach is to allocate items based on maximizing individual valuations while attempting to achieve a balanced distribution. Below is one way to allocate the items.

### Allocation Approach:
1. Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, respecting the constraint that each agent receives at least one item.
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated equals 8.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Receives items with highest valuations from their perspective.
- **Agent 1**: Receives items with highest valuations from their perspective.
- **Agent 2**: Receives items with highest valuations from their perspective.
- **Agent 3**: Receives items with highest valuations from their perspective.
- **Agent 4**: Receives items with highest valuations from their perspective.

### Detailed Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (value 98)
- **Agent 1**: Item 7 (value 91)
- **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value 63)
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (value 80)
- **Agent 4**: Items 2 (value 97), 5 (value 32), 0 (value 40), 3 (value 9)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy while distributing all 8 items. Each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is balanced with respect to individual valuations.

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 5, 0, 3]
}
```
