Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  70  35  98  48  93  56  84
1  73  54  37  35  68  53   5  83
2  41   3  31  41   5  75  32   1
3  15  76  30  94  78  94  66  80
4  44  40  12  56  66  72  43  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 8 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  70  35  98  48  93  56  84
1  73  54  37  35  68  53   5  83
2  41   3  31  41   5  75  32   1
3  15  76  30  94  78  94  66  80
4  44  40  12  56  66  72  43  82
```

To allocate items fairly, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring no agent envies another. A common approach is to assign items based on the highest relative valuation first.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3 (98).
2. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5 (94).
3. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (92).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 (76).
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 7 (82).
6. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 4 (66).
7. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (35).
8. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6 (32).

The allocation of items based on the above assignments is:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 0, 2
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Items 5, 1
- Agent 4: Items 7, 4

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest relative valuations, striving for an envy-free and fair division of resources given the constraints.
