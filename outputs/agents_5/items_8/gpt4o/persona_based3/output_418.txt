Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  39  33  97  58  11  19  66
1  30  56  60  95   6   6  21  40
2   0  23  87  96  12  67  70  78
3  75  63   2   2  31  18  48  22
4  78  60  29  32  91   5  92  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can employ a round-robin approach. We will assign items to agents in a way that attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Start by selecting the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation.
3. Repeat the process for the remaining items until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the steps:

- Item 3 is most valued by Agent 0 and Agent 1, both with a valuation of 97 and 95 respectively, so we allocate it to Agent 0.
- Item 2 is most valued by Agent 2 with a valuation of 87, so it is allocated to Agent 2.
- Item 4 is most valued by Agent 4 with a valuation of 91, so it is allocated to Agent 4.
- Item 7 is most valued by Agent 2 with a valuation of 78, so it is allocated to Agent 2.
- Item 6 is most valued by Agent 4 with a valuation of 92, so it is allocated to Agent 4.
- Item 0 is most valued by Agent 4 with a valuation of 78, so it is allocated to Agent 4.
- Item 1 is most valued by Agent 1 with a valuation of 56, so it is allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 5 is most valued by Agent 2 with a valuation of 67, so it is allocated to Agent 2.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that every item is allocated fairly.
