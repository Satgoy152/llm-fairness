Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  83  99  89  70  67  86  55
1  33  67  10  48   7  15  17  67
2   5  49  42  61  88   7   3  52
3  72  74  59  42  73  23  92  80
4  35  12  89  23  49  62  49   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring an envy-free distribution, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to minimize envy, which means each agent should feel that they have received a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  83  99  89  70  67  86  55
1  33  67  10  48   7  15  17  67
2   5  49  42  61  88   7   3  52
3  72  74  59  42  73  23  92  80
4  35  12  89  23  49  62  49   2
```

We'll use a method that roughly considers the highest value each agent places on items and tries to distribute them evenly.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Identify top preferences**: Each agent should receive at least one of their highly valued items.
2. **Rotate allocation**: Go through each agent and allocate one of their top preferences until all items are distributed.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Prefers items with values 99, 89, 86...
  - Allocate item 2 (value 99) to Agent 0.
  
- **Agent 1**: Prefers items with values 67, 67, 48...
  - Allocate item 1 (value 67) to Agent 1.
  
- **Agent 2**: Prefers items with values 88, 61, 52...
  - Allocate item 4 (value 88) to Agent 2.
  
- **Agent 3**: Prefers items with values 92, 80, 74...
  - Allocate item 6 (value 92) to Agent 3.
  
- **Agent 4**: Prefers items with values 89, 62, 49...
  - Allocate item 5 (value 62) to Agent 4.

Now, we continue to allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Next preference is item 3 (value 89).
  - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

- **Agent 1**: Next preference is item 7 (value 67).
  - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2**: Allocate one more item to Agent 2 to ensure all 8 items are allocated.
  - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the preferences, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations.
