Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  85  37  83  32  46  42  42
1  80  37  29  31  78  77  99  23
2  58   2  61  39  48  93  78  78
3  11  77  89  40   4  56  54  75
4   4  83  70  29  89  66  53  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we need to analyze the valuation matrix and distribute the goods in a way that minimizes potential envy.

One common approach is to use the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or a similar method such as the "Envy-Free Cake-Cutting" algorithm adapted for discrete items. However, given that these algorithms can be complex and computationally intensive, we will aim for a simpler allocation that reasonably reflects fair division principles.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0 and 1.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 6.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 5.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 4.

We'll start by assigning these high-value items to these agents.

**Allocation Plan:**

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (Value: 85).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (Value: 99).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (Value: 93).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (Value: 89).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (Value: 89).

Now, we have allocated 5 items and need to allocate 3 more. We can consider the next highest valuations and try to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 also values item 3 highly (Value: 83).
- Agent 1 also values item 4 (but it's already allocated), so consider item 1 (Value: 37).
- Agent 2 values item 3, but it's already allocated, so consider item 7 (Value: 78).
- Agent 3 values item 7 (Value: 75).
- Agent 4 values item 1 (Value: 83) but can settle for item 7.

**Final Allocation:**

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2.

This allocation gives each agent at least one high-value item and tries to balance the overall distribution.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and all items are distributed, aiming for an envy-free solution.
