Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  90  86   0   8  12  61  64
1  16   7  55   2  69  73  64  81
2  10  55  28  87  56  88  14  65
3  59  35  50  59  34  59  44  42
4  23  84  23  36  33  86   4  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own based on their valuations. Given the complexity of ensuring perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations, we'll aim for a fair distribution that minimizes envy.

To achieve this, we'll use an iterative approach to allocate items based on the highest marginal gain for each agent:

1. **Identify Initial Preferences:** Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their general preference intensity.

2. **Greedy Allocation Process:** Iteratively allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation for unallocated items until all items are allocated. This doesn't guarantee envy-freeness but helps in achieving a balanced distribution.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** After the initial allocation, re-evaluate the distribution to address any significant imbalance or obvious envy issues.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Initial Preferences by Total Value:**
   - Agent 0: Total Value = 370
   - Agent 1: Total Value = 367
   - Agent 2: Total Value = 403
   - Agent 3: Total Value = 382
   - Agent 4: Total Value = 347

2. **Greedy Allocation:**
   - Step 1: Allocate the highest valued item for each agent sequentially, considering available items.

Iterating through this process, we might find the following allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (90), item 6 (61), and item 7 (64) significantly.
- Agent 1 might prefer item 5 (73) and item 7 (81).
- Agent 2 values item 3 (87) and item 5 (88) highly.
- Agent 3 has a relatively balanced valuation across items.
- Agent 4 has a high value for item 1 (84) and item 5 (86).

3. **Final Allocation:**

After applying the greedy strategy and making some adjustments for fairness, here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives while considering their highest-value items. Note that some agents may receive fewer items but with higher total value according to their own valuation, aligning with the principles of fair division.
