Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  92  41  48  14  75  96  54
1   0  93  58  73  50  55  85  80
2   0   4  42  79  11  89   1  37
3  21  89   7  64  93  39  68  77
4  45  69  86  65  46  38   6  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 0 93 58 73 50 55 85 80]
 [ 0  4 42 79 11 89  1 37]
 [21 89  7 64 93 39 68 77]
 [45 69 86 65 46 38  6 59]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free if possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle, based on their valuations.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign the items to agents who value them the most, while balancing the number of items each agent receives. However, since envy-freeness is a complex criterion, we will aim for a solution that is as fair as possible under these constraints.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Assign to Agent 4 (Value: 45, highest valuation for item 0).
2. Item 1: Assign to Agent 1 (Value: 93, highest valuation for item 1).
3. Item 2: Assign to Agent 4 (Value: 86, highest valuation for item 2).
4. Item 3: Assign to Agent 2 (Value: 79, highest valuation for item 3).
5. Item 4: Assign to Agent 3 (Value: 93, highest valuation for item 4).
6. Item 5: Assign to Agent 2 (Value: 89, highest valuation for item 5).
7. Item 6: Assign to Agent 0 (Value: 96, highest valuation for item 6).
8. Item 7: Assign to Agent 3 (Value: 77, highest valuation for item 7).

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, the items are distributed such that each agent gets at least one item, and we try to maximize the total valuation of the items they receive. While this may not guarantee complete envy-freeness, it attempts to reach a fair distribution based on the available valuations.
