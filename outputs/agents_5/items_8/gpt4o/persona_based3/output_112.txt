Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  26  40  88  47  26  19  93
1  25   1  98  85  16  59  27  65
2  67  63  58  94  66  57  73  71
3  14  66   3  40  18  55  21  41
4  11  38  91  95  94  26  15  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent feels that their allocation is as good as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuation. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we can strive for an allocation that minimizes envy.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed fairly.

Let's examine the valuations and make allocations:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation for item 7 (93), then item 3 (88).
- Agent 1: Highest valuation for item 2 (98), then item 3 (85).
- Agent 2: Highest valuation for item 3 (94), then item 0 (67).
- Agent 3: Highest valuation for item 1 (66), then item 5 (55).
- Agent 4: Highest valuation for item 7 (99), then item 3 (95).

To minimize envy, a possible allocation is:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Items 3, 4, 1, 6

This allocation attempts to balance the valuation and ensures all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent their highest or next highest valued item, given the constraints, and ensures all items are distributed.
