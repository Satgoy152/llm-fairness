Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17   2  20  21  56  85  48  24
1   2  85  58  44  42  57  68  34
2  23  14  55  80   1  36  82  67
3  42  43  11  31  92  92  76  54
4  91   7  60  77  74  25  16  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total utility for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and aiming to minimize envy among agents. One of the methods to achieve this is the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most preferred available item according to their valuations.

Let's implement a fair allocation using a sequential allocation approach:

1. Determine the "turn" order of agents, which can be arbitrary. For simplicity, let's use a fixed order: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

2. In each round, allow each agent to choose one item that they value the most among the remaining items.

3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Here's how this would work for the given data:

- **Round 1:**
  - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 85)
  - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 85)
  - Agent 2 picks item 6 (value 82)
  - Agent 3 picks item 4 (value 92)
  - Agent 4 picks item 0 (value 91)

- **Round 2:**
  - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 24)
  - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 58)
  - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 80)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and aims to maximize their utility based on their preferences. The total number of items allocated is exactly 8, as required.
