Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  18  47  54  95  52  86  47
1   3  56  14  62  63  96  89  40
2  74  82  20  40  49  65  26  34
3  70   9  50  52  37  62  50  44
4  16  36  22  82  94  83  91  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. This approach ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's proceed with an allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences.
2. Use an iterative process to allocate items while keeping track of each agent's remaining fair share.
3. Adjust allocations to minimize envy by ensuring each agent gets items they value highly.

### Step-by-step Allocation

We will use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which maximizes the product of each agent's utility, as a proxy for fairness. We'll aim to give each agent at least one item and try to balance the allocation based on their preferences.

1. **Agent 0:** Highly values item 4 (95). We allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Highly values item 5 (96). We allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Highly values item 1 (82). We allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Highly values item 0 (70). We allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Highly values item 3 (82). We allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, allocate the remaining items to spread out the values:

6. **Remaining items:** 2, 6, 7

   - **Agent 2:** Next highest is item 7 (34). We allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
   - **Agent 3:** Next highest is item 6 (50). We allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
   - **Agent 4:** Next highest is item 2 (22). We allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the allocation is distributed to minimize envy as much as possible based on their highest valuations.
