Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  66  51  33  41  15  43  48
1  24   5   1  58   2  47  61  79
2  42  82  99  57  45  57  55  84
3  57  33  88  30  69  18  60  49
4  31  91  19  93  26  39  24  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free distribution. The envy-free criterion means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation of items over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's go through a process to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: We will look for the highest value each agent has for any item and try to allocate that item to them, if possible.

2. **Allocate items to agents**: We continue the process of allocation while ensuring that no items are unassigned and each agent gets a fair share as much as possible.

3. **Re-evaluate and adjust**: If an initial allocation leads to envy (where an agent would prefer another agent's allocation), adjustments may be needed.

From the given valuation table, we proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 1.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 7.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 2, but since it is assigned to Agent 2, the next highest is item 0.
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 3.

Let's allocate these items first, and then adjust:

1. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Item 1
   - Agent 1: Item 7
   - Agent 2: Item 2
   - Agent 3: Item 0
   - Agent 4: Item 3

2. **Remaining Items**: Items 4, 5, 6 remain unallocated.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 can take item 4 (highest remaining valuation among unallocated items).
   - Agent 1 can take item 6.
   - Agent 3 can take item 5.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 1, 4
   - Agent 1: Items 7, 6
   - Agent 2: Item 2
   - Agent 3: Items 0, 5
   - Agent 4: Item 3

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to align with the agents' highest preferences and ensures no item is left unallocated, while aiming for a fair distribution.
