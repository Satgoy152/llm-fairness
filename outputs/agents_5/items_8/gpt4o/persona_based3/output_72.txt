Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  17  60  26  13   8  34  96
1  49  43   5  72  44   8  48  33
2  62   4   1  28  55  39  18  32
3  51  77  67   8  61  22  90  79
4  78  72  77  86   5  29  90  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent perceives they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

One potential approach is to use the "maximum envy-free" method, where each agentâ€™s most valued items are allocated in a way that minimizes envy. However, given that we have exactly 8 items and 5 agents, not every agent can receive the same number of items. We'll attempt to ensure that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, if possible.

Here's one possible allocation using the provided valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (96). Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (72). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (62). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (90). Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest, but it's already taken by Agent 1. The next highest-valued item for Agent 4 is item 0, which is already taken by Agent 2. The next available highest is item 4 with a value of 5. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. The remaining items (1, 2, 5) need to be allocated to minimize envy.

6. Assign item 1 to Agent 3, as it has a high value for them (77), and they already have item 6.
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they have a moderate value for it (60), and they already have item 7.
8. Assign item 5 to Agent 2, as they have a moderate value for it (39), and they already have item 0.

This allocation attempts to balance the values each agent receives while ensuring that the total number of items is allocated.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [6, 1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and attempts to distribute the items fairly based on the highest possible value each agent can receive under the given constraints.
