Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  67   3  62  60  68  31  13
1  15  12  40  32  20  36   5  51
2  42  61  46  27  79  78  38  90
3  17  13  40  45  10  53  78  25
4  47  51  87  48  99  48  45  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the different valuations, we will attempt to allocate items so that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Let's summarize the process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Each agent has different valuations for items. We aim to allocate items such that no agent envies another's allocation based on their own valuation.

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: Allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for any item that has not yet been allocated.

3. **Adjustments for Fairness**: If an item is highly valued by multiple agents, we may need to adjust allocations to ensure fairness and minimize envy.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 5. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 7. Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 7, but it's already taken. Their next highest is item 4. Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 6. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4** highly values item 4, but it's already taken. Their next highest is item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 1, 3) to ensure each agent has at least one item and the allocation is envy-free as possible.

- **Agent 0** gets item 1 (next highest after 5).
- **Agent 1** gets item 3 (next highest after 7).
- **Agent 4** gets item 0 (next highest after 2).

Let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items such that each agent receives valued items according to their preferences, and the total number of allocated items is 8.
