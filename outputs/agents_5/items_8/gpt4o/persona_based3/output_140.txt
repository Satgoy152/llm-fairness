Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  17  30  19  57  43  32   5
1  99  76  66  69  57  40   7  39
2  62  52  36  27  11  36  29  53
3  47  78  96  72  85  30   5   5
4  62  67  57   6  64  60  99  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Our aim is to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, given their valuations.

One approach to achieve this is to use the adjusted winner procedure or a similar fair division method. However, given the integer constraints on the number of items each agent can receive and the total number of items, we will proceed with an intuitive allocation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Highest Valuation Assignment**: Start by assigning items based on highest valuations to ensure each agent receives at least one item they highly value.

2. **Balancing the Load**: Allocate the remaining items considering the next highest valuations, ensuring each agent feels they received a fair share relative to others.

Let's implement this:

- **Agent 0**: Valuations are relatively lower compared to others. We'll assign item 4 (value 57).
- **Agent 1**: Highly values item 0 (value 99). We'll assign this item.
- **Agent 2**: We'll assign item 7 (value 53) as it's the highest for this agent.
- **Agent 3**: Highly values item 2 (value 96). We'll assign this item.
- **Agent 4**: Highly values item 6 (value 99). We'll assign this item.

Now, we have 3 more items to allocate: items 1, 3, and 5.

- **Agent 1** has a high value for item 3 (value 69), we'll assign this item.
- **Agent 3** has a high value for item 1 (value 78), we'll assign this item.
- **Agent 4** has a relatively higher value for item 5 (value 60).

After this allocation, we have considered the highest valuations and distributed the items fairly.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 1],
    "4": [6, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items valued highly from their perspective, thereby attempting to maximize envy-freeness within the constraints.
