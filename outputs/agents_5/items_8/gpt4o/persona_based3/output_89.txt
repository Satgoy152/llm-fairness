Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  63  70  81  68  33  71  40
1  28  56   9  21  66  86  78  33
2   2  66  39  26  27  88  29  64
3  70  64  17  10  55  22  68  69
4  92  31  26  12   9  43   8  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's valuation of their own allocation relative to others. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, not every agent will receive the same number of items, so it's important to ensure that the allocations are as balanced as possible in terms of their perceived value.

Let's approach this by attempting to give each agent items that maximize their individual valuations while considering the overall distribution.

### Valuations Table
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  63  70  81  68  33  71  40
1  28  56   9  21  66  86  78  33
2   2  66  39  26  27  88  29  64
3  70  64  17  10  55  22  68  69
4  92  31  26  12   9  43   8  66
```

### Proposed Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: Items with highest valuations are 3 (81), 2 (70).
2. **Agent 1**: Item with highest valuation is 5 (86).
3. **Agent 2**: Item with highest valuation is 5 (88), but since it's already allocated, we can consider 7 (64).
4. **Agent 3**: Item with highest valuation is 0 (70).
5. **Agent 4**: Item with highest valuation is 0 (92), but since it's already allocated, consider 7 (66).

### Allocation Process
- Start by assigning the highest valued item to each agent considering existing assignments.
- Aim for each agent to get at least one highly valued item.
- Adjust allocations to ensure each item is assigned to one agent.

### Allocation
- **Agent 0**: [3, 6]
- **Agent 1**: [5]
- **Agent 2**: [7]
- **Agent 3**: [2, 0]
- **Agent 4**: [1, 4]

This distribution attempts to balance the high-value items among agents while ensuring each agent gets a significant portion of their highly valued items.

### JSON Output
```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 0],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
