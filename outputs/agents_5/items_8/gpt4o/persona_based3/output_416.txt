Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  21  48  98  73  56  36  65
1  60  96  19  29  85  90  12  31
2   0  77  32  34  30  72  68  59
3  97  26  21  70   3  33  87  73
4  47  25  70  15  92  53  99  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can apply the concept of maximizing the total value each agent can receive while ensuring that envy-freeness is maintained as much as possible. One approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum Nash welfare" which tries to balance the allocations by maximizing the product of each agent's total valuation of their assigned items.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** For each potential allocation, calculate the total valuation for each agent.

2. **Iterate to Find a Fair Allocation:** Start by assigning items that are most valued by a specific agent, then balance the rest by iteratively assigning the next highest valued item to an agent who has not yet received an item or has the least current total value.

3. **Ensure Complete Allocation:** Make sure that all items are assigned in such a way that as many agents as possible are satisfied, with consideration to maintaining fairness and envy-freeness.

Considering the given valuations, a potential fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 3.
- **Agent 1** prefers item 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 5.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 0.
- **Agent 4** highly values item 6.

After assigning the most valued items, distribute the remaining items to balance the allocations:

- Assign item 2 to **Agent 4** (next highest value after item 6).
- Assign item 4 to **Agent 1** (next highest value after item 1).
- Assign item 7 to **Agent 3** (next highest value after item 0).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation is done to balance the total value received by each agent while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their individual preferences for the items.
