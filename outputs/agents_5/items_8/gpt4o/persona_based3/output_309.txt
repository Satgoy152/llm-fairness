Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  83  50  57  60  73  72  89
1   5   6  15  66  96  85  11  72
2  66  69  57  36  20  50  11  22
3  13  89  38  54  39  58  87  60
4  67  40  14   7  22  74  57  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's valuation based on their preferences. Here, we'll aim for an allocation where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations, we can proceed by using a method similar to the adjusted winner procedure or envy-free division techniques. Letâ€™s try to allocate items to maximize the total satisfaction and minimize envy.

Here is a possible allocation that balances the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 7 and 1 the most, which are among the highest values that any agent gives to any item.
- Agent 1 highly values items 4 and 5.
- Agent 2 gives relatively high values to items 0 and 2.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 5, but since that is already assigned, we can assign other items by balancing remaining possible values.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 3: Item [6]
- Agent 4: Item [3]

This distribution aims to give each agent items they value highly, while also ensuring each agent gets at least one item. It is not perfectly envy-free, but it attempts to minimize dissatisfaction based on the given data.

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed, and each agent has an integer number of items.
