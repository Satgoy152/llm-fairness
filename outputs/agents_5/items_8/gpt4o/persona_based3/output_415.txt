Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  18  97  29  35  26  62  10
1   4  78  27  86  88  82  75  30
2  91  87  94  22  21  25  67  69
3  44  53  40  33  47   5  38  14
4  92  51  63  68  64  68  84  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we will use a method that attempts to ensure envy-freeness, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other's based on their own valuations. Given the valuations matrix, we try to assign items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while keeping the distribution fair.

Below is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (97) and item 6 (62). Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (88) and item 3 (86). Assign these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has high values across the board but can be given item 0 (91) for notable satisfaction.
4. **Agent 3** doesn't have very high values but can be given item 1 (53) to balance the distribution.
5. **Agent 4** values item 7 (34) the least among others but can be given item 5 (68) due to higher comparative value.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are among the highest in their valuation, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations while distributing all items fairly among the agents.
