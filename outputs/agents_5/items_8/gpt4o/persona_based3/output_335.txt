Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  38  66  62   2  88  33   9
1  88  76  62  11  23  54  83  53
2  62  36  99  88  24  60  67  31
3  50  15  93   2   1   0  88  27
4  81   6  59  74  15  31  53  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what they perceive they could get if they swapped with any other agent. Given the valuations, we'll aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, considering each agent's preferences.

Let's break down the allocations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 the most, but also has a high value for item 2.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most, which hasn't been highly valued by others yet.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most, but also has a high value for item 3.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the most.
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the most, but that's already assigned to Agent 1, so we consider other high-value items for Agent 4.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item based on their highest preferences, and balance out the allocations to make the distribution as fair as possible:

- **Agent 0**: We'll assign items [5, 1] since item 5 is highly valued by Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item [0] since Agent 1 values it the most.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item [2], as it is highly valued and not given to others yet.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item [6], which is highly valued by Agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Assign items [3, 4, 7], distributing remaining items based on remaining preferences.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 4, 7]
}
```
