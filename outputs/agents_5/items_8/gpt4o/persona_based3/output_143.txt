Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  70  87  74  61  95  76  39
1  72   3  26  99   6  19  56  30
2  97  52  52  40  44  24   2  37
3  68  90  27  67  71  22  60  84
4  91  80  13  44  56   9  11  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to satisfy envy-freeness as much as possible, meaning each agent should prefer their own bundle of items over those of others, based on their valuations. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items, we will start by identifying the most preferred items for each agent and then attempt to distribute them evenly.

First, let's assess the highest values for each agent and try to allocate based on their preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 5, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 3, 0, and 6.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 0, 1, and 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 1, 7, and 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 0, 1, and 7.

To prevent conflicts, we will attempt to allocate unique high-value items to each agent:

- **Agent 0**: Item 5 (95)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (99)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (97)
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (90)
- **Agent 4**: Item 7 (57)

This allocation leaves us with items 2, 4, and 6 still unallocated. We will assign these based on the next highest preferences among the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 5. Will be considered for item 6 (76).
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 3. Will be considered for item 4 (6).
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 0. Will be considered for item 2 (52).
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 1. Will be considered for item 4 (71).
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 7. Will be considered for item 2 (13).

After a careful re-evaluation to balance allocations, aiming for minimal envy:

- **Agent 0**: Items 5 and 4
- **Agent 1**: Items 3 and 6
- **Agent 2**: Item 0
- **Agent 3**: Items 1 and 2
- **Agent 4**: Item 7

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [7]
}
```
