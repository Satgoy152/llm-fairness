Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  52  23  30  34   7  78  67
1  78  95  89  52  55  89  25  49
2  55  77  86  28  63  67  92  40
3  32  24  48  87   1  20   8  89
4  82  42  37  18  46  17  45  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, meaning that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. Although achieving complete envy-freeness might not be possible due to the discrete nature of items, we can try to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent receives items that maximize their utility based on their valuations. 

Let's consider the following steps to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: Start by identifying which items each agent values the most.
2. **Allocate items to minimize envy**: Assign items such that each agent receives a bundle of items that is as close as possible to their most valued ones, while considering the distribution of items to avoid giving all high-valued items to a single agent.
3. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item**: Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, at least 3 agents will receive 2 items, while the other 2 agents will receive 1 item each.

Using these principles, I will allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly but also item 4 has a unique preference.

Given these preferences, we can try the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5 (Most valued: 0, 5 is a reasonable second option)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2 (Most valued: 1, 2 is a reasonable second option)
- Agent 2: Items 6 (Most valued: 6, only one item needed)
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7 (Most valued: 3, 7 is a reasonable second option)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (Most valued: 4, only one item needed)

This allocation attempts to satisfy the principle of minimizing envy by ensuring that each agent gets some of their highly valued items.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
