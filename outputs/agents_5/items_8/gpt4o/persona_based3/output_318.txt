Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  56  64  62   3  72  76  35
1   8  32  58  73  12  53  72  91
2  48  51   2  69  76  88   5  29
3  25  32  33  60  95  26  18   3
4  90   4  52  86  56  83  86  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a fair manner, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as what they would receive if they were to receive any other agent's allocation. However, since envy-freeness is a complex criterion to achieve exactly, especially with indivisible items and without compensation, we'll aim for an approximate solution. 

One approach is to use the method of "maximum sum of valuations" where we try to maximize the sum of each agent's valuation of the items they receive. While this won't necessarily achieve envy-freeness, it can help us approach a solution that feels fair in terms of the agents' valuations.

Here are the steps for allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: For each item, identify which agent values it the most and allocate that item to that agent.
2. **Adjust for Fairness**: Ensure that each agent gets a fair share by checking the number of items they receive and redistributing if necessary.

Let's allocate the items based on these considerations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values highest for item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Values highest for items 3 and 7.
3. **Agent 2**: Values highest for items 5 and 4.
4. **Agent 3**: Values highest for item 0.
5. **Agent 4**: Values highest for items 2 and 1.

Let's ensure each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: 6
- Agent 1: 3, 7
- Agent 2: 5, 4
- Agent 3: 0
- Agent 4: 2, 1

This allocation results in each agent receiving at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the highest valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints of indivisibility and the goal of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
