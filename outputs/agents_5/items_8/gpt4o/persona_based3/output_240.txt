Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  31  57  63  75  47  61  22
1  39  48   1  93  94  90  36  60
2  43   6  47  31  43  93  96  15
3  72   7  20  63  52  86  17  81
4  26  20  10  97  77  83  72  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items and attempt to balance the distribution so that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations provided, we can employ a fair division method such as the "round-robin" approach, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that is still available. This helps in reducing envy as each agent gets a chance to pick what they value most.

Here's a suggested allocation plan:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 0 (76), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 4 (94), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 6 (96), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 5 (86), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 3 (97), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

With these initial allocations, each agent has received their most valued available item. Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 1, 2, and 7.

6. For the remaining items:
   - **Agent 1** values item 7 (60) second after item 4, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
   - **Agent 0** values item 2 (57) second after item 0, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 3** now values item 1 (7) more than others, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent has been allocated items based on their preferences as much as possible. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
