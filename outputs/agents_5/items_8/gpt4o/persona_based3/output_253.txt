Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  73  52  77  58  11  44  31
1  44  51  36  39  14  21  32  29
2  60  49  10  99  84  41  27  45
3   0  77  89  40  77  67   9  51
4  49  75  18  42  94  20   8  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the method of ensuring each agent gets at least one item and trying to balance the overall valuations. We will aim for each agent to feel that they are receiving a fair share of their perceived total value of all items.

The total value each agent assigns to all items is as follows:
- Agent 0: \(44 + 73 + 52 + 77 + 58 + 11 + 44 + 31 = 390\)
- Agent 1: \(44 + 51 + 36 + 39 + 14 + 21 + 32 + 29 = 266\)
- Agent 2: \(60 + 49 + 10 + 99 + 84 + 41 + 27 + 45 = 415\)
- Agent 3: \(0 + 77 + 89 + 40 + 77 + 67 + 9 + 51 = 410\)
- Agent 4: \(49 + 75 + 18 + 42 + 94 + 20 + 8 + 45 = 351\)

The goal is to divide the items in such a way that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations. Here's one approach to do this, keeping envy-freeness in mind:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the most, so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most, so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most, but since it is already taken, assign item 4 (their second highest value) to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the most, so assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the most, but since it is already taken, assign item 0 (their second highest value) to Agent 4.
6. Now we need to allocate the remaining items: 5, 6, and 7.

Continuing with this allocation strategy, balancing the allocations:
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 to balance their perceived share.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 to maintain their balance.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 to keep it even.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This is an attempt to evenly distribute value and maintain fairness and envy-freeness as much as possible with the given valuations.
