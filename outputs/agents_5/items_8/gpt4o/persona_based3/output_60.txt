Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  85  90  32  95  42  19  40
1  55  94   7  66   5  29  70  69
2  94  11  81  42  67  97  91  29
3  79  79  63  28  45  16  20  13
4  11  38   3  29  96  96  14  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure an equitable distribution of value. Given the differences in valuations, a simple greedy approach where each agent picks their highest-valued item might not lead to an envy-free or fair division. Instead, I'll try to distribute items to balance the overall perceived value each agent receives.

Here's how the allocation can be performed:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are items 4 (95), 2 (90), and 1 (85).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are items 1 (94), 0 (55), and 3 (66).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are items 0 (94), 5 (97), and 6 (91).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are items 0 (79) and 1 (79).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are items 4 (96) and 5 (96).

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign item 2 (value 90) and item 7 (value 40).
- Agent 1: Assign item 1 (value 94).
- Agent 2: Assign item 5 (value 97).
- Agent 3: Assign item 0 (value 79).
- Agent 4: Assign item 4 (value 96) and item 3 (value 29).
- Remaining item 6 (value 70 for agent 1) can be assigned to agent 1 to balance their allocation.

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 3]
}
```

This allocation strives to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring all items are distributed among the agents.
