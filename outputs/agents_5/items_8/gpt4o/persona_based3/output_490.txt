Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  65  48  72  18  61  45  86
1  38   0  76  11   0  16  46  30
2  43  78  41  62  41  56  59  34
3  89  30  37  70  68  97  85  68
4  93  69  98  25  58  84  59  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the nature of this problem, achieving perfect envy-freeness may not be possible, but we can strive for a balanced allocation based on the highest valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (72) and 7 (86).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (76).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for item 1 (78) and item 6 (59).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (89) and 5 (97).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (98), but since Agent 1 has a very high valuation for this item, let's consider their next highest, item 0 (93).

Taking this into account, a possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 7
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 1, 6
- **Agent 3**: Item 5
- **Agent 4**: Item 0, 4

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one of their higher-valued items while ensuring that all items are allocated. It may not be perfectly envy-free, but it considers agents' preferences and attempts to distribute high-value items across agents.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and considers the preferences of each agent as much as possible given the constraints.
