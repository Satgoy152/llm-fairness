Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  12  40  61  44  68  76  89
1  55  82  85  60  66  21  25  71
2  26  39  22  45   7  64   2  26
3  54   3  94  58  62  45  67  16
4  99  69  68  12  39  52  39  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[53 12 40 61 44 68 76 89]
 [55 82 85 60 66 21 25 71]
 [26 39 22 45  7 64  2 26]
 [54  3 94 58 62 45 67 16]
 [99 69 68 12 39 52 39 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering individual valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One approach to achieve this is by using the maximum envy-free allocation strategy, which might not be perfectly envy-free but aims to minimize envy.

Let's analyze the given valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  12  40  61  44  68  76  89
1  55  82  85  60  66  21  25  71
2  26  39  22  45   7  64   2  26
3  54   3  94  58  62  45  67  16
4  99  69  68  12  39  52  39  17
```

We will consider the sum of each agent's values for all items and try to allocate items to maximize each agent's total perceived value while minimizing envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 7 (89) and 6 (76).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (85).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 5 (64).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 2 (94), but given to Agent 1, next highest are items 6 (67) and 3 (58).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 0 (99).

Allocate based on the highest value items available for each agent:

- Agent 0: Assign items [6, 7] (76, 89)
- Agent 1: Assign item [2] (85)
- Agent 2: Assign item [5] (64)
- Agent 3: Assign item [3] (58)
- Agent 4: Assign items [0, 1, 4] (99, 69, 39)

This allocation aims to maximize individual satisfaction with the given constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
