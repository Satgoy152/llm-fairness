Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  40  40  80  67  20  75   4
1  98   6  33  19   3  71  76  23
2  66  64  76  85  36  91   4  43
3  65  30   4  64  73   8  16  87
4  80  45  82  83  80  20   2  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents while considering fairness and envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the "maximum marginal utility" approach. This method involves assigning items to agents based on the highest additional value each item provides to an agent who hasn't yet received it, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: Create a list to keep track of which items have been allocated and to whom.

2. **Iteration**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most among those who have not already received an item. Assign the item to that agent.

3. **Repeat** until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this method:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is to agent 1 (98). Assign to agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is to agent 0 (40). Assign to agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is to agent 4 (82). Assign to agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is to agent 2 (85). Assign to agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is to agent 3 (73). Assign to agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is to agent 2, and agent 2 already has an item, so choose the next best available option. Assign to agent 1 (71).
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is to agent 0 (75). Assign to agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is to agent 3 (87). Assign to agent 3.

By following these steps, we ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and any conflicts are resolved by assigning to the next highest value available.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and reflects the highest utility-based distribution given the constraints.
