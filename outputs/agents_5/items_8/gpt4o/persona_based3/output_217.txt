Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  60   2   6  86  38  72  49
1  90  55   4  65  94  64   2  59
2  80  92  86  75  87   0   9  62
3  33  78  79  74   3  34  91  40
4  35  28  36  28  62  24  20  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that prioritizes envy-freeness, we need to distribute the items among the agents such that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. This problem can be complex due to the differing valuations and the need to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's approach this problem using a simple heuristic: allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most at 90. Allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most at 92. Allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the most at 79. Allocate to Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 65. Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 94. Allocate to Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most at 64. Allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most at 91. Allocate to Agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it the most at 77. Allocate to Agent 4.

### Final Allocation:

Given the above allocations, let's ensure each agent is included in the results:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 3, 4, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent is considered in the process. Agent 0, unfortunately, does not receive any items in this allocation, which is a limitation of this simple heuristic approach.
