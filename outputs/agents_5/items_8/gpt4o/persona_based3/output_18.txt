Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  83  14  85  13  80  26  96
1  75  99  16  10  17  97  69  40
2  93  19  77   3  60  13  49  99
3  25  29  93  46  41  33  26  60
4  44  74  29  32  99  92  33  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 8 items among the 5 agents with the goal of minimizing envy, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. This approach attempts to ensure that each agent feels they are getting a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- **Agent 0** values items significantly at 83, 85, 80, and 96.
- **Agent 1** values items significantly at 99, 97, and 75.
- **Agent 2** values items significantly at 93, 77, and 99.
- **Agent 3** values items significantly at 93 and 60.
- **Agent 4** values items significantly at 99, 98, and 92.

A fair allocation would aim to distribute these high-value items according to the preferences of each agent, while ensuring each agent receives a similar level of utility based on their highest-valued items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (Value 85), item 5 (Value 80)
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (Value 99), item 6 (Value 69)
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 7 (Value 99)
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 2 (Value 93)
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 4 (Value 99), item 0 (Value 44)

This allocation considers agents' highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and a total of 8 items are distributed.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 0]
}
```
