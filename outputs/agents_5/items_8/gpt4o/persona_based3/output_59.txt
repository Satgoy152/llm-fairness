Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  99  77   0  71   8  95  30
1  97  62  77   8  40  58  61  42
2  58  30  93  49  44  62  32  59
3  53  45  18  35   6  34  20  71
4  42  83   8  22  55  86  33  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the goal of achieving envy-freeness, we need to take into account the preferences and valuations each agent has for the items. Envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

One approach to solving this problem is to use a method such as the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most preferred item from the remaining pool of items. This can help in achieving an allocation that is close to envy-free, especially when valuations are diverse.

Here's a step-by-step plan to allocate items:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent across all items to assess their overall valuation profile.
2. Use a priority-based method to allow each agent to pick items in turn, giving priority based on their needs or some fairness criteria.
3. Ensure each agent ends up with at least one item if possible, given the constraint that all items must be allocated.

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 1 (value 99).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 0 (value 97).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 2 (value 93).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 7 (value 71).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 5 (value 86).

After each agent gets one item according to their highest valuation, we continue with the remaining items:

- Remaining items after the first allocation: 3, 4, 6.
- **Agent 0**: Next highest valuation is item 6 (value 95).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest valuation is item 4 (value 40).
- **Agent 4**: Next highest valuation is item 3 (value 22).

This allocation ensures each item is allocated and attempts to maximize each agentâ€™s satisfaction based on their individual valuation.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure fairness by giving each agent items they value highly relative to their preferences.
