Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  40  72  97  67  14  13  74   4
1  15  33  19  64  26  65  86  91
2  31  32  16   5  87  14  71  99
3  92  83  85  28  89  65  27  90
4  27  87  69  47  10  89  63  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their individual valuations, we can aim for an envy-free division where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as they value the bundle of any other agent.

First, let's summarize the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 377
- Agent 1: 399
- Agent 2: 355
- Agent 3: 559
- Agent 4: 450

We aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a bundle of items with a fair share of the total value they desire. Here's a proposed allocation approach that attempts to create a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 has high value for items 2 and 1, let's assign these to them.
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 7 highly, so let's assign that to them.
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 4 highly, so we can allocate that.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 and 3, so let's allocate those to them.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 significantly, but since Agent 0 already has it, we will assign items 5 and 6 which are also valuable to Agent 4.

Let's put this into our JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 8 items distributed, and attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible within the constraints.
