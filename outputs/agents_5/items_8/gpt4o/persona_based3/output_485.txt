Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  96  12  31  30  46  75  92
1  21  71  48  26  12  33  82  39
2  53  69  88  58  26  51   6  42
3  40  62  32  44  54   3  60  69
4  22  75  32  28  94  59  54  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives a set of items they value highly. One common approach is the envy-free allocation, which tries to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations provided, one way to approach this is to allocate items to maximize each agent's total valuation while trying to ensure fairness. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Assign the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (96).
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (82).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (88).
   - Agent 3 values item 7 the highest (69).
   - Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (94).

2. **Assign remaining items considering the next highest values and ensuring each gets an item:**
   - After assigning one item to each agent based on their highest value, the remaining items are 0, 3, 5. We assign these to balance out the total value each agent receives.

3. **Assignment based on remaining preferences:**
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (53).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (44).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (46).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [7, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while keeping the allocation fair.
