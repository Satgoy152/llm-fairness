Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  29  34  76   3  46  20  48
1  24  67  26  50  77  23  50  64
2  43  76  71  21  23  22  91  61
3  69  42  10  71  52  61   1  40
4  99  61  58  55   8  36  33  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a process that aims to achieve envy-freeness. This ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their individual valuations.

One method is to use a round-robin allocation process or a similar method to distribute the items, ensuring each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual valuation while trying to maintain balance across all agents. We will attempt to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as equal as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 3, which they value the highest at 76.
- Agent 1 gets item 4, which they value the highest at 77.
- Agent 2 gets item 6, which they value the highest at 91.
- Agent 3 gets item 5, which they value the highest at 61.
- Agent 4 gets item 0, which they value the highest at 99.
- Next, distribute the remaining items (1, 2, and 7) with consideration to balance:
  - Agent 2 also gets item 7 (value 61 for them), as they value it highly and have only one item so far.
  - Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 67 for them), which balances their total valuation.
  - Agent 4 gets item 2 (value 58 for them), balancing their allocation.

The allocations can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items among the agents and ensures each agent receives at least one item, with the goal of minimizing envy among them based on their individual preferences.
