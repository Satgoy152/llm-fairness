Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45   9  29  91   5  98  77   8
1  62   1  98  97  56  61  39  55
2  58  71  37  49  46   9  86  14
3  16  44  27  37  26  36  61  69
4  71  70   4  47  89  65  94  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 5 agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This involves considering each agent's valuation of the items and finding a distribution that minimizes envy.

To approach this problem, we can use a simple allocation strategy based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction iteratively. We will:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to agents one by one, starting with the agent who derives the highest value from an unallocated item.
3. Continue allocating until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1** values item 2 (value 98) most. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values item 5 (value 98) next. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
3. **Agent 4** values item 6 (value 94) next. Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
4. **Agent 4** also values item 7 (value 94) highly. Allocate item 7 to Agent 4.
5. **Agent 0** values item 3 (value 91) next. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 1** values item 3 (value 97) highly, but it's already taken. Next, item 0 (value 62) is of high value. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
7. **Agent 4** values item 4 (value 89) highly. Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
8. **Agent 2** values item 6 (value 86) highly, but it's already taken. Next, item 1 (value 71) is of high value. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

After this allocation, all items have been allocated, and the allocation ensures that each agent receives some of their most valued items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

Note: Agent 3 receives no items in this allocation as their highest valuations were already claimed by other agents with higher valuations for those items. This allocation attempts to balance the overall satisfaction based on initial preferences.
