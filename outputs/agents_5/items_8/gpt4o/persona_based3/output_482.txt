Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  77  31   0  92  92  26  75
1  56  45  19  12  50  65  32   5
2  55  83  62  56  28  47  56  53
3  10  23   0  17  30  85  70  55
4  33  79  18   3  28  94  45  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations. This is a challenging task, especially when the number of items does not evenly divide by the number of agents, but we will aim for a balanced allocation.

Given the preferences, we can try to allocate the items based on maximizing individual satisfaction while ensuring every item is allocated.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for items 4 and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 0 and 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values items 1 and 2 highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a preference for items 5 and 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers items 5 and 7.

Considering these preferences, we attempt a balanced allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Let's allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 0 as they have high value for them.
- **Agent 1**: Given its preference, allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, which is highly valued.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 3 and 6 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 7 to Agent 4.

### Allocations in JSON format:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value and preferences each agent has for their items, ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible given the constraints.
