Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  58  64  75  19  89  19   7
1  50  19  19  24  57   1  23  36
2  32  31  38  49  88  24   8  20
3   7  90  15  48  51  34  12  52
4  97  25  23  76  51  24  45  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives, ensuring that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraint of integer assignments. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [5, 58, 64, 75, 19, 89, 19, 7]
   - High-value items for Agent 0: 5 (value 89), 3 (value 75)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [50, 19, 19, 24, 57, 1, 23, 36]
   - High-value items for Agent 1: 0 (value 50), 4 (value 57)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [32, 31, 38, 49, 88, 24, 8, 20]
   - High-value items for Agent 2: 4 (value 88), 3 (value 49)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [7, 90, 15, 48, 51, 34, 12, 52]
   - High-value items for Agent 3: 1 (value 90), 7 (value 52)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Values: [97, 25, 23, 76, 51, 24, 45, 10]
   - High-value items for Agent 4: 0 (value 97), 3 (value 76)

Given these valuations, we need to allocate the items such that no agent envies another. Here's one way to do this:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value 89).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 88).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 90).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (value 97).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (value 76).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value 64).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 23).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (value 36).

The allocations can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible, while also ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
