Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  67  23  70  35   1  51  13
1  59  84  61  96  12  89  77  94
2  18  16  56  43  26  99  75  38
3  41  20  34  73  46  59  85   1
4  80  48  17  43  77  26  25  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as or better than the allocation of any other agent. A common approach is to try to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring envy-freeness, though finding an exact envy-free allocation with indivisible goods is challenging. We aim to minimize envy by closely matching agents' preferences to the items they receive.

Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** seems to value items 0 and 3 highly, so we can give them item 0.
2. **Agent 1** values items 1 and 3 the most, so we can give them item 3.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 highly, so we can give them item 5.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the most, so we can give them item 6.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 and 7 highly, so we can give them item 4.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items 1, 2, and 7.

- **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 1; hence, give them item 1.
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 7 and 2, so we give them item 7.
- **Agent 2** can receive item 2, as it has a decent valuation for it.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to satisfy each agent's preferences reasonably well, given the constraints of indivisible items.
