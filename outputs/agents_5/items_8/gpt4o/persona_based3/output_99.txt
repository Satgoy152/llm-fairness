Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  57  77  62  98  38  39  65
1   2  34  74  69  40  11  56  58
2  60  46  47  48  11  82  86  64
3  23  94  39  27  15  74  22  70
4   7  19  42  63  90  45  81  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To find a fair allocation of the items among the agents such that envy-freeness is achieved, we need to ensure that each agent feels that their allocation is at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuation.

Let's start by considering a simple approach using the maximum valuation method, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. This method may not always lead to an envy-free allocation, but we'll use it as a starting point and adjust as needed.

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 67.
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 94.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 77.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 62.
5. Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 98.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 82.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 86.
8. Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most at 70.

Now, let's check the number of items allocated to each agent:

- Agent 0: 4 items (0, 2, 3, 4)
- Agent 1: 0 items
- Agent 2: 2 items (5, 6)
- Agent 3: 2 items (1, 7)
- Agent 4: 0 items

Since Agent 1 and Agent 4 have no items, we need to redistribute to ensure that each agent receives at least one item:

1. Reallocate Item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it second most.
2. Reallocate Item 4 from Agent 0 to Agent 4, as Agent 4 values it second most.

Now we have:

- Agent 0: 2 items (0, 2)
- Agent 1: 1 item (3)
- Agent 2: 2 items (5, 6)
- Agent 3: 2 items (1, 7)
- Agent 4: 1 item (4)

All items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```
