Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  76  91  55  20  91  12  74
1  20  62  66  78  23  98  91  98
2  38  87   1  11   4  59  44  53
3  85  57  11  84  76  56  13  97
4  66  77   8  69  70  60  37  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we must consider the valuations of each agent for the items and aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as any other agent from their own perspective.

One possible approach is to use a round-robin method, where each agent picks their most-valued item from the remaining items in a sequence, or to use an optimization method like the adjusted winner procedure to ensure fairness and envy-freeness. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness and the limited number of items and agents, I will attempt to distribute the items in a way that approximates fairness.

Here is an allocation strategy that aims to distribute the items fairly based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 2 and 5.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 5 and 7.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 1 and 5.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 0 and 7.
5. **Agent 4** highly values items 1 and 4.

Given the constraints, we can attempt to distribute items to maximize total valuations per agent while trying to ensure no agent envies another for a better allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 7
- **Agent 2**: Item 1
- **Agent 3**: Item 0
- **Agent 4**: Items 4, 6

Here's how the allocations look in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
