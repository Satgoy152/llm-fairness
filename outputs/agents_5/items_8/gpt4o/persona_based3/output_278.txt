Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  78  59  61  50   5  70  37
1  56   8   7   5  27  65  59  72
2  81  70  33  75  66  82   8  65
3  23  67  21  66  28  20  98  37
4  20  12  20  16   7  46   4  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the "Adjusted Winner" algorithm or similar heuristic methods. A simple approach here is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each item is only assigned once and that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Given the agents' valuations, the goal is to allocate the items such that the total value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible, reducing or eliminating envy. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly (78), so we assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 highly (72), so we assign item 7 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly (82), so we assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 highly (98), so we assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 doesn't have any item with a valuation above 50, so we can assign the remaining items in a way that balances the allocation.

Continuing with this method, we try to balance the remaining items among the agents:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (59), as it adds the most value for them.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (81), as it adds the most value for them.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (28), as it balances their allocation.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (16), as it adds the most value for them.

This allocation achieves a reasonable balance based on initial high valuations and tries to minimize envy by balancing total perceived value.

Therefore, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, minimizing envy based on their valuations.
