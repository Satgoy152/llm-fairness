Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  57  21  52  43  86  71  86
1  76  94  10  64  62  67  52  61
2  63   3  72  38  36  39  58   0
3  33  73  29  53  12  83   8  23
4  90  50  14  52   7  64  29  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they do not envy compared to others, given their own valuation of the items.

One effective method for achieving this is the "round-robin" approach, where agents take turns picking their most preferred available item until all items are allocated. This method attempts to reduce envy by allowing agents to prioritize their choices based on their personal valuations.

Here's how we can apply the round-robin method with the given data:

1. **Initial Setup**: Sort agents by their total valuation of all items, from highest to lowest, to determine the picking order. This allows agents who value items more overall to have priority in the first round.

2. **Allocation Process**: 
   - Round 1: Each agent picks their highest-valued item that is still available.
   - Round 2: Continue picking in the same order until all items are allocated.

Below are the detailed steps and allocations:

- **Agent 1** (Total Valuation = 486) picks first. Highest value item: 1 (94).
- **Agent 0** (Total Valuation = 460) picks next. Highest value item: 5 (86).
- **Agent 4** (Total Valuation = 380) picks next. Highest value item: 0 (90).
- **Agent 3** (Total Valuation = 314) picks next. Highest value item: 5 (83, already taken). Next highest: 1 (73).
- **Agent 2** (Total Valuation = 309) picks next. Highest value item: 2 (72).

Start the second round of picking:

- **Agent 1** picks next. Highest available: 3 (64).
- **Agent 0** picks next. Highest available: 7 (86).
- **Agent 4** picks next. Highest available: 4 (7, but 52 is available at 3).

The final allocations will be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution by allowing agents to choose items they value more, reducing potential envy and ensuring that all items are allocated.
