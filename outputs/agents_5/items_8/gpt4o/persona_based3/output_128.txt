Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  69  33  66  16  99  79  95
1  74  49  67  51  63  16   4  82
2  96  33  16  99  46  69  98  17
3  21  97  53  45   7   3  99  36
4  54  61  41  64   9   4  12  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, ensuring that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we will perform a round-robin assignment based on the highest value items for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item before any agent gets a second item, if possible.

Let's evaluate the strategy:

### Step 1: Initial Allocation
1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is item 5 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is item 0 (74).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is item 0 (96) - already taken, so choose item 6 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is item 6 (99) - already taken, so choose item 1 (97).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is item 3 (64).

### Step 2: Second Round Allocation (Unallocated Items: 2, 4, 7)
1. **Agent 0**: Next highest available item is item 7 (95).
2. **Agent 1**: Next highest available item is item 7 (82) - already taken, so choose item 2 (67).
3. **Agent 2**: No items left for allocation in this round.
4. **Agent 3**: No items left for allocation in this round.
5. **Agent 4**: Next highest available item is item 2 (41) - already taken, so choose item 4 (9).

### Final Allocations

Based on the above allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the distribution is as fair as possible given the constraints.
