Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  41  91  39  27  13  84   4
1  49  89  46  18  20  28  94  40
2  28  49   3  47   6   6  39  95
3  79  35  94   8  69  28  57  27
4  20   3   1  77  67   5  49   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation. Given the valuations table, a good approach is to use a method like the Envy-Free Matching or a similar fair division algorithm. However, since we're working with a small number of items and agents, let's use an intuitive approach by considering each agent's highest valued items and then check for fairness and balance.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:
1. **Identify High-Valued Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: High valuations are for items 2 (91) and 6 (84).
   - Agent 1: High valuations are for items 6 (94) and 1 (89).
   - Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 7 (95).
   - Agent 3: High valuations are for items 2 (94) and 0 (79).
   - Agent 4: High valuations are for items 3 (77) and 4 (67).

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Preferences:**
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 (highest bid).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (highest bid).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (highest bid).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4 (highest bid).

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 0's next high valuation is item 0 (69).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (second highest bid after item 6).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 4 (second highest bid after item 3).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (next available with decent value).

4. **Final Allocations Check:**
   - Ensure each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation seeks to respect each agent's preferences, balancing high-value items across agents to minimize envy. Each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 8.
