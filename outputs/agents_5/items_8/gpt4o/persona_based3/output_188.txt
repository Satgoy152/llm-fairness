Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  72  89   6  63  89  98  60
1  14  19  46  22   2  92   1  16
2  18  69   8  78   6  14  89  29
3  58  35  54  34  74  27  97  55
4   7  12  12  31  18  55   8  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where each agent believes they have received a fair share compared to others. However, given the discrete nature of the items and the varying preferences, achieving complete envy-freeness might not be possible, but we can strive for a fair approach.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 526
   - Agent 1: 212
   - Agent 2: 311
   - Agent 3: 434
   - Agent 4: 228

2. **Estimate a Fair Share:**
   - The sum of all valuations across all agents is 1711.
   - Each agent's fair share, in terms of valuation, could be estimated as 1711 / 5 = 342.2.

3. **Allocate Items to Maximize Each Agent's Perceived Value:**
   - Focus on distributing the items so that each agent's total valuation is as close as possible to their fair share while ensuring each item is allocated exactly once.

4. **Prioritize High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Allocate the most valued items for each agent first, then proceed to allocate others until all items are distributed.

Here is a feasible allocation based on the above strategy:

- **Agent 0:** [0, 6] — Total value: 49 + 98 = 147
- **Agent 1:** [5] — Total value: 92
- **Agent 2:** [3, 7] — Total value: 78 + 29 = 107
- **Agent 3:** [2, 4] — Total value: 54 + 74 = 128
- **Agent 4:** [1] — Total value: 12

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that maximize their perceived value, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all 8 items are allocated. Note that while perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable due to the discrete nature of the items, this distribution attempts to be fair given the constraints.
