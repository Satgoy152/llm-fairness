Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  98  95  67  61  22  31  67
1  58  68  20  46  72  30  40   4
2  47  39  63  52  12   8  18  69
3  92  46  81  50   5  58  82  90
4  40  62  47  20  25  44  66  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to either minimize envy or achieve an envy-free allocation. Given the complexity and constraints, let's attempt a simple allocation approach while keeping in mind the values agents have for each item.

One possible approach is to use a "round-robin" method where we assign items to agents based on their highest valuation that hasn't already been allocated. This method won't necessarily be envy-free, but it can provide a reasonable distribution.

Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is item 0 (92), so assign item 0 to agent 3.
2. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is item 1 (98), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 2 (95), so assign item 2 to agent 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Next highest is item 7 (90), so assign item 7 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 3**: Next highest unallocated is item 6 (82), so assign item 6 to agent 3.
6. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is item 4 (72), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
7. **Agent 4**: Highest unallocated is item 5 (44), so assign item 5 to agent 4.
8. **Agent 2**: Highest unallocated is item 3 (52), so assign item 3 to agent 2.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 7, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated once, and all agents are considered in the distribution process.
