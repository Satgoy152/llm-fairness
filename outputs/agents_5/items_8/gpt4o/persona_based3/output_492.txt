Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  71  89  70  67  12  69  69
1   0  73  53   2  48  72  83  14
2   0  96   1  63  42  57  67  50
3  23  77  89  82  55  42  21  88
4  80  73   4  33  84  82   0   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use an approach that aims to achieve an envy-free allocation, where no agent would prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own. This is often challenging to achieve perfectly, but we can strive for a reasonable balance given the valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: First, identify items that have significantly higher valuations for specific agents compared to others. This helps in reducing potential envy.

2. **Assign Items to Agents**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.

3. **Iterate for Balance**: If needed, iterate the allocation to balance the distribution of total utility/value each agent receives.

Let's see how this works with the given data:

- **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 2 (89) and 1 (71).
- **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 6 (83).
- **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 1 (96).
- **Agent 3**: High valuations for items 2 (89), 7 (88), and 3 (82).
- **Agent 4**: High valuations for items 0 (80) and 4 (84).

Considering these observations, we can propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 2]
- **Agent 1**: Items [6]
- **Agent 2**: Items [1]
- **Agent 3**: Items [3, 7]
- **Agent 4**: Items [4, 5]

By this allocation, we aim to allocate items based on high valuation preferences while keeping a balance of total items assigned to each agent. This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their high-value items, reducing potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation uses all 8 items, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
