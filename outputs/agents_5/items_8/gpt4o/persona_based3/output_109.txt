Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89   3  94  75  21  49   9  53
1  83  37  80  83  74  31   4   8
2  12  73  59  23  24  53  96  37
3  86  48  19  44  73  42  88  55
4  74  26   9  94  10  61  57   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation, we can use the concept of maximizing the Nash welfare, which is the product of the utilities that each agent derives from their allocation. This approach attempts to balance efficiency and fairness by ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their utility while considering the utilities of others.

Given the valuations table, we proceed by allocating items to agents in a manner that seeks to maximize the Nash welfare:

### Agents and Their Valuations:
- **Agent 0**: [89, 3, 94, 75, 21, 49, 9, 53]
- **Agent 1**: [83, 37, 80, 83, 74, 31, 4, 8]
- **Agent 2**: [12, 73, 59, 23, 24, 53, 96, 37]
- **Agent 3**: [86, 48, 19, 44, 73, 42, 88, 55]
- **Agent 4**: [74, 26, 9, 94, 10, 61, 57, 8]

### Allocation:
1. **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 0 (highest value: 94)
2. **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 3 (second highest value: 86)
3. **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 4 (highest value: 94)
4. **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 2 (highest value: 96)
5. **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 1 (highest value: 74)
6. **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 4 (next highest value: 61)
7. **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 2 (next highest value: 73)
8. **Item 7**: Allocate to Agent 3 (next highest value: 55)

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 8.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution considers each agent's preferences to enhance fairness and minimize envy.
