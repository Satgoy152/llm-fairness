Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  45  35  21  88  24  62  70
1  16  81   2  54  65  36  87  11
2  69  88  37  15  46  36  31  25
3  42  75  36  64  27  82  60  89
4  50  35  63  36   7  14  82  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among 5 agents, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy, although achieving complete envy-freeness with indivisible items is challenging. We will consider a simple approach to allocate the items by maximizing the total valuation each agent receives, while trying to balance the allocations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations on items 0 and 4, so we allocate those items to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly. We assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation on item 2, so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation on item 7; thus, we allocate item 7 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation on item 6, so we assign item 6 to agent 4.
6. Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 3 and 5. We aim to balance the number of items each agent receives:
   - **Agent 1** has currently received only 1 item, so we give item 3 to them.
   - **Agent 2** also has received only 1 item, so we allocate item 5 to them.

Final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are allocated in a way that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences.
