Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  29  83  81  46  42  50   3
1  58  56  50   8  35  69  96  68
2  21   3  83  90  44  31  41  74
3   9  84  16  92  99  75  28  78
4  49  35  64  39  90  74  78  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the five agents, we will use a method that seeks to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an allocation that reflects their preferences as closely as possible. Here is one possible allocation based on the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2, so we assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 6, so we assign item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 3, so we assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4, so we assign item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 5, so we assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 0, 1, and 7. Let's evaluate based on the remaining highest valuations:

6. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most after item 2; thus, we assign item 0 to Agent 0.
7. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most after item 4; thus, we assign item 1 to Agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most after item 3; thus, we assign item 7 to Agent 2.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items among the agents while taking into account their preferences as much as possible, aiming to be envy-free and fair.
