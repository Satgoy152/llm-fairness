Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  44  96   3  19  43  72  45
1  63  96  12   9  91  39  69  98
2  31  75   9  82  86  19  67  83
3  41   1  62  82  66  28  86  33
4  21  46  40  82  83  77  50  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the 8 items among the 5 agents, we aim to create an allocation that is envy-free to the extent possible. This means we want each agent to feel that their share is at least as good as any other agent's share based on their own valuations.

The given valuations matrix is as follows:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
    0  28  44  96   3  19  43  72  45
    1  63  96  12   9  91  39  69  98
    2  31  75   9  82  86  19  67  83
    3  41   1  62  82  66  28  86  33
    4  21  46  40  82  83  77  50  26
```

To allocate these items fairly:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 2 (96) and item 6 (72).  
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (96) and item 7 (98).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (86) and item 7 (83).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 6 (86) and item 3 (82).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 4 (83) and item 3 (82).

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for them).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for them).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest value for them).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (highest value for them).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (one of the highest values for them).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 0, 5, and 7.

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (next highest value).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (next highest value).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (next highest value).

Thus, a feasible allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuation, aiming for an envy-free distribution where possible.
