Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  28  40   3  92  87  31  35
1  60  42  55  12  50  98  94  24
2  86  61  30   9  96  52  20  14
3  44  82  50  82  55  26  29  46
4  87  64  39  72  62  77  98  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the valuations. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and make decisions accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest at 92. Their second highest is item 5 at 87.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the highest at 98. Their second highest is item 6 at 94.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest at 96. Their second highest is item 0 at 86.
4. **Agent 3**: Values items 1 and 3 equally highest at 82. Their next highest is item 7 at 46.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 the highest at 98. Their second highest is item 7 at 90.

Given these valuations, let's proceed with an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 4 and 5, as they are among the highest valued by them and highly valued by others, but agent 0 has high valuations for them.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 6, as it's their second highest and not yet allocated.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 and 2, since item 0 is highly valued by them and item 2 is less contested.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 1 and 3, as they have the highest equal valuation for them and are less contested.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 7, as it is their second highest valued item and less contested after assigning other items.

This allocation respects the highest preferences of agents as much as possible while ensuring each agent ends up with some items.

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [7]
}
```
