Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  58  27   4   0  95  76  59
1  28  58  47   6   8  31  66  81
2  78  95  49  12  33  52  71   6
3  55  26  19  29  76  75  94   7
4   2  60  15  97  55  74  17  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent envies another's allocation. Given the valuations matrix, one approach to achieve this is to use the Envy-Free algorithm with the concept of maximizing minimum utility.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 5 highly (95) and also has a high value for item 0 (77). Allocating these items would maximize their utility.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 7 highly (81) and has a relatively high valuation for item 6 (66). Allocating these items would maximize their utility.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 1 (95) and a relatively high valuation for item 2 (49). Allocating these items would maximize their utility.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 6 (94) and a relatively high valuation for item 4 (76). Allocating item 4 to this agent is optimal, but since item 6 is allocated, we can consider item 3, which has a decent value (29).

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 3 highly (97) and item 7 (84). Allocating these items would maximize their utility.

Let's finalize the allocations based on these considerations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives bundles of items that maximize their valuations and attempts to minimize envy between agents. Note that item 4 was given to agent 3, and agent 4 received item 3 to balance the distribution of highly valued items.
