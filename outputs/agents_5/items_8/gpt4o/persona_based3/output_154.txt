Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  87  98  39  70  75  80  64
1   6  87  73  85  56  23  19  48
2  30  74  53   3  23  84  60  80
3  50  47  87  92   9  75  10  33
4   2   9  22  63  53  95  72  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can consider the agents' valuations and try to allocate items such that each agent perceives their bundle of items as valuable as possible. This is a challenging problem, and perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable, but we can aim to minimize envy.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 0, 1, and 2.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 5 and 7.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 3, but since it is already allocated to Agent 1, we can consider item 6.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 5, but since it is already allocated to Agent 2, we can consider other items.

Using this strategy, we can try the following allocation:

- Give Agent 0 items 0 and 2.
- Give Agent 1 item 3.
- Give Agent 2 items 5 and 7.
- Give Agent 3 item 6.
- Give Agent 4 items 1 and 4.

This way, each agent has a bundle that includes some of their most valued items, aiming to balance the overall satisfaction.

The allocations in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
