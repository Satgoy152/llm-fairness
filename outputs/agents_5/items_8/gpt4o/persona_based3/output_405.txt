Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  10  67  11  22  14  47   7
1  22  57  61  48  30  82  26  72
2  39  65  12  97  86  38  74  73
3  95  32  45  39  67  17  65  13
4   1  74  49  70  82  58  33  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, not every agent will receive the same number of items, but we will strive to allocate items in such a way that minimizes envy.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - There are 8 items and 5 agents, so some agents will receive more items than others.
   - We want to ensure that each agent feels their allocation is fair given their own valuations.

2. **Greedy Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This is a simple heuristic that often leads to fair outcomes.

3. **Initial Allocations:**
   - Item 0 (value 95) is most valued by Agent 3.
   - Item 1 (value 74) is most valued by Agent 4.
   - Item 2 (value 67) is most valued by Agent 0.
   - Item 3 (value 97) is most valued by Agent 2.
   - Item 4 (value 86) is most valued by Agent 2.
   - Item 5 (value 82) is most valued by Agent 1.
   - Item 6 (value 74) is most valued by Agent 2.
   - Item 7 (value 72) is most valued by Agent 1.

4. **Review and Adjust Allocations:**
   - Agent 2 has received 3 items (3, 4, and 6).
   - Agents 0, 1, and 4 have received 1 item each.
   - Agent 3 has received 1 item.
   - Item 7 is currently assigned to Agent 1, who also has Item 5.

5. **Final Adjustments:**
   - To ensure all items are allocated and to balance the distribution, we can adjust the allocation of some items.
   - Transfer Item 4 from Agent 2 to Agent 4, as Agent 4 values it second highest after Agent 2, and Agent 4 currently has only 1 item.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations, while all items are distributed among the agents.
