Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  70  91  72  55  49   4  30
1  66  52  11  36  38  50  40   8
2  18  96  80  77  79  70  74  41
3  92  39  57  91   8  56  75   7
4  70  52  83  29  57   0  40  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a heuristic approach. This involves trying to balance the total value each agent receives, based on their own valuations, and ensuring that each agent feels they received a fair share relative to their preferences.

Let's consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to allocate them in a manner that attempts to balance the perceived total value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0** prefers items with high values such as 91 (item 2), 79 (item 0), and 72 (item 3).
2. **Agent 1** has a relatively lower valuation across items, with 66 (item 0) and 52 (item 1) being higher.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest at 96, followed by items 2 and 3.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 6.
5. **Agent 4** values items 2 and 0 quite highly.

Given these preferences, we can attempt the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 0 and 2, their top two preferences.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 4 and 5, which are moderate in their preference list.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 1, which is their highest preference.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 3 and 6, both of which are highly valued by them.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate items 7, which is less preferred by others but reasonable for them.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a reasonable share according to their valuation, and no items are left unallocated.
