Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  99  59  67  15  74  77  86
1  59   3  44  74  21  33  50  79
2  82  90  17  27  53  71  56  43
3  47  42  50  19  87  79  25   2
4  33   1  20  71  43  78  63  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we strive to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and distributes the items based on the agents' valuations. We can use the concept of envy-freeness, aiming to ensure no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the matrix of valuations, a natural approach is to apply a round-robin algorithm to allocate items in a way that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their preferences. We will apply this method and allocate one item per round to each agent, considering their highest-valued available item in each round.

Here is the allocation of items to agents:

1. **Round 1 Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives item 1 (value 99).
   - Agent 1 receives item 7 (value 79).
   - Agent 2 receives item 0 (value 82).
   - Agent 3 receives item 4 (value 87).
   - Agent 4 receives item 5 (value 78).

2. **Round 2 Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 receives item 7 (value 86).
   - Agent 1 receives item 3 (value 74).
   - Agent 2 receives item 5 (value 71).
   - Agent 3 receives item 2 (value 50).
   - Agent 4 receives item 6 (value 63).

3. **Final Adjustments**:
   - Remove duplicate allocations and adjust, ensuring that only 8 items are allocated in total.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 2],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute items based on individual agent valuations while ensuring no agent is left without any items, and each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.
