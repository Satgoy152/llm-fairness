Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  63  52  61  77  86  42   1
1  70  41  68  33  38  68  13  52
2  16  96  45  87  10  58  31  21
3  62  40  59  17  76  20  85  44
4  31  92  51  28  30  85  36  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [70 41 68 33 38 68 13 52]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must consider the valuations and attempt to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, let's analyze and allocate items in a way that approximates fairness:

1. Agent 0 values items 5 and 4 highly. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 significantly. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 the highest. Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the least, so we may avoid allocating this, but item 1 is preferred and already allocated. Agent 4's next best is item 5, which is allocated. Let's re-evaluate based on remaining items.
6. Re-assess based on what's free and remaining preferences:
   - Agent 0 has item 5, let's add item 4 which is their next high preference.
   - Agent 2 has item 1, let's add item 3 which is still a high preference and available.
   - Agent 3 has item 6, let's add item 0 as it wasn't the highest but available.
   - Agent 4 can take item 7 now, avoiding previous conflicts.

The final allocation aims to minimize potential envy:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 5 which are among their top valuations.
- Agent 1 gets item 2, which they value the most.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3, meeting one of their highest preferences.
- Agent 3 gets items 0 and 6, aligning with top valuations.
- Agent 4 ends up with item 7, which is left over after distributing higher valued items to others.

This allocation attempts to balance preferences and fairness to the extent possible with the given data.
