Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  69  79   5   1  26  41  53
1  54  46  81  94   8  90  71  22
2   6  54  56  60  64  85  64  46
3  10  94  37  35  80  70  47  30
4  43  35  90  23  15  18  63  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets items that maximize their valuation, while also considering the concept of envy-freeness where possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value 79)
   - Second highest: Item 1 (value 69)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (value 94)
   - Second highest: Item 5 (value 90)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: Item 5 (value 85)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (value 64)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item: Item 1 (value 94)
   - Second highest: Item 4 (value 80)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (value 90)
   - Second highest: Item 6 (value 63)

Given the above high-value selections and ensuring that each item is allocated only once, we can adjust the allocations as follows to ensure every item is distributed:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 7
- Agent 1: Items 3, 5
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 2, 4

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed and that agents receive items that are generally valued highly by them, balancing fairness and efficiency.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
