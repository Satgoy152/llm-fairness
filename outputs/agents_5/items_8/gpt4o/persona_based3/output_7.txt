Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36   2  21  84  15  36   6  17
1  77   5   6  57  65  67  22  32
2  17  27  21  94  26  99  63  32
3  21  69  76  21  97  48  24  74
4  33  36  98  53  87   3  68  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to minimize envy, such as the envy-free criterion or the maximin criterion. Given the table of valuations, we'll aim to distribute the items in such a way that the overall satisfaction or utility of allocations is balanced among the agents.

Let's analyze the table to understand how we might allocate these items:

1. **Agent 0:** High value on item 3 (84).
2. **Agent 1:** High value on item 0 (77).
3. **Agent 2:** High value on item 5 (99).
4. **Agent 3:** High value on item 4 (97).
5. **Agent 4:** High value on item 2 (98).

After assigning these high-value items to the respective agents, we can then distribute the remaining items to balance the allocations further:

- Give item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Give item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Give item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Give item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
- Give item 2 to Agent 4 (highest value for Agent 4).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 6, 7) to the agents in a way that attempts to balance the remaining value:

- **Item 1:** Agent 3 has a relatively high value for item 1 (69), so assign it to Agent 3.
- **Item 6:** Agent 2 values item 6 (63), assign it to Agent 2.
- **Item 7:** Agent 4 has a decent value for item 7 (54), assign it to Agent 4.

By following this approach, each agent gets at least one item, and the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [4, 1],
    "4": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the high-value items among the agents, aiming for a fair and envy-free distribution based on the valuations given.
