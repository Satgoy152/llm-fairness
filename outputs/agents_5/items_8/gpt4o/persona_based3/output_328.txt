Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  68  79  35  23  93  96   4
1  94  83   7  50   4  39  82  11
2  19   6  60  68  60  42  61  69
3   0   1  88   8  50   1  37  98
4  93   1  88  92  55  47  66  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations and the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should prefer their own allocation over any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [87, 68, 79, 35, 23, 93, 96,  4]
Agent 1: [94, 83,  7, 50,  4, 39, 82, 11]
Agent 2: [19,  6, 60, 68, 60, 42, 61, 69]
Agent 3: [ 0,  1, 88,  8, 50,  1, 37, 98]
Agent 4: [93,  1, 88, 92, 55, 47, 66, 35]
```

We will allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while trying to distribute the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 6 and 5. 
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 0 and 1.
3. **Agent 2** values items 3 and 7 the most.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 and item 7.
5. **Agent 4** highly values items 4 and 3.

Let's allocate items based on these preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Items [5, 6] (Total valuation = 93 + 96 = 189)
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 1] (Total valuation = 94 + 83 = 177)
- **Agent 2**: Item [3] (Total valuation = 68)
- **Agent 3**: Item [2] (Total valuation = 88)
- **Agent 4**: Items [4, 7] (Total valuation = 55 + 35 = 90)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one of their top-valued items, and the total number of items allocated is 8. The allocation should minimize envy since each agent receives items they highly value.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
