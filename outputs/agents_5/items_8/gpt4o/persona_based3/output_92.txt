Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  64  24  15  68   9  12  23
1  68  24  49  29  89  13  67  72
2  58  65  39  86   4  23  47  36
3  87  37  68  32  91  45   0  16
4  77   4  40  64  93  70  49   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the five agents, we aim to allocate items such that each agent feels they are getting a fair share according to their valuations. One common approach to achieve fairness is to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 0 and 4. Allocating these items to agent 0 could maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 4 and 7. Since item 4 is already allocated to agent 0, we can allocate item 7 to agent 1, which is their second-highest valued item.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 3. Allocating item 3 to agent 2 would be beneficial for them.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values items 0 and 4, but since these are allocated to other agents, we can allocate item 5 to agent 3, which is their third-highest valued item.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent highly values item 4 and then item 5, but these are already allocated. We can allocate item 6 to agent 4, which is their next highest valued item.

After considering the above allocations, we need to adjust to ensure all items are allocated:

- **Item 2** can be allocated to agent 3, as agent 3 has a relatively high value for this item.
- **Item 1** can be allocated to agent 2, as agent 2 has a higher valuation for it compared to other unallocated items.

With this allocation strategy, each agent receives items they highly value, and all items are allocated. Let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and aims for fairness by considering the agents' valuations.
