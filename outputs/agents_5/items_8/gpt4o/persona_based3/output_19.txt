Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  47  73  77  68  95  91  79
1  18   8  76  40  89  76  45  81
2  32  75  57  42  28  22  20  61
3  36  78  62  50  18  14   8  78
4  93  92   3  58  17  85  62  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible or at least a fair division that minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation ensures that each agent feels they received a fair share compared to others, based on their own valuations.

Given the matrix of valuations, let's proceed with an allocation method that considers these valuations:

1. **Highest Value Allocation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This will help minimize envy as each agent receives items they value highly.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 93 by Agent 4.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 92 by Agent 4.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 76 by Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 77 by Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 89 by Agent 1.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 91 by Agent 0.
- **Item 7**: Highest value is 81 by Agent 1.

Now let's allocate these items to the agents, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3, 5, 6
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 4, 7
- **Agent 2**: No items (since items need to be allocated based on valuations and Agent 2 has lower valuations compared to others for these items)
- **Agent 3**: No items (similar reasoning as for Agent 2)
- **Agent 4**: Items 0, 1

Now, let's present this allocation in JSON format as requested:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [2, 4, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it most highly, thus minimizing potential envy.
