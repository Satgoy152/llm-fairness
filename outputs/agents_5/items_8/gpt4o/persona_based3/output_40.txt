Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  11  38  26  99  60  66  39
1  30  81  67  47  99  27  11  44
2  13  70  34  13  54  89   5  48
3  77  94  75  34  84  98  73   1
4  69  47  72  73  89  84  78  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. The goal is to create an allocation that minimizes the difference in perceived value among the agents.

Here's a step-by-step approach to find a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 401
   - Agent 1: 406
   - Agent 2: 326
   - Agent 3: 536
   - Agent 4: 557

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Fairness:**
   - Start by assigning each agent their most valued item that hasn't been assigned yet.
   - Attempt to balance the total value of items given to each agent.

3. **Item Assignments:**
   - Begin with the highest-valued items and assign them to the agents who value them the most.
   - Avoid creating a situation where one agent holds a significantly higher total value than others to minimize envy.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Assign items [4, 6] (Values: 99, 66)
- **Agent 1:** Assign items [1] (Values: 81)
- **Agent 2:** Assign items [5, 2] (Values: 89, 34)
- **Agent 3:** Assign items [3, 0] (Values: 34, 77)
- **Agent 4:** Assign items [7] (Values: 45)

This allocation attempts to give each agent a selection of items that maximizes their individual value while maintaining a balance across all agents to minimize envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, aiming to achieve a fair division based on the given valuations.
