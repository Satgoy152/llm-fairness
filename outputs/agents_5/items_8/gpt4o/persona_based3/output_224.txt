Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  11  39  86  48   8  13  16
1  49  10  18   1  66  99  69  23
2  19   0  78  87  35  19  81  94
3  25  85  38  44  49  24  15  60
4  74  56   7  34  13  17  68  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given that each agent gets an integer number of items. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocations given to others, based on their own valuation.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Total Value Calculation:** Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items. This helps us understand their preferences and potentially guide our allocations to ensure fairness.

2. **Item Allocation:** Allocate items iteratively based on the highest value an agent assigns to an unallocated item, while balancing the total value of items assigned to each agent.

3. **Check Fairness:** Ensure that each agent feels they have a fair share in comparison to others.

Let's start with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** values items as follows: [63, 11, 39, 86, 48, 8, 13, 16]. They highly value items 3 and 0.
- **Agent 1** values items as follows: [49, 10, 18, 1, 66, 99, 69, 23]. They highly value items 5 and 6.
- **Agent 2** values items as follows: [19, 0, 78, 87, 35, 19, 81, 94]. They highly value items 7 and 3.
- **Agent 3** values items as follows: [25, 85, 38, 44, 49, 24, 15, 60]. They highly value item 1.
- **Agent 4** values items as follows: [74, 56, 7, 34, 13, 17, 68, 59]. They highly value item 0.

Given these valuations, an allocation that attempts to be fair is:

- **Agent 0:** [3] (value = 86)
- **Agent 1:** [5] (value = 99)
- **Agent 2:** [7] (value = 94)
- **Agent 3:** [1] (value = 85)
- **Agent 4:** [0, 6, 4, 2] (value = 74 + 68 + 13 + 7 = 162)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one highly valued item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 6, 4, 2]
}
```
