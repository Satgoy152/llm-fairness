Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  12  32  98   1  43  88  51
1   2  80  13  68  94  60  30  48
2  57  66  36  65  71  55  22  89
3  46  26  15  33  21  40  21  34
4   6  90  94  50  48  23  96  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent given their valuation. Hereâ€™s how we can approach this problem:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - We have 5 agents and 8 items.
   - The total number of items is not divisible by the number of agents, so some agents will have more items than others.

2. **Strategy**:
   - First, identify items with high valuations for each agent to ensure that they receive items they value highly.
   - Try to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

3. **Step-by-Step Allocation**:
   - Assign items one by one to agents, prioritizing those with the highest value for each agent, while keeping track of the total number of items assigned.

4. **Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (98) and item 6 (88), so assign these two items to agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (94) and item 1 (80), so assign these two items to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (89) and item 0 (57), so assign these two items to agent 2.
   - Agent 3 has generally lower valuations, but item 5 (40) is relatively the highest among the remaining items, so assign item 5 to agent 3.
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (94), assign this remaining item to agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, minimizing envy among them.

5. **Final Allocation in JSON format**:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [7, 0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items, ensuring each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
