Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  87  24  67  43  97  73  29
1  39  69  75  67  69  52  96   0
2  96   3  39  96   0  94   6  18
3  36  94  22  86  97  49  20  76
4  30  52  86  14   4  98  43  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. A common approach is to use a round-robin method or a similar iterative selection process where each agent picks their most preferred item among the remaining ones, trying to ensure that each agent ends up with a roughly equivalent total valuation.

To achieve this, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent would have if they received all items. This helps us understand the relative valuation each agent has over the set of items.

2. Allocate items iteratively by allowing each agent to pick the item with the highest valuation to them from the remaining items.

3. Continue this process until all items are allocated, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item (if possible) and that the allocation tries to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 5 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 6 (96).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 0 (96).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 4 (97).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 5 (98), but it's already taken. Next is 2 (86).

Now, each agent has one item. We continue allocating the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0**: Remaining highest value item is 1 (87).
7. **Agent 1**: Remaining highest value item is 3 (67).
8. **Agent 2**: Remaining highest value item is 3 (96), but it's taken. Next is 5 (94), but it's also taken. Next is 6 (6).
9. **Agent 3**: Remaining highest value item is 1 (94), but it's taken. Next is 3 (86), but it's taken. Next is 7 (76).
10. **Agent 4**: Remaining highest value item is 7 (92).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocations are made based on the highest remaining valuations for each agent, trying to maintain fairness and minimize envy.
