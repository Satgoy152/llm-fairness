Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  76  97   2  62  35  34  54
1  26  74  97  73  39  31  40   9
2   4  30  14  51  94  90  99   7
3   9  11  70  19  50  42  12   2
4  52  33  65  45  83  75  59  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations provided, let's aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while maintaining fairness.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocating item 2 to agent 0, as it has the highest value (97) for them.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocating item 1 to agent 1, as it has a high value (74) for them.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocating items 6 and 4 to agent 2, as they have high values (99 and 94 respectively) for them.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocating items 5 and 3 to agent 3, as they have reasonable values (42 and 19 respectively) for them.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocating items 0 and 7 to agent 4, as these items have decent values (52 and 52 respectively) for them.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent has items that they value relatively highly, satisfying a form of fair division aligned with envy-freeness as much as possible.
