Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66   0  30  82  52  42  91  47
1  15  56  75  47  71  94  14  20
2  33  11  98  25  78  67  53  46
3  52  10   7  35  37  25  61  10
4  21  85  30  86  33  30  66  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method like the Envy-Free allocation or the Knaster procedure. However, given the constraints of the problem and the fact that we have to allocate all items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent's allocation is as close to their preferences as possible.

Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Allocation by Highest Valuation**: Start by allocating each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Adjust for Fairness**: Ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation by adjusting the allocation if any agent receives significantly more than their proportional share.

Let's move forward with the allocation:

1. **Item Allocation**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (66).
   - Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most (85).
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (98).
   - Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most (86).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (71).
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (94).
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (91).
   - Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most (52).

2. **Fairness Check**: We need to ensure that no agent has received too many items or too few. If necessary, adjust allocations to ensure fairness across all agents.

3. **Revised Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
   - Agent 1: Items [4, 5]
   - Agent 2: Items [2]
   - Agent 3: Items []
   - Agent 4: Items [1, 3, 7]

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation takes into account the preferences of each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.
