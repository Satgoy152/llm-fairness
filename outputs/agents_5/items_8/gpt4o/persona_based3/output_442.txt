Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  49  18  65  21  57  53  11
1  71   8  13  19  39  87  63  68
2  68  63  90  49  47  60   8  20
3   0  84  55  36  51   6  68  71
4  95  17  40  12  14  22  82  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair portion of value based on their own preferences.

Given the valuations, a good approach is to first identify which items are most highly valued by each agent and allocate those items to them, while ensuring that the total allocation remains fair and balanced. We will aim for a distribution that minimizes envy among the agents.

Here's one possible allocation of items to agents considering the table of valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (65), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (87), so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (90), so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (84), so we allocate item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (95), so we allocate item 0 to agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 4, 6, and 7 fairly:

- Agent 0 can receive item 6, which they value at 53.
- Agent 1 can receive item 7, which they value at 68.
- Agent 3 can receive item 4, which they value at 51.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, potentially minimizing envy and providing a fair division based on their individual valuations.
