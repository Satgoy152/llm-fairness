Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  10  57  27  54  72  56  21
1  15  42  80  90  33  71  23  89
2  18  14  40  25  27   6  27  18
3  59  47  79  18  68  91  73  38
4  12  13  81  12  71  98  94  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents in a manner that minimizes envy, we can use the envy-free criterion. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, let's consider a potential allocation strategy:

1. Determine the total value for each agent by summing their valuations for all items. This will give us an idea of each agent's overall preference strength.

2. Allocate items sequentially to agents, ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation by prioritizing higher valued items for each agent. This can be done by iteratively assigning the highest valued available item to the agent who values it most, while checking for potential envy.

Let's calculate allocations based on the provided valuations:

### Total Valuations for Each Agent
- Agent 0: 11 + 10 + 57 + 27 + 54 + 72 + 56 + 21 = 308
- Agent 1: 15 + 42 + 80 + 90 + 33 + 71 + 23 + 89 = 443
- Agent 2: 18 + 14 + 40 + 25 + 27 + 6 + 27 + 18 = 175
- Agent 3: 59 + 47 + 79 + 18 + 68 + 91 + 73 + 38 = 473
- Agent 4: 12 + 13 + 81 + 12 + 71 + 98 + 94 + 42 = 433

Now, let's allocate items in a way that tries to minimize envy:

### Item Allocation

1. **Agent 3**: Highest total valuation, prioritize high-value items:
   - Item 5 (Value 91)
   - Item 6 (Value 73)

2. **Agent 4**: Second highest total valuation:
   - Item 4 (Value 71)
   - Item 7 (Value 42)

3. **Agent 1**: Third highest total valuation:
   - Item 3 (Value 90)
   - Item 2 (Value 80)

4. **Agent 0**: Fourth highest total valuation:
   - Item 0 (Value 11)

5. **Agent 2**: Lowest total valuation:
   - Item 1 (Value 14)

### Final Allocation

This allocation aims to distribute items such that each agent receives items they highly value based on the given constraints, and minimizes potential envy by allocating according to total preference strengths.

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
