Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  34  68  63  87  60  82  77
1  92  38  29   9  22  87  18  80
2  15  84  38  79   0  70   4  47
3  71  94  13  74  45  39  56  88
4  58  20  59   8  37  58  40  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, I'll use a method that tries to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their personal valuation. One such approach is the "Envy-Free up to One Good" (EF1) criterion, which aims to allocate items so that any envy an agent might feel can be removed by removing at most one item from another agent's allocation.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (87), give them item 4. Also, item 6 with a value of 82 is the second-highest value for them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1's highest valued item is 0 (92), so allocate item 0 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (84), so give them item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 the highest, but it's already allocated to Agent 2. The next highest valued item for Agent 3 is item 7 (88), so give them item 7.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4's highest valued item is item 7, but it's already allocated to Agent 3. The next highest valued item for Agent 4 is item 2 (59), so give them item 2.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (3 and 5):

6. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 at 63, which is higher than any other agent except Agent 2, who values it at 79. However, Agent 2 already has an item (1) with high value. Thus, allocate item 3 to Agent 2 for overall balance.
7. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values item 5 at 87, which is their third-highest rated item after already acquiring item 0. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item they value highly, while maintaining fairness to a reasonable extent given the constraints.
