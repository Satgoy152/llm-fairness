Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  41  98  56  93  51  48  83
1  62  13  59  93  69  88  17  68
2  94  19   0   2  81   2  14  14
3  88  21  85  96  91  27  19  42
4  35  15  27   5  23  28  87  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness as closely as possible, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their perceived value while minimizing envy towards other agents.

Let's first analyze the given data:

```
Agent 0: [72, 41, 98, 56, 93, 51, 48, 83]
Agent 1: [62, 13, 59, 93, 69, 88, 17, 68]
Agent 2: [94, 19,  0,  2, 81,  2, 14, 14]
Agent 3: [88, 21, 85, 96, 91, 27, 19, 42]
Agent 4: [35, 15, 27,  5, 23, 28, 87, 86]
```

We will use an iterative approach to allocate items to agents by selecting items that maximize the agent's value, ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal share of their total valuation.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for items are 2 (98) and 4 (93). Assign item 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for items are 3 (93) and 5 (88). Assign item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for items are 0 (94) and 4 (81). Assign item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for items are 3 (96) and 4 (91). Item 3 is taken. Assign item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for items are 6 (87) and 7 (86). Assign item 6.

After the first round of allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [6]

Remaining items: 1, 5, 7

6. **Agent 0**: Next highest value for items are 7 (83) and 1 (41). Assign item 7.
7. **Agent 1**: Next highest value for items are 5 (88) and 7 (68). Item 7 is taken. Assign item 5.
8. **Agent 2**: Only item 1 remains. Assign item 1.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 7]
- Agent 1: [3, 5]
- Agent 2: [0, 1]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [6]

### JSON Allocation Format

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's valuation of their allocated items while distributing the total number of items evenly.
