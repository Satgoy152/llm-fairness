Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  18  59  37  29   2   0  76
1   9   1  87  38  14  93  94  40
2  83  63  85   0   7  18  52  41
3  78  44  43  71  55  22  90  54
4  94  85  16  96  15  41   3  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while considering envy-freeness and ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method like the Envy-Free Sequential Allocation or Divide and Choose. However, given the specific valuations, we'll focus on maximizing the happiness of each agent while ensuring no one envies another's allocation.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Determine the Highest Value Each Agent Places on Items:**

   - Agent 0's highest value items: 7 (76), 2 (59)
   - Agent 1's highest value items: 6 (94), 5 (93), 2 (87)
   - Agent 2's highest value items: 2 (85), 0 (83), 1 (63)
   - Agent 3's highest value items: 6 (90), 0 (78), 3 (71)
   - Agent 4's highest value items: 0 (94), 3 (96), 1 (85)

2. **Greedy Allocation Based on Maximum Valuation:**

   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4 (96) - Agent 4 highly values item 3.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 4 (94) - Agent 4 values item 0 next.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (94) - Agent 1 highly values item 6.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (93) - Agent 1 values item 5 next.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (85) - Agent 2 highly values item 2.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4 (85) - Agent 4 values item 1 next.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (76) - Agent 0 highly values item 7.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (55) - Agent 3 places the highest remaining value on item 4.

3. **Verify Allocation Completeness:**

   - All 8 items are allocated.
   - Every agent receives an integer number of items.
   - No more items left to allocate.

4. **Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's happiness based on their highest valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
