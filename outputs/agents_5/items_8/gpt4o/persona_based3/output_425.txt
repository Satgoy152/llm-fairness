Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  52  93  53  83   4   3  21
1  38  54  75  59  59  84  68  68
2  24  42  98  52  52  25  75  93
3  67  35  64   7   3   5  82  73
4  87   0   1  18  47   3  18  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocated bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle. Given the complexities of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we will make an attempt to minimize envy by considering each agent's preferences.

To achieve this, we need to:
1. Sort each agent's valuations to determine which items they value the most.
2. Allocate items iteratively, seeking to maximize each agent's total valuation while minimizing envy.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the highest (93), followed by item 4 (83).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 5 the highest (84), followed by item 2 (75).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 7 the highest (93), followed by item 2 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 the highest (82), followed by item 7 (73).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 the highest (87), followed by item 4 (47).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 2 (93)
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (84)
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 7 (93)
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 6 (82)
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 0 (87)

For the remaining items, we distribute based on maximizing remaining valuations and ensuring everyone gets something if possible:

- **Agent 0**: Add item 4 (83)
- **Agent 1**: Add item 1 (54)
- **Agent 2**: Add item 3 (52)
- **Agent 3**: Add item 7 (73) was already assigned, so no additional item.
- **Agent 4**: Already has two items; prioritize others.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation while considering their preferences.
