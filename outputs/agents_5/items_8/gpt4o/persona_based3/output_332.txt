Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  15  61   1  56  61  33  62
1  92  10  48  12   6  70  66  26
2  97  63  23  95  82   9  78  12
3  34  19  46  68  78  15  92  46
4   5  79   4  18  49  24  73  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations. While achieving complete envy-freeness might not be possible with integer allocations, we can strive to minimize envy by considering the agents' valuations.

First, let's manually inspect the given valuations to strategically allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 2, 5, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value items are 0, 5, and 6.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 0, 3, and 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value items are 4, 6, and 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value items are 1, 6, and 7.

We aim to distribute the items such that the agents receive items they value highly, while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2 (value 61), Item 5 (value 61)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 92)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (value 95)
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (value 78), Item 6 (value 92)
- **Agent 4**: Item 1 (value 79), Item 7 (value 50)

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item they value highly, while distributing items as fairly as possible. Let's ensure that every item is allocated exactly once and sum to 8 items in total:

- Total items allocated: 2 (Agent 0) + 1 (Agent 1) + 1 (Agent 2) + 2 (Agent 3) + 2 (Agent 4) = 8 items

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent some of their highest-valued items and ensures all items are allocated.
