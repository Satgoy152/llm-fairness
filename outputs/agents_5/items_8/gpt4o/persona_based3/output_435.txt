Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  37  31  21  21  19  59  61
1  28  46   7  14   1  18  34  38
2  97  59  22  27  93  19  45  66
3  38  29  83  77   1  76  82  55
4  93  43  58  64  52  86  47  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents in a way that is as fair as possible, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own allocation, given their valuations.

Given the valuations matrix, we can start by trying to allocate the items such that each agent receives at least one item they value highly compared to others. We also want to ensure that the overall allocation is as balanced as possible in terms of total value received by each agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (61).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (46).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (97).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (83).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest (86).

We can start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item:

- Assign item 7 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We still need to allocate the remaining 3 items (3, 4, and 6).

Next, we'll consider the remaining items:

- Agent 0 values item 6 highly (59).
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly (93).
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly (77).

Let's assign these items:

- Assign item 6 to agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to agent 3.

With this allocation, all 8 items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value highly. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value, with attempts made to balance the total value each agent receives.
