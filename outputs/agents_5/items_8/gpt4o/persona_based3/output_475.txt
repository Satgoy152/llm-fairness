Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  61  44  90  25  68  17  62
1  21  84  78  96  61  49  61  91
2  76  18  68  64  15  52  32   9
3  97  97  78  74  43  46  28  61
4   8  32  25  22  29  40   4  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [21 84 78 96 61 49 61 91]

 [ 8 32 25 22 29 40  4 87]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or as close to it as possible given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own allocation, based on their valuations.

Let's first evaluate the total valuation for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: \(47 + 61 + 44 + 90 + 25 + 68 + 17 + 62 = 414\)
- Agent 1: \(21 + 84 + 78 + 96 + 61 + 49 + 61 + 91 = 541\)
- Agent 2: \(76 + 18 + 68 + 64 + 15 + 52 + 32 + 9 = 334\)
- Agent 3: \(97 + 97 + 78 + 74 + 43 + 46 + 28 + 61 = 524\)
- Agent 4: \(8 + 32 + 25 + 22 + 29 + 40 + 4 + 87 = 247\)

Given the valuations, we aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's valuation and minimize envy. We will allocate items by prioritizing each agent's highest valued items.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 3**: Highest total valuation. Allocate their top two valued items: item 0 (97) and item 1 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: Second highest total valuation. Allocate their top two valued items: item 3 (96) and item 7 (91).
3. **Agent 0**: Allocate their highest valued item: item 3 (90). Given it is already taken, we skip to next highest value: item 5 (68) and item 7 (62).
4. **Agent 2**: Allocate their two highest valued items: item 0 (76) and item 2 (68).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate their highest valued item: item 7 (87), but it is already taken. We allocate next highest available: item 5 (40).

### Final Allocations:

After reviewing potential overlaps and adjusting to ensure each item is only allocated once, the following distribution balances out the allocations:

- Agent 0: [5, 6]
- Agent 1: [3, 7]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]
- Agent 3: [1, 4]
- Agent 4: []

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": []
}
```
