Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  32  11  94  18  42  63  37
1  80   3  54  22  83  99  32  95
2  70  73  96  10  35  49  18   2
3  66  10  28  93  44  50  24   4
4  13  25  66  56  54  63  54  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We will try to balance the allocations based on individual valuations to minimize envy.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Each agent has different valuations for the items. We need to ensure that agents are satisfied with their allocations compared to what others receive.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - We will start by assigning the item to the agent who values it most. This can be a naive approach, but it often helps in reducing overall envy.
   - We will then adjust allocations to ensure the distribution is as balanced as possible, given the constraints.

3. **Allocation Process**:
   - Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (80), so assign to agent 1.
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (73), so assign to agent 2.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (96), so assign to agent 2.
   - Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (94), so assign to agent 0.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (83), so assign to agent 1.
   - Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (99), so assign to agent 1.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (63), so assign to agent 0.
   - Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most (71), so assign to agent 4.

4. **Resulting Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items 3, 6
   - Agent 1: Items 0, 4, 5
   - Agent 2: Items 1, 2
   - Agent 3: No items
   - Agent 4: Item 7

This allocation respects the initial strategy while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Final JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4, 5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7]
}
```
