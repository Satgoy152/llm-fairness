Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  80  24  96  86  76  27  68
1  43  25  62  98  38   9  73   1
2  59  57   2  41   3  82  25  98
3  57  62  66  15   8  60  13  79
4  91  64  75  18  39  82  65  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to achieve envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, according to their valuations.

First, let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [28, 80, 24, 96, 86, 76, 27, 68]
Agent 1: [43, 25, 62, 98, 38, 9, 73, 1]
Agent 2: [59, 57, 2, 41, 3, 82, 25, 98]
Agent 3: [57, 62, 66, 15, 8, 60, 13, 79]
Agent 4: [91, 64, 75, 18, 39, 82, 65, 42]
```

We will use a simple round-robin allocation method where each agent picks their most valued item from the remaining items, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.

1. Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 96).
2. Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 98). Since item 3 is already taken, they pick item 6 (value 73).
3. Agent 2 picks item 7 (value 98).
4. Agent 3 picks item 2 (value 66).
5. Agent 4 picks item 0 (value 91).
6. Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 86). 
7. Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 62). Since item 2 is already taken, they pick item 0 (value 43).
8. Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 82).

Now, each agent has items, and a total of 8 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: [6, 0]
- Agent 2: [7, 5]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [0]

However, we see that Agent 4 was not allocated a second item. Let's adjust to ensure each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [7, 5]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [1]

Thus, the allocations become:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This ensures each agent has at least one item and no more than 8 items are allocated overall.
