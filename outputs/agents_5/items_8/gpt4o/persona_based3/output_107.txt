Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  55  25  86  55  95  96  26
1  95   0  90  62  58  68  19  25
2  58   0  35   3  64  72  94  99
3  79  35  88  77  48  96  68  48
4  79  57  31   0  23  97  84  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, taking into account the agents' valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share of the items.

Here is a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Preferences**: 
   - Each agent's preference for an item is based on their valuation. Higher values indicate a stronger preference.

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Allocate items to agents who have the highest valuation for those items. This initial allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each item to the agent that values it the most. 

3. **Adjust for Fairness**:
   - If some agents end up with more items than others, and others with none, we may need to adjust the allocations to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

4. **Check Envy**:
   - Ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation. If envy exists, try swapping items between agents to reduce it.

Let's go through the items and allocate them based on the highest valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 95.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 55.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 90.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 64.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most at 97.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most at 99.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust if needed:

- Agent 0: Initially has items [1, 3, 6].
- Agent 1: Initially has items [0, 2].
- Agent 2: Initially has items [4, 7].
- Agent 3: Has no items, so we need to adjust.
- Agent 4: Initially has item [5].

To adjust, we'll make sure Agent 3 has at least one item:

- Let's move item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 3 (as Agent 0 has multiple items).

Now, we finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [1]
- Agent 4: Items [5]

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and aims to minimize envy based on the given valuations.
