Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  22  66  17  19  11  12  86
1  51  14  19   2   9  36  89  31
2  25  42  67  15  65   1  86  43
3  32  53  99  34   0  73  30  80
4   1  34  61  19  12  77  69  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation and reduce envy among agents, we can use methods like the "round-robin" approach or other fair division algorithm strategies. Given this problem, let's try to distribute the items so that the envy among agents is minimized as much as possible.

Let's examine the valuation table and proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 2 (both valued at 66).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 6 (valued at 89).
   - Agent 2 values item 6 highly as well (valued at 86).
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the most (valued at 99).
   - Agent 4 values item 5 highly (valued at 77).

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - We'll start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent, aiming to reduce envy:
     - Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (99 value).
     - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (89 value).
     - Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (77 value).
     - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (66 value).
     - Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (43 value).

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items 1, 3, and 4 are still available. We need to assign these to ensure each agent has at least one item and to balance the overall valuation.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (53 value) since Agent 3 has the highest valuation for it among remaining agents.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (17 value) as it has the highest remaining value for Agent 0 compared to other available items.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (65 value) as it maximizes Agent 2's total value.

Now, each agent has received at least one item, and all items have been allocated.

4. **Final Allocation in JSON Format:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation strategy attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent their most valued item (or one of their highest valued items) and ensuring all items are allocated.
