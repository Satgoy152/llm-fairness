Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  83  90  76  75  94  62  62
1  69  14  94  64  81  38  67  96
2  50  71  52  47  47  49  97  40
3  57  78  19  66  55   1  53  52
4  82  85  19  97  43  80  58  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent receives at least one item and the allocation is envy-free (or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints), we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that the total allocation respects the requirement of distributing exactly 8 items.

Let's consider the valuations and aim to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly, while minimizing envy among agents.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 the most. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 7 the most. Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 the most. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 the most. Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate 3 more items to ensure all items are distributed.

6. **Agent 0** values item 2 the second most, and it is still available. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 4** values item 0 the second most, and it is still available. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
8. **Agent 3** values item 4 the second most among the remaining items. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and it respects the total of 8 items distributed among the agents. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [3, 0]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving agents the items they value the most among those still available while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.
