Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  59  71  95   4   2  34  37
1  65  87  17  55  13  59  31  27
2   7  69  40  79  63  66   4  97
3  96  46  82  90  34  73  80  28
4  57  19  96  78  62   1  85  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and aim to achieve a distribution where no agent envies another. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as valuable as anyone else's allocation based on their own valuation.

We'll use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we'll use an iterative approach to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations that have not yet been allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 (95), 2 (71), and 1 (59).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuations for items 1 (87) and 0 (65).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 7 (97).
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0 (96) and 3 (90).
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 2 (96).

Following this rough plan, we try to allocate items so that the agents receive items they value highly, without conflicts:

1. **Agent 0** could get items: 3, which they value very highly.
2. **Agent 1** could get items: 1, which they value very highly.
3. **Agent 2** could get item: 7, which they value very highly.
4. **Agent 3** could get items: 0, which they value very highly.
5. **Agent 4** could get items: 2, which they value very highly.

Now, let's fill in the gaps by considering remaining items and their valuations:

- Remaining items are 4, 5, and 6.
- **Agent 0**'s next highest remaining is item 6 (34).
- **Agent 1**'s next highest remaining is item 5 (59).
- **Agent 4**'s next highest remaining is item 4 (62).

This allocation respects the agents' preferences as much as possible given the constraint of integer allocations.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and all items are distributed.
