Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95   7  58  88  46  64  78  54
1  95  81  63  83  42  40   4  17
2  16   0  98  36  70  39  84  96
3  43  11  50  75  83  71  28  11
4  10  26   9  86  36   4  39  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to take into account the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure that no agent perceives another agent's allocation as more desirable than their own.

One approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "round-robin" allocation or the "maximum envy-free" approach. Here, I'll try to achieve a fair allocation by examining the valuations and attempting to distribute items so that each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (95)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (95) - already taken, next highest is Item 1 (81)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (98)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (83)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (86)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 4

6. Now, distribute remaining items [5, 6, 7]:

   - **Agent 0:** Item 5 (64)
   - **Agent 2:** Item 6 (84)
   - **Agent 4:** Item 7 (89)

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to satisfy the preferences of the agents as much as possible given the constraints, and each agent has at least one item.
