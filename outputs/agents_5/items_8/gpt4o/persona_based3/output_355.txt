Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  16  72  72  45  55  37  94
1  96   4   2  58  20  82  13  57
2  44  53   7  40  66  51  82  47
3  65  37  45  12   6  11  78  86
4   6  89  55  54  62   6  43  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free and fair allocation, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and distribute them in a way that minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation is a distribution where each agent feels they have received a set of items at least as valuable as any other agent's set, according to their own valuation.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate total valuation for each item across all agents:**
   - Item 0: 213
   - Item 1: 199
   - Item 2: 181
   - Item 3: 236
   - Item 4: 199
   - Item 5: 205
   - Item 6: 253
   - Item 7: 369

2. **Rank items for each agent based on their valuations:**

   - **Agent 0:** [7, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6, 1, 0]
   - **Agent 1:** [0, 5, 3, 7, 4, 1, 6, 2]
   - **Agent 2:** [6, 4, 1, 5, 0, 7, 3, 2]
   - **Agent 3:** [7, 6, 0, 2, 1, 3, 5, 4]
   - **Agent 4:** [1, 7, 4, 2, 3, 6, 0, 5]

3. **Allocate items to agents:**
   - We want to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also considering fairness across agents.
   
   - Assign each agent an item they value the most if possible, then proceed to the next preferred item.

4. **Final allocation:**
   - **Agent 0:** Since Agent 0 values item 7 the most, allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
   - **Agent 1:** Allocate item 0, which is highly valued by Agent 1.
   - **Agent 2:** Allocate item 6, which is the most valued by Agent 2.
   - **Agent 3:** Allocate item 3, which is a highly valued item for Agent 3.
   - **Agent 4:** Allocate item 1, which is the most valued item by Agent 4.

5. **Remaining items to allocate:** Items 2, 4, and 5.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3 as it is highly valued by them.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2 as the next best choice for them.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 as the next best choice for them.

After careful consideration of each agent's preferences and valuations, the final allocation that ensures fairness and minimizes envy is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
