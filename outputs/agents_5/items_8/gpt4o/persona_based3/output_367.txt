Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  40  43  32  47  93  12   8
1  30  41  31  86  50   9   6  27
2  59   5  18  30  23  62  92  64
3  79  32  17  55  71  62  85  40
4  26  56  63  15  38   8  16  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we can use an approach that takes into consideration the valuations provided by each agent for each item. One method is to allocate items to agents in such a way that attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation.

Here is one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is for items 0 and 5. Assigning item 0 to Agent 0 gives them a high valued item.
   
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 3. Assigning item 3 to Agent 1 gives them a significant value.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 6. Assigning item 6 to Agent 2 satisfies their high valuation.

4. **Agent 3**: For Agent 3, item 4 is highly valued. Assigning item 4 to Agent 3 is a good choice.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 highly values item 2. Assigning item 2 to Agent 4 provides them a significant value.

After allocating these items, we have the following items left: 1, 5, 7. We can distribute these items to balance the allocation further:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 to increase their total value.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 to increase their total value.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 to increase their total value.

This allocation attempts to balance the values received by each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives some items.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to meet the condition of envy-freeness where possible.
