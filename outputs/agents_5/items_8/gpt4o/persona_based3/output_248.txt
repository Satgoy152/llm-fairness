Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  94  58  33  23  27  30  78
1  93  88  68  32   3  46  76  40
2  75  38  98  11  96  67  23  12
3  29  73  34  86  37  82  39   6
4  28  70  71  94  21   3   1  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they received the best possible allocation according to their own valuations. Given the valuation matrix, a possible solution can be found by attempting to maximize the minimum satisfaction level of any agent. 

One approach is to use a round-robin or sequential allocation method based on each agent's highest preference, which can help in achieving a fair distribution. However, given the complexity of the problem, it might not be possible to ensure complete envy-freeness with the provided valuations. Instead, we aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible.

Let's attempt an allocation:

1. Assign items based on each agent's highest value first to ensure that each agent gets at least one highly valued item.
2. Reassign any leftover items to balance the total value each agent receives.

We will proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1 (value 94).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (value 93).
- Agent 2 highly values item 2 (value 98).
- Agent 3 highly values item 3 (value 86).
- Agent 4 highly values item 3, but since it's already assigned, we assign item 4 (value 21), which is the next highest unassigned item for agent 4.

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 5, 6, 7.
- Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 82).
- Assign item 6 to agent 1 (value 76).
- Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value 78).

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: items 1, 7
- Agent 1: items 0, 6
- Agent 2: item 2
- Agent 3: items 3, 5
- Agent 4: item 4

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide a fair distribution based on the agents' preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
