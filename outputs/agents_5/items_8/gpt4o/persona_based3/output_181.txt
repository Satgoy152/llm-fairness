Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  56   7  83   5  41  44  15
1  73  80  72  74  12  87  71  58
2  49  54  56  68  88  92   7  16
3  39  19  37   1  61  28  25  86
4  60  37  80  88  48  74  50  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, one approach is to use the "adjusted winner" procedure or similar techniques, but for simplicity, we can use a heuristic that aims to balance total valuation among agents.

Let's calculate a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations.
2. Ensure each agent has at least one item, if possible.
3. Check for potential envy situations and adjust if necessary.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0:
  - Highest value for item 3 (83)
  - Next highest values: item 0 (80)
  
- Agent 1:
  - Highest value for item 5 (87)
  - Next highest values: item 1 (80)

- Agent 2:
  - Highest value for item 5, but it's already taken, so next: item 6 (92)
  
- Agent 3:
  - Highest value for item 7 (86)
  
- Agent 4:
  - Highest value for item 3, but it's already taken, so next: item 2 (80)
  
After assigning these, we have:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [2]

Now, let's review and adjust if needed. However, this allocation provides each agent with a reasonable share based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items and tries to minimize envy based on the initial assignment of items that each agent values most.
