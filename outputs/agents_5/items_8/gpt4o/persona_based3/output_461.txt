Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  38  40  56  21  27  35   0
1   7  21  14  37  34  67  73  52
2   6  86  49  91  57  72   0  87
3  39  15  91  12  56   9  32  53
4  24  77  96  29  12  16  24  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To create a fair division of items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve as much envy-freeness as possible. This means assigning items such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own, given their valuations. Given the table, we need to distribute 8 items among 5 agents.

The table of valuations is:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  38  40  56  21  27  35   0
1   7  21  14  37  34  67  73  52
2   6  86  49  91  57  72   0  87
3  39  15  91  12  56   9  32  53
4  24  77  96  29  12  16  24  83
```

To achieve a fair allocation, we can apply a strategy such as the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) approach or a similar heuristic that balances the perceived values across agents. Here is a reasonable allocation derived from inspecting the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most.

Now, we need to distribute the remaining items (4, 5, 7) in a way that maintains envy-freeness:

- Agent 1 values item 7 second highest after 6.
- Agent 2 values item 5 second highest after 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 second highest after 1.

Here's the allocation based on these observations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, minimizing envy across the board.
