Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  81  29  15   6  39  92  16
1  51  95  24  23  85  15  71  57
2  21  22   1  46   7  60  13  21
3  66  52  33  98  23  93   6  35
4  54  49  67  68   2  59  83  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation, based on their own valuations.

1. **Calculate total valuations for each agent**: 

   - Agent 0: 7 + 81 + 29 + 15 + 6 + 39 + 92 + 16 = 285
   - Agent 1: 51 + 95 + 24 + 23 + 85 + 15 + 71 + 57 = 421
   - Agent 2: 21 + 22 + 1 + 46 + 7 + 60 + 13 + 21 = 191
   - Agent 3: 66 + 52 + 33 + 98 + 23 + 93 + 6 + 35 = 406
   - Agent 4: 54 + 49 + 67 + 68 + 2 + 59 + 83 + 15 = 397

2. **Allocate items based on maximizing each agentâ€™s minimum utility**: 

   We can use a greedy approach to allocate the items based on descending order of valuation by each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no agent feels envious.

   - **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 6 (92), allocate item 6.
   - **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 1 (95), allocate item 1.
   - **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 5 (60), allocate item 5.
   - **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 3 (98), allocate item 3.
   - **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 4 (68), allocate item 2.

   Now, allocate the remaining items focusing on balancing and reducing envy:

   - **Agent 4**: Second highest valuation for item 2 (67), allocate item 2.
   - **Agent 0**: Second highest valuation for item 0 (7), allocate item 0.
   - **Agent 3**: Second highest valuation for item 7 (35), allocate item 7.

3. **Final allocation**:

   After considering each agent's preferences, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempt to balance the distribution such that each agent receives items they value the most, minimizing envy and ensuring fair division.
