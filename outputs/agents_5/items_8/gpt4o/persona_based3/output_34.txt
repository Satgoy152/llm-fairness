Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  61   7   1  94  83  48  71
1  73  56  26  58  36   7  40   5
2  50  39  14  53  97  98  16   1
3  73  74  18  67  73  15  86  26
4  22  50  27  34  12  21  49  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the 8 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to ensure that the allocation is envy-free to the extent possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: Look for items that have significantly high valuations for specific agents and assign those items to those agents if possible.

2. **Balance Allocation**: Ensure each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences while attempting to minimize envy.

3. **Allocate Items**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 (94) and item 5 (83) highly. Assign these to Agent 0.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 (98) and item 4 (97) highly. Since item 5 is already allocated, give Agent 2 item 4.
   - Agent 3 values item 6 (86) highly. Assign this to Agent 3.
   - Agent 4 doesn't have any extremely high valuations, so allocate items with moderate values.
   - Check remaining items and allocate them to balance total valuations.

4. **Review and Adjust**: Ensure all items are allocated and the allocation is as fair and envy-free as possible.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

Explanation:
- **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 1, which have relatively high values for them.
- **Agent 1** gets item 2, which is one of the remaining items with a moderate value for them.
- **Agent 2** gets item 4, which is highly valued by them.
- **Agent 3** gets items 6 and 7, with item 6 being highly valued by them.
- **Agent 4** gets items 3 and 5, balancing the remaining moderate values.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets a portion according to their preferences as much as possible.
