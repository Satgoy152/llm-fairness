Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86   5  39  49  88  58  56  85
1  54  19  30  25  99  95  34  57
2  28  54  12  56  20  31  32  90
3  96  97  78  55  46  35  17   2
4   2  10  67  88  49  62  20  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the constraints of integer allocations and the need to allocate all items, we can use an approach that considers both fairness and the total valuations of items allocated to each agent.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 highly, with a value of 88. Also finds item 0 valuable with a value of 86. Allocating these two items to agent 0.
  
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the highest (99), but it's already taken. The next highest value is item 5 (95). Allocating item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Values item 7 the highest (90). Allocating item 7 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 the highest (97). Allocating item 1 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 the highest (88). Allocating item 3 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items (items 2 and 6):

- **Item 2 (67)**: The highest remaining valuation is for agent 4, so allocate item 2 to agent 4.
  
- **Item 6 (56)**: The next highest valuation is for agent 0, so allocate item 6 to agent 0.

This allocation strives to consider the most valued items for each agent while covering all items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
