Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  75  17  68  55   0  23  72
1  51  98  31   1  32  90  60  58
2  22  13  52  26  98  46  46  25
3  37  18  74  85  77   7  88  25
4  42  79  51  53  25  90  20  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to achieve an envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle.

One approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns choosing their highest-valued available item. This can sometimes lead to envy-free allocations or at least minimize envy.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 chooses item 0 (value 86).
   - Agent 1 chooses item 1 (value 98).
   - Agent 2 chooses item 4 (value 98).
   - Agent 3 chooses item 6 (value 88).
   - Agent 4 chooses item 5 (value 90).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 chooses item 7 (value 72).
   - Agent 1 chooses item 2 (value 31).
   - Agent 2 chooses item 3 (value 26).
   
With this distribution, all items have been allocated and the allocations are likely to be close to envy-free, given the preferences.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation process tries to balance the value each agent receives according to their preferences, attempting to minimize envy.
