Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  24  42  39   7  81  20  49
1  18  75  76  13   3  12  88  89
2  23  11  26  50  92   2   1  66
3  20  65  92  11  79  23  74  74
4   2  29  36  13  76  73  99  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation as much as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations, one approach is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" or "Maximum Nash Welfare" to try to balance the allocations. However, since we are working with integers and a limited number of items, we must manually inspect and adjust to achieve a fair allocation.

Let's start by observing the highest valued items for each agent, as these are likely to cause envy if not allocated carefully. Then, we will distribute the items in a way that maximizes the satisfaction while minimizing envy.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 highly (81), so we can allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values items 6 and 7 highly (88 and 89, respectively). We can allocate items 6 and 7 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 highly (92), so we can allocate item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 highly (92), so we can allocate item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 highly (99), but since it is allocated to agent 1, we will consider the next highest-valued item, item 7 (83), which is also taken. We then consider item 4 (76), which is allocated to agent 2. We go with item 1 (29) for agent 4.

Next, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 0 and item 3 remain unallocated. We need to distribute them to ensure each agent has at least one item and no agent receives more than necessary.

- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (valuation = 63).
- Assign item 3 to agent 4 (valuation = 13).

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution so that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy.
