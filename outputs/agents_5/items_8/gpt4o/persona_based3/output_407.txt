Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  18   3  75   6  65  71  78
1  36  53  33  16  66  60  83  24
2  66  85  31  39  80  96  81  54
3   9  28  13  99  79  53  59  87
4  23  73  89  80  41  42   4  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share given their preferences. One common method to achieve this is to use the maximum sum allocation strategy, where we aim to maximize the sum of the minimum valuations each agent has for their allocated items.

Let's analyze the situation and decide on an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 7 the highest (78).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the highest (83).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the highest (96).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the highest (99).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the highest (89).

By allocating the highest valued item available to each agent, we ensure each agent receives at least one item they highly value. Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Allocate item 7 to Agent 0**: They value it at 78, which is their highest valuation.
- **Allocate item 6 to Agent 1**: They value it at 83, their highest.
- **Allocate item 5 to Agent 2**: They value it at 96, their highest.
- **Allocate item 3 to Agent 3**: They value it at 99, their highest.
- **Allocate item 2 to Agent 4**: They value it at 89, their highest.

Now, we have 3 items left (0, 1, 4), and we need to allocate them:

- **Agent 0**: Add item 0 (13).
- **Agent 1**: Add item 1 (53).
- **Agent 4**: Add item 4 (41).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly while distributing the remaining items to maintain balance. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation is designed to maximize the fairness given the agents' preferences and the available items.
