Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  20  93  53  96  64  56  42
1  40  47  52  99  44  71  15  82
2  15  92  14   1  95  59  66  57
3  26  15  25   0  72  48  33  77
4  91  25  35   0  86  49   4  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring fairness and envy-freeness, we can use a method called the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" approach. This method involves agents taking turns to pick their most valued item from the remaining pool of items. Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, we will ensure each agent gets at least one item, and some agents may get more than one.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 35 + 20 + 93 + 53 + 96 + 64 + 56 + 42 = 459
- Agent 1: 40 + 47 + 52 + 99 + 44 + 71 + 15 + 82 = 450
- Agent 2: 15 + 92 + 14 + 1 + 95 + 59 + 66 + 57 = 399
- Agent 3: 26 + 15 + 25 + 0 + 72 + 48 + 33 + 77 = 296
- Agent 4: 91 + 25 + 35 + 0 + 86 + 49 + 4 + 75 = 365

We begin by allowing each agent to select their most valued item until all items are allocated.

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (96)
   - Agent 1 picks item 3 (99)
   - Agent 2 picks item 1 (92)
   - Agent 3 picks item 7 (77)
   - Agent 4 picks item 0 (91)

2. **Round 2:**
   - Remaining items: 2, 5, 6
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (93)
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (71)
   - Agent 2 picks item 6 (66)

3. **Round 3:**
   - All items are allocated.

Let's verify that each agent receives at least one item, and no more than 8 items are allocated in total. Now, we provide the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while maintaining fairness and ensuring all items are allocated.
