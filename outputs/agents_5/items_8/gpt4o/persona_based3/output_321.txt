Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  43  99  74  62  77  56  45
1  54  31  99  98  56  94   1  92
2  91  17  81   9  80   9  81   0
3  87  99  25  93  75  54  23  15
4  80  26  69  13  63  11  75   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness where each agent feels that their allocation is as good as or better than what any other agent receives. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness can be complex and may not always be possible in terms of integer allocations. Therefore, we aim for a fair division that maximizes each agent's perceived value of their allocation.

Here's a potential allocation approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:** Check each agent's highest valued items and aim to allocate those items to maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Balance Allocation:** Ensure each agent receives items that cumulatively reflect a fair distribution in terms of value.

Let's consider the valuations and derive a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (99) and also places high value on items 3 and 5.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (99) and item 3 closely (98).
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0 (91).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (99) and item 3 closely (93).
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly (80).

Considering the above preferences and aiming for a balanced allocation in terms of total value perceived by each agent, here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 as it's their highest preference and prevents overlap with Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, since it is their second highest preference.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it is their highest preference.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3, as it is their top preference.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4, balancing the total value.

Now, distribute the remaining items to ensure each agent receives at least one item and the perceived value is relatively balanced:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3.

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences and valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible given the constraints of integer allocations.
