Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  61  16  73  93   6  61  29
1  37  15  53  72  26  49  61   0
2  27  57  36  65  91  38  19  53
3  62  47  67   3  34  84  87  62
4  59  91  37   0  28  57  51  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free division where each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuation. This is a challenging task given the constraints and the need to allocate all items.

Let's proceed with a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Start by identifying which items are most valued by each agent and try to allocate those items to them if possible, ensuring envy-freeness.
2. **Balance Allocation:** Ensure that the number of items each agent receives is roughly balanced. Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents may receive more than one item while others may receive only one.
3. **Envy-Free Check:** After an initial allocation, check if any agent would prefer another's allocation over their own. Adjust if necessary.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** has high value for item 0, so assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 significantly, so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 highly, so assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** has high value for item 6, assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4** values item 1 highly, hence assign item 1 to Agent 4.
  
With the initial high-value items allocated, distribute the remaining items:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it reasonably after item 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3, who values it more compared to other agents.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0, who has a higher valuation for it compared to others.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives items they value while balancing the number of items each agent gets, and aiming for envy-freeness given the constraints.
