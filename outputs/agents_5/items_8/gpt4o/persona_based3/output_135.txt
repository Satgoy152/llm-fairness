Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  68  38   9  25  64  54  34
1  37  71  81  75  34  20  11  33
2   8  50  26  98  30  20  11  56
3  45   7  70  68  58  28  61  63
4  36  91  26  22  54  76  70  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. Given the valuations provided, we will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Let's work through the process:

1. **Agent 0's Preferences**: 
   - Highest valuation items: 0 (86), 1 (68), 5 (64)
2. **Agent 1's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuation items: 2 (81), 3 (75), 1 (71)
3. **Agent 2's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuation items: 3 (98), 7 (56), 1 (50)
4. **Agent 3's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuation items: 2 (70), 3 (68), 7 (63)
5. **Agent 4's Preferences**:
   - Highest valuation items: 1 (91), 7 (85), 5 (76)

**Attempted Fair Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Assign items [0, 5] (86+64 = 150)
- **Agent 1**: Assign items [2, 3] (81+75 = 156)
- **Agent 2**: Assign items [6] (11)
- **Agent 3**: Assign items [4] (58)
- **Agent 4**: Assign items [1, 7] (91+85 = 176)

This allocation takes into account the highest valuation preferences of agents while ensuring an envy-free distribution as much as possible given the constraints.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```
