Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  29  70  99  24  65  92  87
1  73  46  15   8  46  98  61   0
2  32  67  32  15   7  57  64  36
3  83  98  98  27  42  43  15  79
4  13  14  35  19  73  17  39  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute them in a manner where no agent feels envious of another's allocation. This can be approached by maximizing the minimum satisfaction or by ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.

To proceed, we can use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that remains unallocated. This helps in ensuring some level of envy-freeness, though perfect envy-freeness isn't always possible.

Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 3 (99), so they pick item 3.
2. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 1 (98), so they pick item 1.
3. **Agent 0** again has a high valuation for item 0 (98), so they pick item 0.
4. **Agent 1** values item 5 (98) highly, so they pick item 5.
5. **Agent 3** values item 2 (98), so they pick item 2.
6. **Agent 0** values item 6 (92), so they pick item 6.
7. **Agent 4** values item 4 (73), so they pick item 4.
8. **Agent 4** picks item 7 (68) as their next highest valued item.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 3, 6]
- Agent 1 gets item [5]
- Agent 2 gets no items []
- Agent 3 gets items [1, 2]
- Agent 4 gets items [4, 7]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
