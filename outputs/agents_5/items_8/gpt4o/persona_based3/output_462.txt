Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  45  63  80  43  99   1  76
1  73  44  98  86  73  45  22  53
2  99  27  46  61  47  93  22  87
3   7   3  82  97  40  74  78  31
4  85  46   1  57  68  49  34  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider the preferences of each agent and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they would value the allocation of any other agent. 

Let's proceed by analyzing the valuations and attempting a fair distribution:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 5 the most (99), so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
   - Remaining highest value is for item 3 (80), but check other agents' preferences to ensure fairness.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values item 2 the most (98), so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values item 0 the most (99), so allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values item 3 the most (97), so allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Values item 0 the most, but it's taken. Next is item 4 (68), so allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now that each agent has been allocated one of their most preferred items, let's allocate the remaining items:

6. **Consider Remaining Items**: Items 1, 6, and 7 are left to allocate.

7. **Allocation of Remaining Items**:
   - **Item 1**: 
     - Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 at 44, Agent 2 at 27, Agent 3 at 3, and Agent 4 at 46.
     - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
   
   - **Item 6**: 
     - Agent 0 values it at 1, Agent 1 at 22, Agent 2 at 22, Agent 3 at 78, Agent 4 at 34.
     - Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 as they value it highly.
   
   - **Item 7**:
     - Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 53, Agent 2 at 87, Agent 3 at 31, and Agent 4 at 30.
     - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 as they value it highly.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the preferences of each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations.
