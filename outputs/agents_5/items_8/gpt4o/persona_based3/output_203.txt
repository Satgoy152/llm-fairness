Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  89  24   1  34  93  69  75
1   6  21  95  54  45  21  71  17
2  98  37  28  65  33  14   5  85
3  69  68  14  73  61  18  59  85
4  34  51  27  40   1  90   3  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, especially with discrete items and heterogeneous valuations, we can attempt to minimize envy through a strategic allocation strategy.

The goal is to balance the total value each agent receives, considering their preferences. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a reasonable allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: For each agent, calculate the sum of their valuations for all items to understand their total preference.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate items starting with the highest-valued items for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one high-value item according to their valuation.

3. **Balance and Adjust**: After initial allocations, adjust by swapping items between agents to minimize envy and balance total received value.

Let's apply this process:

### Step 1: Total Valuation
- Agent 0: Total Value = 427
- Agent 1: Total Value = 330
- Agent 2: Total Value = 365
- Agent 3: Total Value = 447
- Agent 4: Total Value = 336

### Step 2: Initial Allocation
- Agent 0: Allocate item 5 (value 93)
- Agent 1: Allocate item 2 (value 95)
- Agent 2: Allocate item 0 (value 98)
- Agent 3: Allocate item 7 (value 85)
- Agent 4: Allocate item 5 (value 90) - already taken, allocate item 7 (also value 90) - already taken, allocate item 1 (value 51)

### Step 3: Balance and Adjust
- After initial allocation, we have only 3 items allocated. We need to allocate 5 more items considering remaining preferences and minimizing envy.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [5, 4] - (values 93, 34)
- Agent 1: [2, 3] - (values 95, 54)
- Agent 2: [0, 6] - (values 98, 5)
- Agent 3: [7] - (value 85)
- Agent 4: [1] - (value 51)

### Final Allocation JSON:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly, considering each agent's top preferences and attempting to balance the total values received by each agent.
