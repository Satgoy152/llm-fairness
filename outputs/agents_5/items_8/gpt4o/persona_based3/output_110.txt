Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  76  36  45  75  57  78  75
1  75  61   4   0  79  29  63   1
2  17  80   1  60  56  26  78  21
3  46   5  35  39  58  84  66  58
4  47  89  37  13  64  81  87  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents in a way that considers fairness and attempts to minimize envy. A common approach for such problems is to use algorithms like the adjusted winner procedure or envy-free methods, but given the integer constraint and limited number of items, we might instead focus on achieving a balanced distribution of total perceived value.

Here's a simple approach we can use:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Compute the sum of all items' valuations for each agent.

2. **Item Allocation**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
   - Adjust to ensure each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

3. **Balancing**:
   - If needed, reallocate to ensure no agent is disproportionately favored by the allocation, based on their total valuations.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Most valued by Agent 1 (75).
2. **Item 1**: Most valued by Agent 4 (89).
3. **Item 2**: Most valued by Agent 0 (36).
4. **Item 3**: Most valued by Agent 2 (60).
5. **Item 4**: Most valued by Agent 1 (79).
6. **Item 5**: Most valued by Agent 3 (84).
7. **Item 6**: Most valued by Agent 4 (87).
8. **Item 7**: Most valued by Agent 0 (75).

Initial allocation based on highest values:
- Agent 0: [2, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [1, 6]

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: 111 (36 + 75)
- Agent 1: 154 (75 + 79)
- Agent 2: 60 (60)
- Agent 3: 84 (84)
- Agent 4: 176 (89 + 87)

All items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```
