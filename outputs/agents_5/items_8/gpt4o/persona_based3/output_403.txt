Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  24  64   4  56   7  68  12
1  41  22   7   1  95  72  90  25
2  39  70  72  13  21  35  62  33
3  52   1  89  14  15  82  11  81
4  10  28  47  40  97  36  31   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy and considers the agents' valuations, we can use the method of "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1), which is a common criteria in fair division problems. This method ensures that each agent does not feel envy towards another agent if they were to remove one item from the envied agent's bundle.

Given the valuations, let's attempt to allocate the items as fairly as possible:

1. Calculate the total value each agent perceives for all items combined.
2. Use a round-robin or a similar method to allocate items to agents, trying to keep the allocations as balanced as possible in terms of perceived value.

Let's outline one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values items: 0, 2, 4, 6 highly.
- Agent 1 values items: 4, 5, 6 highly.
- Agent 2 values items: 1, 2, 6 highly.
- Agent 3 values items: 0, 2, 5, 7 highly.
- Agent 4 values items: 4, 2, 5 highly.

Considering this, I will attempt to allocate items to balance the perceived value:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation: 95).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (highest valuation: 89).
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest valuation: 68).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (second-highest valuation: 52).
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (second-highest valuation: 36).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (highest valuation: 70).
7. Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (third-highest valuation: 81).
8. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (lowest valuation: 4).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2, 7],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items fairly based on the highest individual valuations and ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Note that such allocations may not be perfectly envy-free, but they aim to be as fair as possible given the constraints.
