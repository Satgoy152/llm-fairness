Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  44  29  46  23  92  32  18
1  17  59  91  28  26  25   2  96
2  82  70   8  43  60  41  15  61
3  58  11  68  36   1  76  24  54
4  51  20  30  95  91  63  22  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their respective valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that approaches envy-freeness and is as fair as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of another agent over their own, considering their valuations.

To simplify the process, we will use a round-robin allocation strategy. In this approach, we will allocate items in turns to the agents based on their highest valuation for the remaining items. This ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and we distribute the items as fairly as possible given their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Identify the item with the highest value for each agent.
2. Allocate items in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that each agent gets their highest valued item available in their turn.
3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Round 1:**
  - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 92).
  - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 96).
  - Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 82).
  - Agent 3 picks item 5, but it's taken, so picks item 3 (value 36).
  - Agent 4 picks item 3, but it's taken, so picks item 4 (value 91).

- **Round 2:**
  - Agent 0 picks item 0, but it's taken, so picks item 1 (value 44).
  - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 91).
  - Agent 2 picks item 1, but it's taken, so picks item 4 (value 60).
  - Agent 3 picks item 2, but it's taken, so picks item 5, but it's taken, so picks item 6 (value 24).
  - Agent 4 picks item 3, but it's taken, so picks item 5 (value 63).

After this allocation, all 8 items are distributed. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

Please note this solution efficiently distributes the items based on the agents' preferences and remains as fair as possible under the given constraints.
