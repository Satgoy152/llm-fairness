Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  15  45  43  65  78  58  48
1  97  26  24  87  77  78  54  88
2  88   5   3  61  65  69  22  53
3   9   2  68  31  62  21  79  78
4  17  26  62  23   5  16  77  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to allocate items in such a way that each agent values their own bundle at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle.

Given the valuations, we will use a method to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Let’s analyze and allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: Values Item 0 the most at 94. Let's allocate Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values Item 0 the most as well, but since it's taken, their next highest value is for Item 3 at 87. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values Item 0 the most, but it's taken. Their next highest value is for Item 5 at 69. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values Item 6 the most at 79. Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values Item 6 the most, but it’s taken. Their next highest value is for Item 2 at 62. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 1, 4, and 7. We'll allocate these to balance the distribution:

6. **Remaining Allocation**:
   - **Agent 0**: Could take Item 1, valued at 15.
   - **Agent 1**: Could take Item 7, valued at 88.
   - **Agent 2**: Could take Item 4, valued at 65.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and the total number of items allocated is 8, satisfying the condition. Now, let's put this into the specified JSON format.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation seeks to be fair by considering each agent's preferences and distributing the items accordingly.
