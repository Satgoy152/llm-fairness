Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  32  35  90  37  52  87  27
1  29  78  57  21  87   9  32   2
2  54  74   1  83   3  78  62  70
3  18  41   3  68  26  24   3  91
4  24  25  64   4  99  16  75  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we will use the concept of envy-freeness. A fair division is considered envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. With this in mind, we will attempt to allocate the items in such a way that each agent values their allocation as much as possible, while minimizing envy.

Given the valuations table, let's analyze how to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 highly (90), which is significantly higher than any other valuation. Assigning item 3 to Agent 0 could be a good starting point.

2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest (87). Assigning item 4 to Agent 1 could minimize envy for them.

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 1 (74) and 5 (78). Let's assign item 5 to Agent 2 for now.

4. **Agent 3** values item 7 the highest (91). Assigning item 7 to Agent 3 could minimize envy for them.

5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the highest, but since it is already assigned, the next highest is item 6 (75). Assign item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining unallocated items: 0, 1, 2, and 8.

- **Agent 0** can take item 0 (14) and item 2 (35) since they have moderate values for these items.
- **Agent 2** can take item 1 (74), which they also value highly.

Finally, the allocation can be made as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuation items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.
