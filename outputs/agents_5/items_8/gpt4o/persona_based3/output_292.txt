Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93  88  55  22  66   2  11  30
1  44  62  93   5  10  44  57  99
2  63  97  77  18  68  65  21  48
3   4  13  45  78  61  94  75  56
4  56  18  39  26  31   1  44  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [93, 88, 55, 22, 66, 2, 11, 30]
Agent 1: [44, 62, 93, 5, 10, 44, 57, 99]
Agent 2: [63, 97, 77, 18, 68, 65, 21, 48]
Agent 3: [4, 13, 45, 78, 61, 94, 75, 56]
Agent 4: [56, 18, 39, 26, 31, 1, 44, 22]
```

We can adopt a method to allocate items by maximizing the total valuation for each agent while keeping the distribution as balanced as possible. One approach is to assign items in a way that each agent gets their highest valued items first, and adjust to balance the number of items each agent receives.

A possible allocation strategy is as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items where Agent 0 has high valuation first. Items 0 and 1 are highly valued by Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 7 is highly valued.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 is highly valued, but it is already allocated to Agent 0, so we look for the next highest, such as item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 5 is the highest.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate items where Agent 4 has higher valuations, such as item 0, but if already allocated, choose the next highest value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1: Assign item 7.
- Agent 2: Assign item 2.
- Agent 3: Assign item 5.
- Agent 4: Assign items 3, and 4.
  
Here is the complete allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, with attention given to balancing their preferences as much as possible.
