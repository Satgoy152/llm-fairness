Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  22  65  26  18  50  60  65
1  92  55  60  44  79  62  96  69
2  99  92  20  49  76  85  40  56
3  91  93  18  19  95  94  10   1
4   3  38  78  81   2  82  88  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, ensuring each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Since each agent's valuation of items is different, we'll strategically assign items to maximize the perceived fairness.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Total Items**: There are 8 items to allocate among 5 agents.

2. **Maximum Valuation per Item**: Identify which agent values each item the most.

    - Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 99.
    - Item 1: Agent 3 values it at 93.
    - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 65.
    - Item 3: Agent 4 values it at 81.
    - Item 4: Agent 3 values it at 95.
    - Item 5: Agent 3 values it at 94.
    - Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 96.
    - Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 65.

3. **Allocate Items Based on Maximum Valuation**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring they receive their highest-valued items.

   - Item 0 to Agent 2
   - Item 1 to Agent 3
   - Item 2 to Agent 0
   - Item 3 to Agent 4
   - Item 4 to Agent 3
   - Item 5 to Agent 3
   - Item 6 to Agent 1
   - Item 7 to Agent 0

4. **Review Allocations and Adjust if Necessary**: Check if any agent gets more than two items, as we have 5 agents and 8 items. Agent 3 currently has 3 items.

5. **Reallocate for Fairness**: Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than two items.

   - This adjustment can be made by swapping items among agents to balance the allocation.

6. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Item 2, Item 7
   - Agent 1: Item 6
   - Agent 2: Item 0
   - Agent 3: Item 1, Item 5
   - Agent 4: Item 3, Item 4

By following this process, we've attempted to distribute the items in a way that reflects the highest individual valuations and maintains a sense of fairness.

Here's the JSON representation of the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
