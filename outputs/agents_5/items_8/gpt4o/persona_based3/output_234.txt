Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  30  58  43  44  99  18  90
1  20  16  76  30   2   5  80  63
2  84  32  56  71  72   5  42  40
3  87  67  64  67  67   1  21  36
4  24  68  47  11  50  23  33  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maintaining the principles of fair division and envy-freeness, we need to ensure that all items are distributed in a manner that minimizes envy and maximizes the perceived value for each agent.

Given the valuations, we'll use the method of maximizing the sum of utilities for each agent and ensuring no agent envies the allocation of another if possible. This approach considers the agents' preferences and allocates items to maximize individual satisfaction.

Here is one potential allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 5 highly, so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 6 highly, so allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 0 highly, so allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values items 1 and 3 highly, so allocate items 1 and 3 to agent 3.
- **Agent 4** values item 4 highly, so allocate item 4 to agent 4.

The remaining items are items 2 and 7. These can be allocated to minimize envy and maximize overall utility. After considering all options:

- Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 7 to agent 1.

**Final allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to maximize the perceived value for each agent while ensuring that no agent has a substantial reason to envy another's allocation.
