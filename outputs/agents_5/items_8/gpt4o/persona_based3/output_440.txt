Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  61  22  54   0  83  57  78
1  35  65  70   3  30  91  42  31
2  68  60  58  18   2  20  50  80
3  30  56   8  84   6  29  19  34
4  59   6  11  56  53   3  90  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives from their allocated items. Given that each agent values items differently, the goal is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly relative to their other possible allocations.

Let's consider the following approach for allocating items:

1. **Agent 0**: We allocate item 5 to Agent 0 because it has the highest value (83) for them. We also allocate item 0 (value 65) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: We allocate item 2 to Agent 1 as it has the highest value (70) for them. We also allocate item 5 to Agent 1 because of a high value (91), but since it's assigned to Agent 0, we skip this and allocate item 1 (value 65) instead.

3. **Agent 2**: We allocate item 7 to Agent 2 as it has the highest value (80) for them.

4. **Agent 3**: We allocate item 3 to Agent 3 as it has the highest value (84) for them.

5. **Agent 4**: We allocate item 6 to Agent 4 as it has the highest value (90) for them. We also allocate item 4 to Agent 4, as the next best option (53).

Let's summarize the allocation while ensuring each item is assigned to one agent only:

- **Agent 0**: [5, 0] - Values: 83, 65
- **Agent 1**: [2, 1] - Values: 70, 65
- **Agent 2**: [7] - Value: 80
- **Agent 3**: [3] - Value: 84
- **Agent 4**: [6, 4] - Values: 90, 53

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value most, and no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 4]
}
```
