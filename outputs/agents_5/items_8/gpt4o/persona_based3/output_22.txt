Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  43  70  44  74   5  31  13
1  37  49  76  65  78  92  60  45
2  25  86  78  12  67  28  17  41
3   5  69  83  58  32  89  16  14
4  56  63  13  75  25  25  66  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use concepts from fair division, such as maximizing the minimum utility (max-min fairness) or minimizing envy.

Let's first calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items:

- Agent 0: 52 + 43 + 70 + 44 + 74 + 5 + 31 + 13 = 332
- Agent 1: 37 + 49 + 76 + 65 + 78 + 92 + 60 + 45 = 502
- Agent 2: 25 + 86 + 78 + 12 + 67 + 28 + 17 + 41 = 354
- Agent 3: 5 + 69 + 83 + 58 + 32 + 89 + 16 + 14 = 366
- Agent 4: 56 + 63 + 13 + 75 + 25 + 25 + 66 + 70 = 393

Since there are 8 items, ideally each agent should get about 1 or 2 items. We will try to allocate items such that the sum of valuations each agent receives is as balanced as possible, while also considering each agent's individual preferences.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 4
   - Valuation: 52 (for item 0) + 74 (for item 4) = 126
- Agent 1: Items 2 and 5
   - Valuation: 76 (for item 2) + 92 (for item 5) = 168
- Agent 2: Items 1 and 6
   - Valuation: 86 (for item 1) + 17 (for item 6) = 103
- Agent 3: Item 3
   - Valuation: 58 (for item 3)
- Agent 4: Item 7
   - Valuation: 70 (for item 7)

This distribution tries to respect the preferences and total valuations as much as possible while ensuring each agent receives either one or two items, and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7]
}
```
