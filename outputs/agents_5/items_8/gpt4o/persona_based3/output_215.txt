Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  16  68   6  59  85   1  10
1  67  80  32  88  13  64  45  77
2  35  72  27  80  88  45  70  34
3  20  20  78  86  56  20  67  23
4  52  61  86  55  14  39  14  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to find an allocation that is envy-free, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent to their own. However, finding a perfect envy-free allocation may not always be possible, especially with a limited number of items and agents. We will try to find an allocation that is as envy-free as possible under the given constraints.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High Valued Items for Each Agent:** Look for the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate them to the agents who value them the most, if possible.

2. **Balance the Number of Items:** Ensure each agent receives roughly an equal number of items, given that there are 8 items and 5 agents. Ideally, some agents will receive 2 items and others 1 item.

3. **Check for Envy:** After initial allocation, check if any agent envies another's allocation. If so, attempt to swap items to reduce envy.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (85), so assign item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (88), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (88), so assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (78), so assign item 2 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most (86), but it's already taken, so assign the next highest (item 0, value 52) to agent 4.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 1 (80), but agent 1 already has one item. Assign it to agent 4, who values it second (61).
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 2 (70), assign it to agent 2.
- Item 7 is valued highest by agent 1 (77), but agent 1 already has one item. Assign it to agent 3, who values it next (23).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 4 and 6
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 7
- Agent 4: Items 0 and 1

This allocation aims to balance the number of items and distribute them according to high individual valuations. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
