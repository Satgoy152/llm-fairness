Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  54   5  64  97  99  38   3
1   1  97  35  14  29  45  97  54
2  64  49  36  16  91  45  82  29
3  65  46  39  40  29  99  13  13
4  87  79  79  35  55  74  80  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents in a fair manner, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy. One common method is the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) allocation, which ensures that no agent would envy another agent after removing at most one item from the other agent's allocation.

To achieve this, we can use an iterative approach to assign items one by one, prioritizing items that maximize the minimum increase in valuation for the agents. Here's the allocation process:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (99), so we allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (97), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Agent 4 values items 0 and 2 equally high (79), so we allocate item 0 to agent 4.
4. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (91), so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
5. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest, but it's already allocated, so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.
6. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest, but it's already allocated, so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
7. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest, but it's already allocated, so we allocate item 2 to agent 1.
8. Agent 4 values item 7 next highest (42), so we allocate item 7 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints. Note that each agent may not get their most-valued items due to the constraints of integer allocation and the need to allocate all items.

Here's the resulting allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```
