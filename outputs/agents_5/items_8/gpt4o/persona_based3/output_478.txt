Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  39  27  83  52  66  70  47
1  53  56  67  98  99  48  44  67
2  38  75  39  48  19   7  95  65
3  45   8   7  33  20  16   2   5
4  53  11  40  54  28  12  49  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can employ a strategy that aims to minimize envy by considering each agent's valuation of the items and attempting to balance the total value of items each agent receives. The goal is to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

### Step-by-step Allocation Strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Look for items with high valuations across agents and see which agent values them most. 
2. **Assign High-Valued Items First**: Start by assigning items to agents who value them the most, ensuring no agent gets more than their fair share of high-value items initially.
3. **Balance the Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items by considering the current total value of items assigned to each agent, attempting to balance these as closely as possible.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 0, 3, and 6.
- **Agent 1**: High valuations for items 3, 4, and 2.
- **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 6.
- **Agent 3**: No particularly high valuations. 
- **Agent 4**: No particularly high valuations but has the highest value for item 4 among items left.

#### Allocating Items:

1. **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 0 (highest value).
2. **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 1 (highest value).
3. **Item 6**: Assign to Agent 2 (highest value).

Given these initial allocations, we need to allocate the remaining items while trying to balance the total values:

4. **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 0 (second highest value, after Agent 2 who already has a high-value item).
5. **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 1 (highest value).
6. **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 4 (second highest value, after Agent 1 who already has multiple high-value items).
7. **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 0 (highest remaining value).
8. **Item 7**: Assign to Agent 4 (highest remaining value after Agents 0 and 2).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items as fairly as possible given the valuation constraints, with each agent receiving a set of items that maximizes their individual valuations while minimizing potential envy. Note that Agent 3 receives no items due to low valuations across the board, which aligns with the goal of minimizing envy by ensuring higher valued items are more evenly distributed among agents with higher valuations.
