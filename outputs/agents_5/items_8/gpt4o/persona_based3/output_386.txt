Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  41  54  12  21  61  76  70
1  73  73  72  87  80   9  42  45
2  32  56  30  11  64  67  49  60
3  52   8  15  57  33   1  32  56
4  63  85   1   1  25  18  98  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

 [63 85  1  1 25 18 98 77]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, meaning each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as anyone else's. One of the strategies often employed is maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. Below, I will provide a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

### Valuations Table:
```
Agent:  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0      95  41  54  12  21  61  76  70
1      73  73  72  87  80   9  42  45
2      32  56  30  11  64  67  49  60
3      52   8  15  57  33   1  32  56
4      63  85   1   1  25  18  98  77
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 6, and 7. Allocating item 0 (95).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations for items 3, 4, and 1. Allocating item 3 (87).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations for items 5 and 7. Allocating item 5 (67).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations for items 3 and 7. Allocating item 7 (56).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations for items 1, 6, and 7. Allocating item 6 (98).

After these allocations, items 1, 2, and 4 remain unallocated. To finish the allocation, we assign as follows:

- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (73) since it's their second-highest valuation after item 3.
- **Agent 4**: Item 4 (25) since item 4 has a relatively high valuation (25) compared to other unallocated items.
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (30) since it provides some positive value.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a valuable item according to their valuations and that the distribution reflects a reasonable balance to minimize envy.
