Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  14  86  42   6  39   8  73
1  36  61  47  30  31  10  89  71
2  28  38  40  48  30  20  36  26
3  57   8  92  85  60  20  17  40
4  59  37  88  79  15  10  11  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of exactly 8 items distributed. Given the agents' valuations, we can use a method that considers maximizing agents' satisfaction or minimizing dissatisfaction. 

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance these considerations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 highly (86) and item 0 (58). Allocating these high-value items to Agent 0 might maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuation for item 6 (89) and item 7 (71). Assigning these to Agent 1 could minimize their envy.
3. **Agent 2** doesn't have particularly high valuations, but to ensure fairness, we could allocate items that are relatively less valued by others but still provide some value to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 (92) and item 3 (85). However, since item 2 is already taken, we could allocate item 3 and another lower valued item to balance.
5. **Agent 4** should receive items that aren't highly valued by other agents but still offer some value to them.

Here's a proposed fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2] (high value for item 2)
- **Agent 1**: [6, 7] (high values for items 6 and 7)
- **Agent 2**: [5] (an item with moderate value)
- **Agent 3**: [3] (high value for item 3)
- **Agent 4**: [0, 1, 4] (items with moderate values)

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives items they value relatively more, given the constraint that exactly 8 items must be allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
