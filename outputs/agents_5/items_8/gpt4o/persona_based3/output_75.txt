Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  17  33  12  27  50  25  28
1  14  69  13  16  96  32  48  47
2  70  52  61  79  55  71  11   1
3  69  22  99  24  82  23  66  89
4  91  23  89  20  59  40  67  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given that each agent values items differently. We also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated.

Let's consider a bidder-optimal approach, which attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring envy-freeness. We'll go through each agent and try to assign the items according to their valuations, balancing the distribution as we proceed.

**Approach:**

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest Valuation: Item 0 (67)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest Valuation: Item 4 (96)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest Valuation: Item 3 (79)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest Valuation: Item 2 (99)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest Valuation: Item 7 (90)
   - Assign Item 7 to Agent 4.

Now, we have 3 items remaining: 1, 5, and 6. Let's allocate these based on remaining valuations and ensuring no agent is overly envious, while balancing the number of items among agents.

6. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0: Next highest valuation for Item 6 (25).
   - Assign Item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Next highest valuation for Item 5 (32).
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 4: Next highest valuation for Item 1 (23).
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 4.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. Agents receive items they value relatively highly within the constraints of the problem, aiming for an envy-free distribution as much as possible with the given valuations.
