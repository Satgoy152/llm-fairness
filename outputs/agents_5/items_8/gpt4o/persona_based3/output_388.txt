Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  19  38   1  99  58  89  90
1   6  90  15  26   9  28  80  49
2  55  21  72  98  92  33  93  51
3  22  54  68  99  20  22   5  94
4  36  54  98  45   2   0  97  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution to the extent possible, given the constraints of integer allocation. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own, based on their valuations. However, since perfect envy-freeness may not always be achievable, especially with integer allocations, we will focus on ensuring that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, attempting to minimize envy.

Let's begin by considering the total value each agent assigns to all items and aim for a distribution that comes closest to equalizing the perceived values:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 491
   - Agent 1: 303
   - Agent 2: 515
   - Agent 3: 384
   - Agent 4: 426

2. Aim to allocate items to balance these total valuations, trying to give each agent a roughly equal share of their total valuation.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 is highly interested in items 0 (97) and 4 (99).
- Agent 1 values item 1 (90) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 3 (98) and item 6 (93) highly.
- Agent 3 values item 3 (99) highly, but we'll need to balance with other allocations.
- Agent 4 has a balanced view but values item 2 (98) highly.

Based on this, we can propose the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 3: Item [7]
- Agent 4: Items [2, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, which should help in minimizing envy. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes the 8 items among the 5 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, while trying to maximize their individual satisfaction based on given valuations.
