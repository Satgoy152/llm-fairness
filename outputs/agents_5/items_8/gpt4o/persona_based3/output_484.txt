Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  56  88  96  54   7  55  24
1  66  20  24  19  76   6  70  34
2  73  93  94  30  47  17  95  72
3  13  69  76  38  65  44  71  33
4  75  87  21  26  67  26  82  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures a fair division based on the given valuations. One commonly used approach in fair division is to try and ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, while also considering overall fairness among all agents.

Here's a step-by-step approach to deriving a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their overall preferences.

2. **Initial Assignment Based on Highest Valuation**: Initially assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This helps in reducing potential envy.

3. **Adjust Based on Fairness**: Review the initial allocation to balance the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

4. **Final Adjustments**: Make adjustments to ensure all items are allocated and to balance the overall fairness.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**:
   - Agent 0: 18 + 56 + 88 + 96 + 54 + 7 + 55 + 24 = 398
   - Agent 1: 66 + 20 + 24 + 19 + 76 + 6 + 70 + 34 = 315
   - Agent 2: 73 + 93 + 94 + 30 + 47 + 17 + 95 + 72 = 521
   - Agent 3: 13 + 69 + 76 + 38 + 65 + 44 + 71 + 33 = 409
   - Agent 4: 75 + 87 + 21 + 26 + 67 + 26 + 82 + 90 = 474

2. **Initial Assignment**:
   - Item 0: Agent 4 (75)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (93)
   - Item 2: Agent 2 (94)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (96)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (76)
   - Item 5: Agent 3 (44)
   - Item 6: Agent 2 (95)
   - Item 7: Agent 4 (90)

3. **Adjust Based on Fairness**:
   - Reassign Item 5 to Agent 4 to balance the allocations.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [3]
   - Agent 1: [4]
   - Agent 2: [1, 2, 6]
   - Agent 3: []
   - Agent 4: [0, 5, 7]

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 5, 7]
}
```
