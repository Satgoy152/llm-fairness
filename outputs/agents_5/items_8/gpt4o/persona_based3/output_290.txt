Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30   8  12  75  51  67  37  68
1  11  79  10  20  13  75  21  62
2  10  54  90  15  61  64  59  99
3  79  49   5  18  64  85  36  39
4  34  65  21  69  28  21  58  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we'll aim to ensure that each agent receives items according to their valuations such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

One straightforward approach is to use a round-robin allocation based on the agents' preferences for the items, ensuring that each agent gets some valued items. Given the table of valuations, we can proceed as follows:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by identifying the highest valuation for each agent and allocate the corresponding item to that agent.
2. **Remove Allocated Items:** Once an item is allocated, it cannot be allocated again.
3. **Repeat:** Continue the process until all items have been allocated.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (75).
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (79).
- **Agent 2** values item 7 the most (99).
- **Agent 3** values item 0 the most (79).
- **Agent 4** values item 3 the most, but since it's taken, item 1 is next (65), which is also taken; item 4 is next (28).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest available valuations:

- **Agent 0** next highest available is item 5 (67).
- **Agent 1** next highest available is item 5 (75), but since it's taken, item 7 is next (62), which is also taken; item 6 is next (21).
- **Agent 2** next highest available is item 2 (90).
- **Agent 3** next highest available is item 5 (85).
- **Agent 4** next highest available is item 0 (34).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy among agents based on the given valuations.
