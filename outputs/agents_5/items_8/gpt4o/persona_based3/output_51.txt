Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  49  24  50  75  73  41  93
1  29  69  70  12  78  18  46  45
2  81  53  61  60  48  35  36  92
3  55  34  44  26  30  54  97  55
4  19  14   5  13  84   5  82  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and respects the valuations provided. One approach is to use an algorithm that seeks an envy-free allocation, which can be challenging to achieve perfectly, but we can aim to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints and valuations.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 7 (93) and item 0 (84). Allocating item 7 to Agent 0 also helps minimize potential envy for this highly valued item.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 4 (78) and item 2 (70). Allocating item 4 to Agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction while minimizing others' envy.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 0 (81) and item 7 (92). Since item 0 is also highly valued by Agent 0, allocate item 6 (36) to Agent 2 to balance allocations.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 6 (97), which has not yet been allocated. Allocating item 6 to Agent 3 maximizes their satisfaction.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent highly values item 4 (84), but since it's already allocated, we allocate item 5 (82) to maximize their satisfaction.

Revising the allocation to ensure all items are allocated:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as they have the lowest valuation for this item.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 4, which they value highly.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as a remaining item they place reasonable value on.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one item they highly value, given the constraints of the problem.
