Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  49  68  75  46   0  20  54
1  28   5  71  35  51  52  64   6
2  97  22  42  12  17  48  59  45
3  59  93  53  88  93  90  22  90
4   5  93  55   4  24   3  72   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, I will consider each agent's valuations and attempt to assign items in a manner that balances the perceived value across all agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation method:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Start by identifying items that have high valuations for specific agents and try to allocate those to the corresponding agents to maximize individual satisfaction.
2. **Balance Allocation**: Ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of their high-value items while keeping the overall distribution equitable.
3. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: Adjust allocations to minimize the likelihood of one agent envying another's allocation.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 3 highly (75), followed by item 2 (68).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 2 highly (71), followed by item 5 (52).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 0 highly (97), followed by item 6 (59).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 1 highly (93), followed by item 4 (93).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 1 highly (93), followed by item 6 (72).

Given these valuations, let's attempt an initial allocation:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 (highest value).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (highest value), but note that Agent 4 also values it highly.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (second-highest value).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (high value).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (second-highest value).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 4 (second-highest value).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (best remaining value for Agent 0).

Now, let's ensure that each agent is represented in the allocation and that the total number of items allocated is 8. Adjust allocations if needed to distribute items more equitably or to minimize envy.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: [3, 7]
- Agent 1 receives items: [2, 5]
- Agent 2 receives items: [0]
- Agent 3 receives items: [1, 4]
- Agent 4 receives items: [6]

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's valuation while keeping the total number of items allocated at 8.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [6]
}
```
