Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  93   7  47  50  36  60  90
1  69  49  98  56  94  93  37  33
2   5  33  33  92   7   2  35  86
3   0  36  44  27  47  64   1  20
4  94  12  31  51  65  59  30  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[33 93  7 47 50 36 60 90]
 [69 49 98 56 94 93 37 33]
 [ 5 33 33 92  7  2 35 86]
 [ 0 36 44 27 47 64  1 20]
 [94 12 31 51 65 59 30 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that they value highly, while aiming for envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations table, we need to consider the preferences of each agent for each item and balance these preferences across all agents.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 1 highly (93).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 highly (98).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 highly (92).
   - Agent 3 values item 5 highly (64).
   - Agent 4 values item 0 highly (94).

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:**
   - Give item 1 to Agent 0.
   - Give item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Give item 3 to Agent 2.
   - Give item 5 to Agent 3.
   - Give item 0 to Agent 4.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 4, 6, 7.
   - Consider remaining valuations and aim for envy-freeness:
     - Agent 4 also values item 7 highly (88), so give item 7 to Agent 4.
     - Agent 0 values item 6 (60) more than other agents, so give item 6 to Agent 0.
     - Item 4 can be allocated next. Agent 1 values item 4 (94) highly, so give it to Agent 1.

4. **Final Allocation Check:**
   - Ensure all items are allocated.
   - Check that allocations are as balanced as possible in terms of agents' preferences.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and aims to minimize envy by ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly.
