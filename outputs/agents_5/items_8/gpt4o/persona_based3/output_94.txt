Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  83  73  73  51  56  30   7
1  60   1  71  79   2  35   0   4
2  87   5  93  95   4  63  25  39
3  24  72   5  65  90  84  36  25
4  88  50  46  26  98  63  54  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can employ an approach that aims for envy-freeness. This means that each agent should not prefer the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle based on their valuations.

Given the valuations, we will try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their own satisfaction. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 1, 2, 3 (based on high valuations).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 3, but since it's already taken, we look for other high preferences like item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 3, 2, and 5 (but will have to settle for remaining high value items).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 4, and potentially item 1.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 4, but will have to settle for remaining high value items like 0 and 5.

With a focus on ensuring each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, a feasible allocation is:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1]
- **Agent 1**: Items [0]
- **Agent 2**: Items [2, 7]
- **Agent 3**: Items [3, 6]
- **Agent 4**: Items [4, 5]

This allocation tries to balance each agent's high-value preferences with the need to distribute the items fairly. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
