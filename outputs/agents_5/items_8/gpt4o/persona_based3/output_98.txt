Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  49  94  13  51  36  24   4
1  75  40  75  35  97  95  44  26
2   5  39  51  83  26  43  91  16
3  71  95  65  64  74  69  14  56
4  53  59  82  43   1  67  77  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the goal of minimizing envy and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can employ a simple method known as the "round-robin" method or a similar heuristic approach. This method does not guarantee perfect envy-freeness but aims to distribute the items such that the agents' preferences are respected to the greatest extent possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Rank Items by Agent Preference:** For each agent, rank the items based on their preferences.
2. **Iterative Assignment:** Rotate through the agents and assign them their highest-ranked available item until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this approach:

1. **Agent 0's preferences** (descending): 2, 4, 1, 5, 0, 6, 3, 7
2. **Agent 1's preferences** (descending): 4, 5, 0, 2, 1, 3, 6, 7
3. **Agent 2's preferences** (descending): 6, 3, 5, 2, 1, 4, 0, 7
4. **Agent 3's preferences** (descending): 1, 0, 4, 5, 2, 3, 7, 6
5. **Agent 4's preferences** (descending): 2, 5, 6, 1, 0, 3, 7, 4

Now, let's proceed with the allocation using a round-robin approach, where each agent gets an item in turn based on their preferences:

- **Round 1:**
  - Agent 0 gets item 2
  - Agent 1 gets item 4
  - Agent 2 gets item 6
  - Agent 3 gets item 1
  - Agent 4 gets item 5

- **Round 2:**
  - Agent 0 gets item 0
  - Agent 1 gets item 3
  - Agent 2 gets item 7

This allocation process results in the following distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and tries to respect the agents' preferences as much as possible under the constraints.
