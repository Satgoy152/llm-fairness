Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  35  78  66   9  27  56  21
1  65  71  90  45  10  68  15  69
2  97   0  80  71  49   1  37  45
3  30  89  58  60  98  63  99   9
4  83  22  53  54  94  52  58  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or as close as possible, given the constraints. Envy-freeness means that each agent should not prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

1. Prioritize giving each agent at least one highly valued item based on their individual preferences.
2. Balance the allocation so that no one feels significantly worse off compared to others.

Based on the table, we can observe the following preferences:
- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (78).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (90).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (97).
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (99).
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (94).

With these preferences in mind, we can make allocations that attempt to respect these preferences while ensuring all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (value 78).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 7 (value 69) and item 5 (value 68).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (value 97).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 6 (value 99) and item 1 (value 89).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 4 (value 94) and item 3 (value 54).

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one of their highly valued items and balances the total value across agents as best as possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
