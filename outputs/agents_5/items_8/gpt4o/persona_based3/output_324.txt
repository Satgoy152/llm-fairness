Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  18  26  88  94  27  83  87
1  93  92  25  88  71   3  47  56
2  68  68  52  18  55  94  10  77
3  65  54  24  22  79  46  74  90
4   5  67  32   7  34  25  36  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to find an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, we can aim for a fair and balanced distribution based on the given valuations.

Here's a proposed allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 4 and 7 as they have the highest valuation for item 4 (94) and a high valuation for item 7 (87). Assign item 4 and 7 to this agent.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 0 (93) and item 1 (92). Assign these items to this agent.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 5 (94). Assign item 5 to this agent. 

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 6 (74) and item 3 (22) reasonably well compared to others. Assign these items to this agent.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 2 (32) the highest among their valuations. Assign item 2 to this agent.

The allocation would be:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6
- Agent 4: Item 2

This allocation distributes all 8 items among the 5 agents while considering their preferences.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [2]
}
```
