Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  99  34  32  17   3  56  99
1  24  87  70  58  91   8  80   9
2   0   6  20   7   4  44  21  46
3  59  70  29  43  82  16  92  83
4  66  99  97  41  42  28  22   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of the 8 items among the 5 agents, we should aim to allocate items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. This is a challenging problem, but we can approach it by trying to maximize the minimum value each agent receives and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's evaluate the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items highly at positions 1 and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values items at positions 4 and 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the most.
4. **Agent 3**: Values items 6 and 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Values items 1 and 2 highly.

Now, let's attempt to allocate the items to maximize fairness:

- **Agent 0** should receive items [1, 7] as these are their highest-valued items.
- **Agent 1** should receive items [2, 4] as these are among their highest preferences.
- **Agent 2** should receive item [5], as it is their highest-valued item.
- **Agent 3** should receive items [6, 3], which are among their higher preferences.
- **Agent 4** should receive item [0], which is a decent value for them and the only remaining item that fits.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated. This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints.
