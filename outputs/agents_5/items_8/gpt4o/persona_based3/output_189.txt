Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  10  29  64  96  83  68  88
1  78  32  47  17  35  32   5  88
2  64  24  68   2  48  48  29  24
3  35   4  24  76  16  47  65  86
4  34   3  31  50   7  12  94   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 8 items to the 5 agents in such a way that each agent gets an integer number of items, and we aim for a fair and envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Given the valuations of each agent for the items, one approach to achieve this is to use a method like "round-robin" or "sequential allocation," where agents take turns picking the most valued item remaining, based on their preferences. However, since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will end up with more items than others.

Let's proceed with a fair allocation strategy:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 96)
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 78)
   - Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 68)
   - Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 76)
   - Agent 4 picks item 6 (value 94)

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 88)
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 32)
   - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 24)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences, with the highest-valued items being distributed first. Agents 0, 1, and 2 get two items each, while agents 3 and 4 get one item each.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
