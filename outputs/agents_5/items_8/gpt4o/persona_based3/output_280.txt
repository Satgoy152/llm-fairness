Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  80   3  36   7  14  65  60
1  95  19  23  54  85  48  24  12
2  14  28  41  43  76  95  62  82
3   6  17  51  69  40  55  66   1
4  24  91  75  74  19  26  42  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items so that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the table of valuations, we will proceed with the allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Items that have high valuations by particular agents should be prioritized for those agents.
2. **Balance Total Valuation**: Try to achieve a balance in the total valuation for each agent's allocated items.
3. **Ensure Envy-Freeness**: Ensure that no agent would prefer another agent's bundle over their own based on their individual valuations.

The table of valuations is:
- Agent 0: [3, 80, 3, 36, 7, 14, 65, 60]
- Agent 1: [95, 19, 23, 54, 85, 48, 24, 12]
- Agent 2: [14, 28, 41, 43, 76, 95, 62, 82]
- Agent 3: [6, 17, 51, 69, 40, 55, 66, 1]
- Agent 4: [24, 91, 75, 74, 19, 26, 42, 74]

Following this approach, a possible allocation is:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 6], with valuations of 80 and 65, totaling 145.
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 4], with valuations of 95 and 85, totaling 180.
- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 7], with valuations of 95 and 82, totaling 177.
- **Agent 3**: Item [3], with a valuation of 69.
- **Agent 4**: Item [2], with a valuation of 75.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that exactly 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and aims to be as envy-free as possible given the differences in valuation among agents.
