Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  93  72  74  64  77  75  44
1  14  43  99  83  67  23  96  22
2  30  44  40  89  74  10  32  68
3  38  97  82  72  60  64  77  90
4  15  21  45  79  68  31  52  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that achieves envy-freeness to the greatest extent possible, given that each agent values items differently. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

One potential approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns choosing their most-valued item from the remaining pool. This method is simple and can often lead to allocations that are fair in terms of individual valuations.

Let's proceed with a sequential allocation based on the highest individual valuations, allowing each agent to choose their most valued item in turn:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 1 selects item 2 (value 99).
   - Agent 3 selects item 1 (value 97).
   - Agent 0 selects item 5 (value 77).
   - Agent 4 selects item 4 (value 68).
   - Agent 2 selects item 3 (value 89).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 6, 7.
   - Agent 1 selects item 6 (value 96).
   - Agent 3 selects item 7 (value 90).
   - Agent 0 selects item 0 (value 32).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with consideration to their individual preferences as much as possible within the constraints.
