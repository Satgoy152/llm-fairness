Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  33  30  50  93  80  77  88
1  28   6  35  73  54  18  88  38
2  92  17  91  54   7  85  75   1
3  86  70  85  11  80   8  48  31
4  42  81  22   9  72  35  37  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation given to any other agent, according to their own valuations.

To solve this problem, we'll use a heuristic approach to allocate the items based on maximizing the agents' satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest (93).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 the highest (88).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the highest (92).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the second highest (86), but it's already taken by Agent 2. Next highest is item 2 (85).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 the highest (81).

Now, we re-evaluate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Can take item 7 (88) as their second choice.
- **Agent 1**: Can take item 3 (73) as their second choice.
- **Agent 3**: Can take item 4 (80) as their second choice, but it's already taken. Next is item 5 (8), which is not the best, but let's consider reallocating.
- **Agent 4**: Can take item 6 (37) as their second choice, but it's already taken. Next is item 5 (35).

Let's optimize further considering only available items:

- **Agent 0**: Has item 4.
- **Agent 1**: Has item 6.
- **Agent 2**: Has item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Has item 2.
- **Agent 4**: Has item 1.

Reallocate remaining items to maximize satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: Takes item 7.
- **Agent 1**: Takes item 3.
- **Agent 4**: Takes item 5 (since item 5 is valued higher than item 6 for Agent 4).

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [4, 7]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 6]
- **Agent 2**: [0]
- **Agent 3**: [2]
- **Agent 4**: [1, 5]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
