Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  39  77  19  55  11  75  41
1  50  34  95  36   7  87  83  91
2  91  54   6  46   5  46  22  41
3  67  83   3  84  28  40  38  83
4   5  78  56  28  31   5  87  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness to the extent possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle, based on their individual valuations.

Given the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  39  77  19  55  11  75  41
1  50  34  95  36   7  87  83  91
2  91  54   6  46   5  46  22  41
3  67  83   3  84  28  40  38  83
4   5  78  56  28  31   5  87  14
```

Let's start by analyzing the highest value each agent assigns to the items and attempt to allocate items based on these preferences while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the most at 77.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the most at 95. Second choice is item 7 at 91.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the most at 91.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the most at 84.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 6 the most at 87.

Starting with these observations, here is a possible allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (77). 
- **Agent 1**: Since item 2 is taken, allocate item 7 (91).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (91).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 (84).
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 6 (87).

Now, we have allocated 5 out of 8 items. We need to allocate 3 more items. We will consider the remaining items (1, 4, 5) and allocate them based on the second highest preferences to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 6 (75) - already allocated to Agent 4, so allocate item 0 (72) - already allocated to Agent 2. Next highest is item 1 (39).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5 (87) - already allocated to Agent 4. Next highest is item 6 (83) - already allocated to Agent 4, so allocate item 1 (34).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1 (83) - already allocated to Agent 4, so allocate item 4 (28).
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 5 (5).

Revising the allocations to ensure all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2] (77)
- **Agent 1**: Items [7] (91)
- **Agent 2**: Items [0] (91)
- **Agent 3**: Items [3] (84), [5] (40)
- **Agent 4**: Items [6] (87), [4] (31), [1] (78)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [6, 4, 1]
}
```
