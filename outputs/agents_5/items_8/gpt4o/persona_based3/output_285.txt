Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  99  60  85  44  83  18  57
1  85  32  69  62  45  90  41  11
2  20  63  27  59  44  42  99  16
3  59  57  82   8  99   1  13  36
4  74  63  10  48   1  77  22   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This method maximizes the product of the utilities obtained by each agent and is often used as a proxy for achieving fairness, especially when dealing with indivisible items.

Let's start by looking at the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [84, 99, 60, 85, 44, 83, 18, 57]
Agent 1: [85, 32, 69, 62, 45, 90, 41, 11]
Agent 2: [20, 63, 27, 59, 44, 42, 99, 16]
Agent 3: [59, 57, 82, 8, 99, 1, 13, 36]
Agent 4: [74, 63, 10, 48, 1, 77, 22, 0]
```

We'll aim to allocate the items such that:

1. Each agent receives at least one item.
2. The allocation maximizes the product of utilities for all agents.

After examining the valuations, a fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Item 1, Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 0, Item 2, Item 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their utility given the constraints, while also ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 2, 7]
}
```
