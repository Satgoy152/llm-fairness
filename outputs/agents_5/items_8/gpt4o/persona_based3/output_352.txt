Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  36  13  69  84  71  51  47
1  41  83  47  23  13  43  93  46
2  40  70  61  76  84   6  12  75
3  65  61  64  69  64  57  73  85
4  93  91  79  30  45  21  50  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To create a fair allocation of the items among the agents that minimizes envy, we can use an envy-free allocation approach. One common strategy is to apply the "round-robin" method or to optimize based on each agent's valuation of the items. Here, I'll attempt to assign items such that each agent's preferences are respected as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 4 (84), then item 0 (72).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 6 (93), then item 1 (83).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 4 (84), then item 3 (76).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 7 (85), then item 6 (73).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 0 (93), then item 1 (91).

Considering each agent's highest preference and ensuring no item is assigned to multiple agents, we can proceed with the following allocation:

- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 4 (highest valuation)
- **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 4 (second highest valuation)
- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 3 (next highest preference after their top two)
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 2 (highest remaining valuation)
- **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 0 (highest remaining valuation)
- **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 1 (best available after higher preferences assigned)
- **Item 6**: Assign to Agent 1 (highest valuation)
- **Item 7**: Assign to Agent 3 (highest valuation)

This results in:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [5, 6]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [2, 7]
- Agent 4: [0, 1]

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring each item is assigned only once.
