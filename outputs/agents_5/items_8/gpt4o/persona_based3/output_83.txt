Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44   5  79  36  31  38   2  95
1  82  32  19   9  62  90   7  63
2  13  68  63  93  57  30  77  65
3  49  71  40  38  51  94  39  49
4  69  80  26  44  97  48  64  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method similar to the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" approach. This approach often ensures that each agent has a chance to get items they value highly, which can help in reducing envy.

Here's how we can do it step-by-step:

1. **Determine Preferences**: Each agent will prioritize items based on their valuations.
2. **Allocate in Rounds**: Allow agents to pick items in turns based on their highest preference that is still available.
3. **Continue Until All Items Are Allocated**: Repeat the process until all items have been allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Round 1**:
  - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 95).
  - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 82).
  - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 93).
  - Agent 3 picks item 5 (value 94).
  - Agent 4 picks item 4 (value 97).

- **Round 2** (remaining items: 1, 2, 6):
  - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 79).
  - Agent 1 picks item 5 was picked by Agent 3, next highest is item 6 (value 7).
  - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 68).
  - Agent 3 picks item 0 was picked by Agent 1, next highest is item 1 (value 71).
  - Agent 4 picks item 7 was picked by Agent 0, next highest is item 6 (value 64).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets a fair share without exceeding 8 items in total:

- **Final Allocation**:
  - Agent 0: [7, 2]
  - Agent 1: [0, 6]
  - Agent 2: [3, 1]
  - Agent 3: [5]
  - Agent 4: [4]

This allocation gives each agent items based on their highest preferences as the picking proceeded and ensures all items are allocated.

### JSON Format Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, and all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents.
