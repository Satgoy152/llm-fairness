Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  85  54  52  15  44  16  37
1  96  97  59  76  57  92  58  38
2  72   0   1  47  61  70  80  91
3  92  59  62  58  47  71  39  29
4  29  14  18  73  17  39  89  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own, based on their valuations. Here, we have 5 agents and 8 items, and each agent will receive an integer number of items.

One way to approach this is to use a technique like the envy-free round-robin algorithm, where agents pick items in turns based on their preferences. Given the valuations, we can determine an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1. Allocating these items to agent 0:
   - Items: [0, 1]

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 highly. Allocating item 5 to agent 1:
   - Items: [5]

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 places the highest valuation on item 7. Allocating item 7 to agent 2:
   - Items: [7]

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 3. Allocating item 3 to agent 3:
   - Items: [3]

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 places the highest valuation on item 6. Allocating item 6 to agent 4:
   - Items: [6]

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7. The remaining items are 2 and 4.

6. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 relatively high. Allocating item 2 to agent 1:
   - Items: [5, 2]

7. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 4 higher than any other unallocated item. Allocating item 4 to agent 4:
   - Items: [6, 4]

The allocation is now complete. Each agent has been assigned items based on their preferences. The allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 4]
}
```
