Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  87  21  19  73  12  11  96
1  44  59  76  65  14   4  43  97
2   2   0  74  14  47  76   9   4
3  73  40  70  41  51  49  93  47
4   4  49  55  40  35  42  91  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to achieve envy-freeness, meaning that no agent should prefer the allocation of items received by another agent over their own allocation. This is a complex problem, and finding an exact envy-free allocation is often challenging, especially with integer allocations. However, we will strive for a fair and balanced distribution based on the given valuations.

First, let's summarize the total valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 29 + 87 + 21 + 19 + 73 + 12 + 11 + 96 = 348
- Agent 1: 44 + 59 + 76 + 65 + 14 + 4 + 43 + 97 = 402
- Agent 2: 2 + 0 + 74 + 14 + 47 + 76 + 9 + 4 = 226
- Agent 3: 73 + 40 + 70 + 41 + 51 + 49 + 93 + 47 = 464
- Agent 4: 4 + 49 + 55 + 40 + 35 + 42 + 91 + 68 = 384

Now, let's proceed with a fair allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest total valuation, so we should allocate high-valued items that they value more compared to others.
2. **Agent 1** also has a high total valuation and should receive items they value highly.
3. **Agent 4**, with a moderate total valuation, should receive items they value significantly.
4. **Agent 0** and **Agent 2** have lower total valuations, so they can be allocated remaining items that others value less.

Considering these factors, here is a proposed allocation:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (97), as they value it highly.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (93), as they value it highly.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (76), as they value it highly.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (87), as they value it highly.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (35), as they value it moderately.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (73), as they value it highly and it's their second-highest value.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (65), as a high-value item for them.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (21), as they value it more than others.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives at least one item they value significantly, while also keeping the overall distribution as balanced as possible.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
