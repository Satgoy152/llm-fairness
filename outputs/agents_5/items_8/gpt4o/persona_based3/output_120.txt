Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  92  29  60  12  83  81  37
1  39  64  75  95  53  98  67  70
2  53  92  39  51  33  38  97  51
3  90   5  32  97  28  22  60  67
4  98  11  89  34  23  87  48  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the complexity of ensuring absolute envy-freeness, we'll aim to allocate items such that the perceived values are balanced across the agents as much as possible. Here's one approach to achieve this:

### Steps:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their preferences.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest relative valuation to ensure each agent gets items they value highly.

3. **Rebalance**: Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives a balanced share, aiming to minimize envy.

Let's compute the allocations:

Agent 0:
- Values: [45, 92, 29, 60, 12, 83, 81, 37]
- Total Value: 439

Agent 1:
- Values: [39, 64, 75, 95, 53, 98, 67, 70]
- Total Value: 561

Agent 2:
- Values: [53, 92, 39, 51, 33, 38, 97, 51]
- Total Value: 454

Agent 3:
- Values: [90, 5, 32, 97, 28, 22, 60, 67]
- Total Value: 401

Agent 4:
- Values: [98, 11, 89, 34, 23, 87, 48, 71]
- Total Value: 461

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 1** gets item 5 (98) and item 3 (95) - high value items for Agent 1.
- **Agent 4** gets item 0 (98) and item 2 (89) - high value items for Agent 4.
- **Agent 3** gets item 6 (60) and item 7 (67) - items with significant value for Agent 3.
- **Agent 2** gets item 1 (92) - one of the highest values available.
- **Agent 0** gets item 4 (12) - remaining item to ensure all items are allocated.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to balance the overall value each receives based on their preferences. The allocation is not completely envy-free but is a fair approximation given the constraints.
