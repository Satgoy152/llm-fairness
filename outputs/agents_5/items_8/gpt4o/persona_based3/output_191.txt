Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  84  14  84  72  11  72  20
1   0  10   3  67  72  95  60  25
2   0  97  11  48  29  71  49   4
3  66  82  87  41  33  96  18  39
4  78  69   3   8  38   2  13  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider a method such as the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which attempts to maximize the product of the utilities of all agents. However, given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness and integer allocations simultaneously, we'll aim for a practical solution that is close to envy-freeness.

Let's first understand the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 1 and 3 the highest (84 each).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (95).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (97).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (87).
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (78).

A reasonable allocation strategy, given these valuations, is to try and give each agent their highest-valued item or one of the highest if possible, distributing the leftover items in a fair manner. 

Let's propose an allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, as it is their highest value (97).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it is their highest value (95).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 3, as it is their highest value (87).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 4, as it is their highest value (78).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as it is one of their highest values (84).

Now, we have 3 remaining items (4, 6, 7) to allocate among the agents:

6. Assign item 4 to Agent 0, since they value it (72) and it's a good pairing with item 3.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as they value it (60) and it complements their allocation.
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 3, as this adds value to their allocation (39).

This allocation aims to balance the distribution while respecting the high-valued preferences of each agent as much as possible. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [0]
}
```
