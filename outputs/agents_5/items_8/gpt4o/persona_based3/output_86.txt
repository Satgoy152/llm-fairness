Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  91  53  19  34  77  34  95
1  86  90  71  94  11  84   6  20
2  61  54   0  81  17  91  96  30
3  55  44  18  45  24   3  19  87
4   6  77  90   7  15  92  39  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To tackle this problem, we need to allocate the 8 items to the 5 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible. This could mean minimizing envy among the agents, which is a common objective in fair division.

A common strategy is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most preferred available item. However, given the specific valuations, a strategic allocation can provide a better result in terms of fairness and minimizing envy.

Let's start by examining some key points from the valuation matrix:

1. Agent 0 seems to value item 7 (95) highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 (94) the most.
3. Agent 2 appears to value item 6 (96) the most.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 (87) significantly.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 (90) highly.

Using this analysis, we can attempt an allocation by giving each agent one of their most valued items and then distributing the remaining items such that overall envy is minimized.

**Proposed Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Item 7 (highest value item for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (highest value item for agent 1)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (highest value item for agent 2)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (second highest value item for agent 3, since item 7 is already taken)
- Agent 4: Items 2 and 5 (highest and third highest value items for agent 4)

Now let's allocate the remaining items (0 and 4) to minimize overall envy:
- Agent 0: Also gets item 0 (next highest value for agent 0 after item 7)
- Agent 1: Also gets item 4 (minimizes envy as their other high-value items are taken)

This distribution ensures each agent gets at least one item they value relatively highly, and the remaining items are distributed to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations each agent has with the available items, ensuring that each agent ends up with items they value reasonably while minimizing possible envy between agents.
