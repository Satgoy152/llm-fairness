Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  35  57  19  76  80  23  97
1  52  31  63  70  91  72  12  49
2  82   6  87  52  64   6  65   2
3  18  73  48  99  65  98  50  17
4  89  45  59  78  92  14  33  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness or as close to it as possible, given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated.

### Steps for Fair Division:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** 
   - Agent 0: 2 + 35 + 57 + 19 + 76 + 80 + 23 + 97 = 389
   - Agent 1: 52 + 31 + 63 + 70 + 91 + 72 + 12 + 49 = 440
   - Agent 2: 82 + 6 + 87 + 52 + 64 + 6 + 65 + 2 = 364
   - Agent 3: 18 + 73 + 48 + 99 + 65 + 98 + 50 + 17 = 468
   - Agent 4: 89 + 45 + 59 + 78 + 92 + 14 + 33 + 90 = 500

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Starting with the items which have a significantly higher valuation for a particular agent, assign those items to that agent.

3. **Iterative Allocation:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. If this is not possible due to constraints, aim to minimize envy.

4. **Adjustment for Fairness:**
   - Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure that no agent is overly disadvantaged.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 7 the highest (97). Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 4 the highest (91). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 2 the highest (87). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 3 the highest (99). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 0 the highest (89). Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, distribute remaining items considering the next highest valued items for each agent, ensuring all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0:** Next highest valued item is 5 (80). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 3:** Next highest valued item is 5 (98). Since 5 is taken, assign item 1 (73) to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4:** Next highest valued item is 6 (33). Assign item 6 to Agent 4.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on the highest valuations.
