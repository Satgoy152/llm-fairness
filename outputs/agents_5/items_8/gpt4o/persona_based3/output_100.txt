Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  77   4  38  31  90  27  33
1  28  93  20  67  15   0  91  27
2  53  74  80  36  36   9  64  89
3  61  17  39  15  39   4   2  49
4   5  38  87  62  33   2   2  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that respects the valuations and ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, we can apply a method that considers each agent's preferences while attempting to minimize envy. One efficient approach is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, iterating through the items until all are allocated.

Let's allocate the items based on the valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it most at 73.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it most at 93.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it most at 87.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 67 (highest not yet used preference).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it at 39 (highest not yet used preference).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it most at 90.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it at 91 (highest not yet used preference).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it most at 89.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while distributing all items.
