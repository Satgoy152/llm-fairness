Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  96  93  66  10   2   8  93
1  49  56  74  21   6  37  72  13
2   8  55  55   1  18  16  92  25
3  67  33   4  30  15  11  69  41
4  37  21  36  77  39   3  78  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. However, given the constraints and discrete nature of items, perfect envy-freeness might not be attainable. We'll try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes perceived fairness based on the valuations.

First, let's examine the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 392
- Agent 1: 328
- Agent 2: 270
- Agent 3: 270
- Agent 4: 382

Now, let's attempt to allocate items by maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets approximately the same number of items.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 and item 2 very highly. They are also among the highest values overall, so we'll allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 highly, but since it's already allocated, we'll give them item 0 and item 6, which they value the next highest.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 6, but it's already allocated, so we'll allocate item 7 and item 5 to them.
4. **Agent 3** will receive item 3, which is one of their higher-valued items.
5. **Agent 4** will receive item 4, which they value relatively highly compared to others.

### Allocation:

Based on the analysis above, a proposed allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all 8 items are distributed. While not perfectly envy-free, this allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction given their valuations.
