Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  37  63  52  24  27  55  53
1  42  56  28  24  68   7   1  78
2  92  27  59  36  62   5  59  23
3  45  65  81  61   4  78  31  94
4  19  29  84  33  50  97  25  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [45 65 81 61  4 78 31 94]
 [19 29 84 33 50 97 25 11]]
Output:
To allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a fair division that minimizes envy. A popular method for achieving fairness in discrete item allocation is the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion. It ensures that any envy an agent may feel towards another agent can be eliminated by removing at most one item from the other agent's allocation.

Let's analyze the given valuation matrix and attempt to allocate the items in a way that satisfies the EF1 criterion:

```
Valuation Matrix:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  37  63  52  24  27  55  53
1  42  56  28  24  68   7   1  78
2  92  27  59  36  62   5  59  23
3  45  65  81  61   4  78  31  94
4  19  29  84  33  50  97  25  11
```

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest at 92. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Agent 4** values item 5 the highest at 97. Assign item 5 to Agent 4.
3. **Agent 3** values item 7 the highest at 94. Assign item 7 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest at 68. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
5. **Agent 0** values item 2 the highest at 63. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
6. **Agent 3** values item 3 second highest at 61. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
7. **Agent 0** values item 6 second highest at 55. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 1** values item 1 second highest at 56. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets items 7 and 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.

This allocation ensures each agent receives some of their most valued items, and minor adjustments can be made (if necessary) to minimize envy according to the EF1 criterion.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7, 3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
