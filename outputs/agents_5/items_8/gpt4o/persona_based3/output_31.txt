Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  92  90  83  50  95   0  10
1  37  29  58  30  23  99  99  77
2  31  62  66  76  34  38   5  52
3  22  68   9  29  93  36  47  91
4  87   0  39  17  76  51  57  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly and ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a greedy approach that considers each agent's valuations and aims to maximize their satisfaction. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's break down the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [62, 92, 90, 83, 50, 95, 0, 10]
Agent 1: [37, 29, 58, 30, 23, 99, 99, 77]
Agent 2: [31, 62, 66, 76, 34, 38, 5, 52]
Agent 3: [22, 68, 9, 29, 93, 36, 47, 91]
Agent 4: [87, 0, 39, 17, 76, 51, 57, 68]
```

A possible strategy is to allocate items based on the highest valuations while ensuring that each agent ends up with a similar total valuation. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0: Items 1 (valuation 92) and 5 (valuation 95)
2. Agent 1: Items 6 (valuation 99) and 7 (valuation 77)
3. Agent 2: Items 2 (valuation 66) and 3 (valuation 76)
4. Agent 3: Items 4 (valuation 93)
5. Agent 4: Item 0 (valuation 87)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, leading to a fair division based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```
