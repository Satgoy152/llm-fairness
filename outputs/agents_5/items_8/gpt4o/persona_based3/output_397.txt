Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  27  50  26  80  49  24  13
1  87  21   8  28  62  60   8  67
2  44  79  94  96  91  50  74  84
3  59   4  70  55  39  82  33  84
4  13   5  38  29  20  31  52  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy and maximize the total value for each agent. One common method in fair division is the "round-robin" allocation, where agents take turns picking their most preferred available item. This usually results in an allocation that is envy-free up to one item (EF1) in some cases.

Here's how the allocation could be done:

1. **Initialization:** Sort the agents based on their total valuation of all items, allowing those who value items most overall to pick first.
2. **Round-robin selection:** Starting with the agent with the highest total valuation, allow each agent to pick their most valued item that hasn't been allocated yet. Continue this process until all the items are allocated.

Given the valuations provided:

- **Agent 0**: Total value = 49 + 27 + 50 + 26 + 80 + 49 + 24 + 13 = 318
- **Agent 1**: Total value = 87 + 21 + 8 + 28 + 62 + 60 + 8 + 67 = 341
- **Agent 2**: Total value = 44 + 79 + 94 + 96 + 91 + 50 + 74 + 84 = 612
- **Agent 3**: Total value = 59 + 4 + 70 + 55 + 39 + 82 + 33 + 84 = 426
- **Agent 4**: Total value = 13 + 5 + 38 + 29 + 20 + 31 + 52 + 85 = 273

**Order of selection based on total valuation:**
1. Agent 2
2. Agent 3
3. Agent 1
4. Agent 0
5. Agent 4

**Allocation:**

- **Round 1:**
  - **Agent 2** selects item 3 (value 96).
  - **Agent 3** selects item 5 (value 82).
  - **Agent 1** selects item 0 (value 87).
  - **Agent 0** selects item 4 (value 80).
  - **Agent 4** selects item 7 (value 85).

- **Round 2:**
  - **Agent 2** selects item 2 (value 94).
  - **Agent 3** selects item 1 (value 4).
  - **Agent 1** selects item 6 (value 8).

Now, all 8 items have been allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [7]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated an integer number of items, and all items have been allocated.
