Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  81  99  15  22  10  11  63
1  22  60  55  16  88   0  67  49
2  67  37  18  10  80  75  71  39
3  92  16  36  82   0  95  28  62
4  47  95   6  93  19  20  39  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a satisfactory allocation of items according to their valuations. A common approach is to use the method of "Round Robin" or "Divide and Choose," but given the constraints and the need to manually ensure fairness, we will try to balance the total value perceived by each agent as much as possible.

Below is a potential allocation that attempts to balance the total value among agents:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all the items.
2. Allocate items to agents in such a way that each agent's total received value is as balanced as possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values: [18, 81, 99, 15, 22, 10, 11, 63]
- Agent 1 values: [22, 60, 55, 16, 88, 0, 67, 49]
- Agent 2 values: [67, 37, 18, 10, 80, 75, 71, 39]
- Agent 3 values: [92, 16, 36, 82, 0, 95, 28, 62]
- Agent 4 values: [47, 95, 6, 93, 19, 20, 39, 14]

With the aim of achieving a fair distribution, the items can be allocated as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 7] (Values: 99, 63)
- Agent 1: Items [4, 6] (Values: 88, 67)
- Agent 2: Items [5] (Values: 75)
- Agent 3: Items [0, 3] (Values: 92, 82)
- Agent 4: Items [1] (Values: 95)

This allocation ensures that:

- Agent 0 receives items they value highly.
- Agent 1 gets a mix of high-valued items.
- Agent 2 receives one of the most valuable items.
- Agent 3 gets two items with high personal value.
- Agent 4 receives the item they value the most.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent has a relatively balanced total value from their perspective, given the constraints and differences in valuations.
