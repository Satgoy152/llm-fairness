Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  62  41  72  33  67  68  70
1  98  76  56  58  52  90  83  45
2  23  27  14  41   3  81  63  97
3  34  28   3  71  46  46  15  20
4  16  88  54  70  96  88  60  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for envy-freeness and an equitable distribution. Let's consider a simple procedure that attempts to balance the allocations based on the given values.

Here's one potential fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most.
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 the most.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the most.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the most.

By distributing items according to these preferences and ensuring each agent gets some items, we can achieve an allocation that potentially minimizes envy:

- Allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once and that each agent is considered fairly.

After considering various distributions, here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 5]
- **Agent 1**: Items [0]
- **Agent 2**: Items [6, 7]
- **Agent 3**: Items [3]
- **Agent 4**: Items [2, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, given the constraints. Please note that achieving perfect envy-freeness in discrete allocations is complex, but this allocation attempts to balance the agents' preferences fairly.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
