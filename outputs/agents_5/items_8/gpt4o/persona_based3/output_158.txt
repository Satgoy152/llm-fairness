Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64   2  90  85  59  85  58  98
1   8  70  72  93  36   4  37  42
2  54  29  61  15  35  81  97  13
3  89  67   6  27  22  96  31  49
4  17   2  40   0  46  39  24  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll aim for an allocation that attempts to be envy-free, where possible, and ensures that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations.

We'll start by considering the highest valuations for each item and allocate them to the respective agents, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. We'll also ensure that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation based on the valuations:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 3 values it the highest at 89.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 70.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it the highest at 90.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it the highest at 93.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it the highest at 59.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 3 values it the highest at 96.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 2 values it the highest at 97.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it the highest at 98.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their highest preferences, but we need to check that every agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. 

Let's adjust to ensure all agents receive at least one item and the total allocation remains complete:

- **Agent 0:** Items [2, 4, 7]
- **Agent 1:** Item [1, 3]
- **Agent 2:** Item [6]
- **Agent 3:** Item [0, 5]
- **Agent 4:** Item [ ]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, except for one agent, which is acceptable under the constraints of the problem as long as the total number of items is allocated.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": []
}
```
