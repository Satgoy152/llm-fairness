Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  68  32   2  21   6  78  38
1  43  39  20  76  35  94  89  99
2  77  24  91  77   2  79  46  41
3  44  49  51   5  24  59  42  88
4  18  74  33  80  58  61   5   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and provides a relatively balanced distribution based on the valuations provided. One common approach to achieve this is through the "maximin" share guarantee, which ensures that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as they would in their worst-case fair share scenario.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  68  32   2  21   6  78  38
1  43  39  20  76  35  94  89  99
2  77  24  91  77   2  79  46  41
3  44  49  51   5  24  59  42  88
4  18  74  33  80  58  61   5   8
```

Let's proceed with a reasonable allocation based on the valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 highly (78), so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 7 (99), so we allocate item 7 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 2 (91), so we assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 (59) relatively high compared to others, so item 5 goes to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 (80) highly, so item 3 is allocated to agent 4.

For the remaining items, we can aim to balance out the allocation:

6. Agent 0 can receive item 0, which they value quite highly (54).
7. Agent 1 can take item 4, which they value at 35, filling out their allocation.
8. Agent 2 can receive item 1, which they value at 24.

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution among agents, and each agent gets at least one item they value relatively highly.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
