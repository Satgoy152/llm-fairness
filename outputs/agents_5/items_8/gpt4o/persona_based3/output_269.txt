Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  24   5  33  66  20  56   5
1   3  83  75  24  46  93  16  92
2  27  71  39  54  95   4   1  21
3  33  24  77  59  87  90  10  32
4  97  95  55  52  13  63  16  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider a fair division method that ensures envy-freeness and efficiency. One common approach is to use the maximum envy-free allocation, where each agent gets a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to minimize envy and ensure that each agent is satisfied with their received items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Evaluate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences.
2. Assign items to agents in a way that maximizes the sum of the agents' valuations for their allocated items, while also trying to ensure that no agent envies another.

Let's calculate a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Values items based on their highest values, such as items [4, 6], which have values 66 and 56.
- Agent 1: Prefers items like [5, 7], with values 93, and 92.
- Agent 2: Prefers item [4], with a value of 95.
- Agent 3: Prefers item [5], with a value of 90.
- Agent 4: Prefers items [0, 1], with values 97 and 95.

After considering the preferences and attempting to minimize envy, here is one potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 5 and 7.
- Agent 2 does not receive any items, as their highest preference overlaps with others who value those items more.
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 3.
- Agent 4 receives items 0 and 1.

This allocation attempts to balance the preferences while ensuring each agent is satisfied with the items they receive, given the constraints.
