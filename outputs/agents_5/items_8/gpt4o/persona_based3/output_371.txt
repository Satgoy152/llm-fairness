Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  52  15  37  50  23  52  34
1  30   0  52  70  66  31  62  25
2  40  10  99  34  70  88  20  72
3  75  52  63  56  71  42  18   6
4  93  34   1  23  79   2  96  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we'll use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that they received at least as much value as any other agent received, from their own perspective. We'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have a fair share according to their valuations.

Given the valuations, let's try to allocate the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while ensuring everyone receives a fair share of the total value.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: [1, 7]
   - Total value: 52 + 34 = 86

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: [2, 3]
   - Total value: 52 + 70 = 122

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: [5, 6]
   - Total value: 88 + 20 = 108

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: [0]
   - Total value: 75

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items: [4]
   - Total value: 79

This allocation tries to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value perceived by each agent. Each agent receives items such that they perceive a reasonable amount of value, minimizing envy.

Now, let me present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
