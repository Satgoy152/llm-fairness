Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44   3  25  80  86   3  56  64
1  53  15  26  89   4  84  22  40
2  86  70  38  33  50   2  62  85
3   6  47  71   3  53  29  75  46
4  63  46  10  57  85  30  35  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method called "round-robin" based on the highest valuation of the remaining items for each agent. This method aims to minimize envy by allowing agents to select the most valuable item available to them in turns.

Here's a step-by-step process to perform the allocation:

1. **Initialize**: Start with no items allocated to any agent.
2. **Round-Robin Selection**: Each agent, in turn, selects their most valued item from the remaining available items. Continue the process until all items are allocated.
3. **Track Allocations**: Record the items allocated to each agent.

Following this approach, the allocations are as follows:

1. **Agent 0** selects item 4 (value 86) as the highest value.
2. **Agent 1** selects item 3 (value 89) as the highest value.
3. **Agent 2** selects item 0 (value 86) as the highest value.
4. **Agent 3** selects item 6 (value 75) as the highest value.
5. **Agent 4** selects item 7 (value 48) as the highest value.
6. **Agent 0** selects item 2 (value 25) as the next highest available.
7. **Agent 1** selects item 5 (value 84) as the next highest available.
8. **Agent 4** selects item 1 (value 46) as the next highest available.

Now, letâ€™s present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that are valuable to them, attempting to minimize envy and distribute items fairly.
