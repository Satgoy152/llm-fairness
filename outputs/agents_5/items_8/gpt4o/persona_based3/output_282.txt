Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  11  19  92  91  35  63  88
1   3  40  61  12   0  38  43  36
2  95  52  91  93  91  57  20  38
3  87  14   9  57  85  37  40  41
4  19  87  11  38  52  29  89  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received an appropriate share of the items based on their valuations. Given that each agent's valuation of the items varies significantly, we'll employ a strategy to maximize each agent's satisfaction relative to their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: We begin by identifying the items each agent values the most, prioritizing allocating these items to maximize perceived fairness.
  
2. **Allocate Items**: We then assign these high-value items to the respective agents, ensuring each agent gets an item they value significantly.

3. **Adjust for Remaining Items**: If there are items left unallocated, we assign them based on maximizing the total value for each agent, ensuring that no agent receives more items than others unless unavoidable.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 0 and item 3 the highest (both at 92).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the highest (61).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the highest (93), but it's already taken by Agent 0; next highest is item 0 (95).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the highest (87), but it's already taken by Agent 2; next highest is item 4 (85).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 1 the highest (87).

Now, let's distribute the remaining items:

- **Item 5**: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 2 (57).
- **Item 6**: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 4 (89).
- **Item 7**: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 0 (88).

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [2]
- Agent 2: Items [5]
- Agent 3: Items [4]
- Agent 4: Items [1, 6]

Finally, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints, ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.
