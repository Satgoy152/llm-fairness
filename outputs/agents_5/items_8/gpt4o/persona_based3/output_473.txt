Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  50  58  63  68  41  35  76
1   2  38   0  80  96  44  84  95
2  12  95  54  39  27  21   2  38
3  60  53  78  12  14  16  11  55
4  47  78  71  44  28   0  88   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness among the agents, we need to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation. One common approach is to maximize the minimum utility each agent receives or to ensure that no agent envies another's allocation.

Let's evaluate the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 0, 3, 4, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations for items 3, 4, 6, and 7.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuations for items 2 and 0.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 6.

Considering these preferences, try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction. We need to balance the allocation so that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, if possible.

Here's one potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4
  - This agent values 0 and 4 highly.
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 7
  - This agent values 3 and 7 highly.
- **Agent 2**: Item 1
  - This agent values 1 highly.
- **Agent 3**: Item 2
  - This agent values 2 highly.
- **Agent 4**: Items 5, 6
  - This agent values 6 highly.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value, reducing envy to the extent possible given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```
