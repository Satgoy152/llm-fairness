Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  65  55  25  52  36   5  15
1  47  72  70  38  14   9  44  13
2  37  97  71  81  68  52  67  23
3  18  78  74  21  86   3  30  12
4  12  82  35  36  63  42  80  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible, we will use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's value for their allocation, while also considering the overall distribution of value.

A simple greedy allocation method is to assign items to the agent who values them the most, provided that this does not create an imbalance in the number of items each agent receives. This approach will help in maximizing total satisfaction and minimizing envy among the agents.

Let's distribute the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (47).
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (97).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (70).
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (81).
5. Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (86).
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (52).
7. Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most (80).
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most (15).

We need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is as fair as possible. After the initial allocation, some agents might have more items than others. We'll need to re-evaluate the allocation to balance it out.

Adjusted allocation for fairness:

1. Agent 0: Gets items [7]
2. Agent 1: Gets items [0, 2]
3. Agent 2: Gets items [1, 3]
4. Agent 3: Gets item [4]
5. Agent 4: Gets items [5, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and items are distributed based on preferences to maximize fairness and satisfaction. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```
