Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  66  42  14  85  69   8  47
1  77  41  56  75  11  19  17  69
2  61  60  14  71  39  34  74  54
3  64  21  45  56  68   7  61  52
4  64  27  70  18  57  13  60   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ideally achieves envy-freeness. Considering the given valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach to assign the items to the agents based on their highest valuations. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 4 the most (value 85). We will assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 the most (value 77). We will assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 the most (value 74). We will assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 the most, but since item 0 is already assigned, we move to the next highest valuation, which is item 4. Since item 4 is also already assigned, we assign item 3 (value 56) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 2 the most (value 70). We will assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we have assigned 5 out of the 8 items. We need to assign the remaining 3 items (items 1, 5, and 7).

6. **Agent 0**: After item 4, Agent 0 values item 1 the most (value 66). We will assign item 1 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1**: After item 0, Agent 1 values item 3 the most, but it's already assigned. Next, they value item 7 (value 69). We will assign item 7 to Agent 1.
8. **Agent 2**: After item 6, Agent 2 values item 0 the most, but it's already assigned. Next, they value item 1, which is also assigned. They then value item 7, which is assigned. Thus, we assign item 5 (value 34) to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated. While not strictly envy-free, this allocation strives to minimize envy based on the highest available valuations.
