Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99   1   9  77  50  54  63  27
1  52  16  61  30   6  43  83  94
2  18   9  39  21  77  32  20  94
3  49  65  10  93  22  55  47  32
4  12  15  97  52   8  95  66  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider concepts like envy-freeness and maximizing the overall satisfaction of agents based on their valuations. This scenario involves finding an allocation that attempts to balance these factors as much as possible given the constraints.

The table of valuations shows how much each agent values each item. We will aim to allocate items in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes each agent's total valuation of their allocated items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: Determine the total valuation each agent has for all available items.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Try to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
3. **Adjust for Balance**: Check if any adjustments are needed to ensure fairness, possibly reallocating items to balance valuations.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 0**: Valued highest by agent 0 (99).
2. **Item 1**: Valued highest by agent 3 (65).
3. **Item 2**: Valued highest by agent 4 (97).
4. **Item 3**: Valued highest by agent 3 (93).
5. **Item 4**: Valued highest by agent 2 (77).
6. **Item 5**: Valued highest by agent 4 (95).
7. **Item 6**: Valued highest by agent 1 (83).
8. **Item 7**: Valued highest by agents 2 and 1 (94). Assign to agent 1 for balance.

Now, let's check if any agent can contribute to balancing by swapping items to reduce envy, but initially, let's propose this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items matches the number of available items. Adjustments can be made if further balancing is needed based on more complex fairness criteria or additional preferences.
