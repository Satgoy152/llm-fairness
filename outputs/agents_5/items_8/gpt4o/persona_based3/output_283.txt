Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  52  94  46  14  19  95  79
1  20   9  15  35  61  79  11  35
2  85  37  91  91  91  36  98  90
3  35  26  48  36  41  55  82   6
4  25   8  12  37  28  68  69  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraints. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  52  94  46  14  19  95  79
1  20   9  15  35  61  79  11  35
2  85  37  91  91  91  36  98  90
3  35  26  48  36  41  55  82   6
4  25   8  12  37  28  68  69  21
```

We need to allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents. One strategy is to consider the valuations and try to ensure that each agent gets items that maximize their total valuation, while also considering the envy-free criterion.

Let's allocate the items one by one, considering each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6 (98), so allocate item 6 to agent 2.
2. **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 2 (94), so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 0 and 7, among others, but let's allocate item 0 to agent 2 due to the high valuation.
4. **Agent 0** can receive item 7 (79), which is a high valuation for them.
5. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 5 (79), so allocate item 5 to agent 1.
6. **Agent 3** has a relatively high valuation for item 6, but since it's already allocated, let's allocate item 3 to agent 3 (36).
7. **Agent 4** can be allocated item 4 (28), given its availability and their valuation.
8. **Agent 3** can receive item 1, as it is the remaining item with decent valuation for them.

After this allocation, the distribution is as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 1]
- Agent 4: Item [4]

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items and utilizes all 8 items.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
