Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  26  19  51  14  87  56  83
1   5  63  94  58  93  78  87  87
2  34  56  18   5  22  74  82   0
3  83  49  60  55  98  75  80  12
4  44  54  63  20  30  88  67  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can apply a round-robin approach, considering each agent's highest-valued items. This method tries to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, reducing the potential for envy.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is for item 5 (87). Allocate item 5 to agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value is for item 2 (94). Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value is for item 6 (82). Allocate item 6 to agent 2.
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value is for item 4 (98). Allocate item 4 to agent 3.
   
5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value is for item 7 (89). Allocate item 7 to agent 4.

Now, each agent has received one item. Continue allocating the remaining items by considering the next highest values for each agent who hasn't received their top choices yet.

6. **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest value item is item 7 (83), but it's already taken. Next is item 3 (51). Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

7. **Agent 1**: 
   - Next highest value item is item 6 (87), but it's already taken. Next is item 5 (78). Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

8. **Agent 2**: 
   - Next highest value item is item 5 (74), but it's already taken. Next is item 1 (56). Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

9. **Agent 3**: 
   - Next highest value item is item 6 (80), but it's already taken. Next is item 5 (75), but it's already taken. Next is item 3 (55), but it's already taken. Next is item 0 (83). Allocate item 0 to agent 3.

10. **Agent 4**: 
    - Next highest value item is item 5 (88), but it's already taken. Next is item 6 (67), but it's already taken. Next is item 4 (30), but it's already taken. Next is item 0 (44), but it's already taken. Next is item 1 (54). Allocate item 1 to agent 4.

Correcting the allocation to ensure no duplicates and each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 3
- Agent 1: Items 2, 0
- Agent 2: Items 6, 1
- Agent 3: Items 4, 7
- Agent 4: No items required in this allocation

Now, let's ensure the total allocations are correct.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [4, 0],
    "4": [7]
}
```
