Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  77  64  29   0  61  11  28
1   2  89  15  30  22  12  68  94
2  46  30  39   4  58  33  15  32
3  32  81   8  86   7  71  89  72
4  36   6  89  92  58  46  26  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This is often approached by using algorithms like the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division methods. However, given the complexity and the discrete nature of this problem, I'll provide a heuristic approach to allocate these items:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We have 5 agents and 8 items.
   - Each agent must receive at least one item, but since we have more items than agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, ensuring that no two agents are assigned the same item initially.
   - After each agent receives one item, assign the remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent while minimizing envy.

3. **Implementation:**
   - For each agent, identify the item with the highest valuation that hasn't been allocated yet.
   - Distribute the remaining items based on maximizing their total value for each agent while ensuring that the allocation remains envy-free as much as possible.

Here is the resulting allocation, ensuring each agent gets an item and the total number of items adds up to 8:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

**Explanation:**
- Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so they receive item 0.
- Agent 1 receives their highest valued item available, which is item 1, and additionally item 7, which they value highly.
- Agent 2 receives item 4, which is one of their higher valued items.
- Agent 3 is allocated item 3 and item 5, both of which are highly valued by them.
- Agent 4 receives items 2 and 6, both of which are among their higher valued items.

This allocation tries to balance the total value received by each agent while considering their individual preferences.
