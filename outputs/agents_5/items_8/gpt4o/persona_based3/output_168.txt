Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  52  56  45  52  45  71  15
1  87  63  48  38  28  66  45  85
2  18  35   3  64   5  39  50  34
3  14  86  94  33  62  94   0  97
4  68  44  35  71  99   8  58  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This method seeks to maximize the product of the utilities each agent receives, which tends to produce allocations that are both efficient and fair.

Let's consider the given valuations and attempt an allocation:

### Valuations Matrix:
```
|     | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
|  0  | 28 | 52 | 56 | 45 | 52 | 45 | 71 | 15 |
|  1  | 87 | 63 | 48 | 38 | 28 | 66 | 45 | 85 |
|  2  | 18 | 35 |  3 | 64 |  5 | 39 | 50 | 34 |
|  3  | 14 | 86 | 94 | 33 | 62 | 94 |  0 | 97 |
|  4  | 68 | 44 | 35 | 71 | 99 |  8 | 58 | 36 |
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 0 (87). Assign item 0 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 2 (94). Assign item 2 to agent 3.
3. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 4 (99). Assign item 4 to agent 4.
4. **Agent 3** also has the highest valuation for item 5 (94). Assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 7 (97). Assign item 7 to agent 3.
6. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 3 (71). Assign item 3 to agent 4.
7. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (71). Assign item 6 to agent 0.
8. **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 1 (52). Assign item 1 to agent 0.

This allocation should ensure that the total number of items is exactly 8, with each agent getting an integer number of items:

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 5, 7],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items aligning with their highest valuations, and no items are left unallocated.
