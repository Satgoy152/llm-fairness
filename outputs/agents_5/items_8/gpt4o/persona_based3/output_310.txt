Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  93  99  25  94  44  42  75
1  67  61  11  80  62  62  52  73
2  57  60  10  97  39  11  48  87
3  44  97  76  62  95   5  17  18
4  22  20  33  81  56  66  13  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the problem of fairly allocating the 8 items among the 5 agents, we aim to achieve allocations that consider the valuations of the agents. One common approach to fair division is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the constraints, complete envy-freeness may not be possible, but we can try to minimize envy.

Let's first consider the total valuations for each agent and the items that are most valuable to them:

1. **Agent 0** values items 2 (99), 1 (93), and 4 (94) highly.
2. **Agent 1** values items 3 (80), 0 (67), and 7 (73) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 3 (97) and 7 (87) highly.
4. **Agent 3** values items 1 (97), 4 (95), and 2 (76) highly.
5. **Agent 4** values item 7 (93) and 3 (81) highly.

Let's try to allocate the items in such a way that each agent receives items of high value to them and minimize any potential grievances:

1. Assign item 2 (99) to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 3 (97) to Agent 2, the next highest valuation.
3. Assign item 1 (97) to Agent 3.
4. Assign item 4 (94) to Agent 0, as they also highly value this item.
5. Assign item 7 (93) to Agent 4.
6. Assign item 0 (67) to Agent 1.
7. Assign item 5 (66) to Agent 4.
8. Assign item 6 (52) to Agent 1.

Now, each agent receives a subset of items:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 6
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Items 7, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, thus minimizing potential envy among agents. Let me now present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7, 5]
}
```
