Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  89  28  52  47  49  16   5
1   3  97  11  48  81  66  60  50
2  27  45  79  39  71  32  27  79
3  52  49  95  42  84   7  95  54
4  37   9  51  88  52  57  54   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we can use a method that aims to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One such approach is the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) allocation.

Given the valuations, let's try to allocate the items by observing which items are most valuable to each agent and ensuring that no agent envies another agent's allocation by more than one item:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent.** 
2. **Distribute items based on these preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.**
3. **Adjust to achieve EF1 allocation by swapping items if necessary.**

Here's the proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1, but it's already taken, so item 4 is next.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 2, but it's already taken, so item 6 is next.
- Agent 4 highly values item 3.

Now, distribute remaining items to balance allocations:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 as well.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 7.
- Agent 4 gets item 3 as well.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and attempts to minimize envy by assigning high-value items based on preferences.

Here's the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the distribution of items to minimize envy while ensuring all 8 items are allocated.
