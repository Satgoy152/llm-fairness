Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  76  88  15  97  33  72  87
1  45  55  10  21  67  27  50  26
2  71  30  46  75  13  28   1  87
3  92  96  60  63  12  35  42  20
4  92  19  11  45  29  21  28  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to ensure envy-freeness, we can use a method that aims to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Given the constraint of integer allocations and the need to allocate all items, we'll proceed by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring a balanced distribution.

Let's start by assessing each agent's highest preferences and attempt to distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 4 the most at 97, followed by item 2 (88) and item 7 (87).
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 4 the most at 67, followed by item 1 (55).
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 7 the most at 87, followed by item 3 (75).
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 1 the most at 96, followed by item 0 (92).
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 0 and item 3 equally at 92.

We'll try to give each agent their highest possible valued items while ensuring that no agent is left without items and that all items are allocated.

### Allocation Strategy:

- **Agent 0:**  
  - Assign item 4 (highest value 97).
  - Assign item 2 (next highest value 88).

- **Agent 1:**  
  - Assign item 1 (highest available value 55).

- **Agent 2:**  
  - Assign item 7 (highest value 87).
  - Assign item 3 (next highest value 75).

- **Agent 3:**  
  - Assign item 0 (next highest available value 92).

- **Agent 4:**  
  - Assign item 5 (highest available value 21).
  - Assign item 6 (next highest available value 28).

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items. The allocations are balanced according to the agents' preferences as much as possible given the constraints.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```
