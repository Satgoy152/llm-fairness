Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  71  75  76  96  12  29  11
1  86  51  87  19   3  63  11  95
2  58  39  90  35  70  34  26  92
3  92  85   1  72  50   3  25  49
4  91  24  92  96  54  98  62  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and attempt an envy-free allocation, we can use the method of maximizing each agent's total valuation while attempting to equalize the perceived value among agents. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, it is not possible to allocate the items equally, but we can aim to maximize fairness by considering each agent's preferences.

Let's start by evaluating the highest value each agent assigns to the items:

- Agent 0: Highest values are 96 (item 4) and 92 (item 0).
- Agent 1: Highest values are 95 (item 7) and 87 (item 2).
- Agent 2: Highest values are 92 (item 7) and 90 (item 2).
- Agent 3: Highest values are 92 (item 0) and 85 (item 1).
- Agent 4: Highest values are 98 (item 5) and 96 (item 3).

A possible allocation strategy is to assign the items with the highest values to each agent where possible and then allocate the remaining items based on the next highest preferences:

1. Assign item 4 (value 96) to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 7 (value 95) to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 (value 90) to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 1 (value 85) to Agent 3.
5. Assign item 5 (value 98) to Agent 4.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 0: Assign to Agent 3 (value 92).
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 4 (value 96).
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 0 (value 29).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's perceived value and reduce envy. The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 0],
    "4": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 8.
