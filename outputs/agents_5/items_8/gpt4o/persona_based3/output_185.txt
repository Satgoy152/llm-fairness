Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84   4   8   0  76   5  61  66
1  31  77  56  95  56  71  58   2
2  74  97  84  30  48  94   2   5
3  14   4  21  22  17  73  34  65
4  57   6  41  61  71  87  15  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own, based on their valuations. Given the valuations and the number of items, one way to approach this is through a method that ensures each agent receives items optimizing their satisfaction. However, finding a perfect envy-free allocation with integer constraints is not always possible, especially in a small example like this, but we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest, so we can allocate item 0 to them.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, so we can allocate item 3 to them.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest, so we can allocate item 1 to them.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest, so we can allocate item 5 to them.
- Agent 4 values item 7 the highest, so we can allocate item 7 to them.

Now, we allocate the remaining items by looking at the next highest preferences that are still available:

- Agent 0's next highest-valued item is item 4, so they get item 4.
- Agent 1's next highest-valued item is item 6, so they get item 6.
- Agent 2's next highest-valued item is item 2, so they get item 2.

This allocation can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items, considering their highest preferences first, and distributes all 8 items.
