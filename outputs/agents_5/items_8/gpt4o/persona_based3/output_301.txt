Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  53  96  42  81  61  90  79
1  26  76  51  82  95  36  35  17
2  41  62  67  35  43  95  47  20
3  86  18  32  86   4  86  81  96
4   9  27  67  54  37  15  28   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method based on maximizing the sum of values for each agent's allocation. The goal is to allocate items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own preferences.

Given the valuations, we can adopt a simple "greedy" approach where we allocate the highest valued item available for each agent iteratively, while ensuring that each item is allocated only once.

Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. Sort each agent's item preferences from highest to lowest.
2. Allocate items to agents starting from the highest preference that hasn't been allocated yet.
3. Continue allocating until all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with this allocation process:

1. **Agent 0's preferences**: [2:96, 6:90, 0:88, 4:81, 7:79, 5:61, 1:53, 3:42]
2. **Agent 1's preferences**: [4:95, 3:82, 1:76, 2:51, 5:36, 6:35, 0:26, 7:17]
3. **Agent 2's preferences**: [5:95, 2:67, 1:62, 6:47, 4:43, 0:41, 3:35, 7:20]
4. **Agent 3's preferences**: [7:96, 0:86, 3:86, 5:86, 6:81, 2:32, 1:18, 4:4]
5. **Agent 4's preferences**: [2:67, 3:54, 4:37, 1:27, 5:15, 6:28, 0:9, 7:2]

Now, let's allocate:

1. **Item Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 takes item 2 (highest valuation for 0 that is unallocated).
   - Agent 1 takes item 4.
   - Agent 2 takes item 5.
   - Agent 3 takes item 7.
   - Agent 4 takes item 3.

Remaining items: 0, 1, 6

2. **Second round**:
   - Agent 0 takes item 6.
   - Agent 1 takes item 1.
   - Agent 3 takes item 0.

All items are now allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7, 0],
    "4": [3]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences while distributing all items.
