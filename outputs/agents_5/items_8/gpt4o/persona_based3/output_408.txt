Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43   0  41  54  99  72  84  57
1  94   9  50  67   6  52  96  39
2  23  10  64  14  78  11  15  90
3   2  93   2  94  68  61  23  69
4  49  44  91  74  57  95  90  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we can use a method like the round-robin algorithm, where each agent takes turns picking their most valued item until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 99).
   - Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 96).
   - Agent 2 picks item 7 (value 90).
   - Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 94).
   - Agent 4 picks item 5 (value 95).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Remaining items: 0, 1, 2.
   - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 84), but since it's already taken, they take the next best available item 3 (value 54), which was already taken, so they pick item 2 (value 41).
   - Agent 1 now takes item 0 (value 94).
   - Agent 2 takes item 2 (value 64), which is already taken by agent 0, so they take item 0 (value 23), which is already taken, so they take item 1 (value 10).
   - Agent 3 takes item 5 (value 61), which is already taken, so they take item 1 (value 93).
   - Agent 4 takes item 0 (value 49), which is already taken, so they take item 2 (value 91).

After reviewing the selection process and adjusting for previously allocated items, the following allocation can be considered:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's preference for individual items and aims for envy-freeness by allowing each agent to select their highest-valued available item.
