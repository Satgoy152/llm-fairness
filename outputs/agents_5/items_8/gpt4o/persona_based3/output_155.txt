Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  28  97  38   0   7   5   9
1   8  39  26  95  69   9  71  87
2  64  54  38  94  92  26  31  90
3  68  38  44  83  92  56  23  94
4  79  44  72   1   0  82  74   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free distribution. Envy-freeness means that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their individual valuations. Given that we have 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others, but the ideal is to minimize any potential envy through a strategic allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction with their own bundle.

Here's one way to allocate the items, taking into consideration the agents' valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 0 highly, so we allocate item 0 to them.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 3 highly, so we allocate item 3 to them.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 4 highly, so we allocate item 4 to them.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 7 highly, so we allocate item 7 to them.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 5 highly, so we allocate item 5 to them.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 2, 6) to maintain fairness:

- **Agent 0:** Already has item 0, let's give them item 1 as well, which they value more than other agents.
- **Agent 2:** Already has item 4, let's give them item 2 as well, which they value reasonably.
- **Agent 4:** Already has item 5, let's give them item 6 as well, which they value more than other agents.

This results in the following allocation that aims to balance the distribution based on individual item valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation seeks to maximize the happiness of each agent by giving them items they value highly, while ensuring that no agent is significantly envious of another's allocation.
