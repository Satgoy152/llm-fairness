Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  48  65   9  88  39  19  50
1  79  69  65  29   5  64  18  79
2  52  90  60  16  61   4  87  55
3  56  36  41  41  46  92  22  48
4  84  57  81  36  23  97  42  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method that involves maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible given the constraints, so the goal is to get as close as possible to a fair allocation.

Given the valuations, we will look for a strategy that distributes the items based on maximizing the utility for each agent and balancing the distribution so that no agent feels significantly envious of another's allocation. Here is one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Distribute items to agents based on their highest preferences, ensuring that the items are spread out to avoid concentration of high-value items to a single agent.

Let's proceed with these calculations:

- Total valuations for each agent:
  - Agent 0: 83 + 48 + 65 + 9 + 88 + 39 + 19 + 50 = 401
  - Agent 1: 79 + 69 + 65 + 29 + 5 + 64 + 18 + 79 = 408
  - Agent 2: 52 + 90 + 60 + 16 + 61 + 4 + 87 + 55 = 425
  - Agent 3: 56 + 36 + 41 + 41 + 46 + 92 + 22 + 48 = 382
  - Agent 4: 84 + 57 + 81 + 36 + 23 + 97 + 42 + 79 = 499

- Allocate items by allowing each agent to pick items starting with their highest valued ones, ensuring that no agent receives more than a fair share:

Given the constraints and the goal of fairness and minimal envy, the following allocation aims to balance the values:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [5]
- Agent 4: Items [3]

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent receives and limits the potential for significant envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while attempting to minimize envy among agents.
