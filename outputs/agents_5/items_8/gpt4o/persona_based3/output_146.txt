Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  19   0  74  29   3  75  39
1  50  14  33  28  80  60  26  89
2  51  46  42  94  62  62  81  19
3  30   6  44   6  32  62  15  10
4  65  70  52  67   6  28  91  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items among the agents in a manner that is as fair as possible. We can aim for a form of fair allocation known as envy-freeness. An allocation is said to be envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuation matrix, we can approach the problem by attempting to maximize the satisfaction or value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring envy-freeness to the extent possible. We can use a greedy algorithm to assign items to agents based on their valuation, considering the overall fairness of the distribution.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent.** This helps in deciding which items are crucial for satisfying each agent.

2. **Iteratively assign items to agents** based on the highest remaining value for each unallocated item.

3. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item** if possible, to maintain a sense of fairness.

4. **Adjust allocations to address any apparent envy** if possible, by swapping items between agents to balance their satisfaction.

Following these steps, here is a proposed allocation:

- Assign item 6 to agent 0 (highest value for agent 0).
- Assign item 7 to agent 1 (highest value for agent 1).
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (highest value for agent 2).
- Assign item 5 to agent 3 (highest value for agent 3).
- Assign item 4 to agent 4 (highest value for agent 4).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 1, 2).

- Assign item 0 to agent 2 (second-highest value for agent 2).
- Assign item 1 to agent 4 (second-highest value for agent 4).
- Assign item 2 to agent 3 (second-highest value for agent 3).

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with items they highly value while trying to minimize envy. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, aiming for a fair distribution.
