Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  37  60  33  91  52  98  60
1  83  34  40  35  80  99  50  56
2  40  59   3   7  68  89  89  92
3  45  95   0  67  10  55  81  18
4  88  37  53  34  72   4  65  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their valuations. Given the valuations matrix, a simple approach to ensure fairness is to use a round-robin method based on each agent's highest priority items, or to apply an algorithm like the adjusted winner procedure. However, since this is a discrete problem and each agent must receive an integer number of items, I'll proceed with a heuristic approach to allocate items as fairly as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 6 (98) and 4 (91).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (99) and 0 (83).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 7 (92) and 5 (89).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (95) and 3 (67).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (88) and 4 (72).

Based on these preferences, we can start allocating:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item 6.
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 5.
- **Agent 2**: Gets item 7.
- **Agent 3**: Gets item 1.
- **Agent 4**: Gets item 0.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 4):

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 6. Next best is item 4.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 5. Next best is item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 7. Next best is item 4 (but already taken). Next is item 3.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 1. Next best is item 3 (but already taken). Next is item 2.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 0. Next best is item 4 (but already taken). Next is item 2.

Final allocation, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items [6, 4].
- **Agent 1**: Gets items [5, 3].
- **Agent 2**: Gets item [7].
- **Agent 3**: Gets item [1].
- **Agent 4**: Gets items [0, 2].

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance preferences by considering each agent's highest-valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.
