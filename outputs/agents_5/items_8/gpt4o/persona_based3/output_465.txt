Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  44  34  50   9  49  16  71
1  14  92   2  63  22  14  82  88
2  62  99  90   6  32  98  98  59
3  49  60  62  62  47  27  38  73
4  47  40  96  48  62  98  76  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we need to allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation. One method to approach this is to use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring that the distribution of items is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations to determine a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has particularly high valuations for items 0 and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 and 7 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 1, 2, 5, and 6 highly.
4. **Agent 3** has relatively balanced valuations, with item 7 being the highest.
5. **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 2, 5, and 6.

Considering these insights, we'll aim to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring every agent gets an integer number of items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [0, 7]. These are the items with the highest value for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [1]. This item is most valued by Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items [2, 5]. These items are among the highest valued by Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item [3]. This gives Agent 3 a fair share considering their balanced valuations.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate items [4, 6]. These items are highly valued by Agent 4.

With this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
