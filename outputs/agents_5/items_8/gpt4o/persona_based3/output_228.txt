Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  22  76  56  34  21  21  26
1  12  29  51   6  17   8   6  92
2  10  47  97  36  17  46  91   5
3  74  50  63  24  60  32  68  28
4  81  69  87  23  39  12   2  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair and envy-free allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

One approach to achieve fairness is to use the "Round Robin" method combined with the "Envy-Free up to one item (EF1)" criterion. This method involves agents taking turns selecting their most valued item that hasn't been allocated yet, while ensuring that no agent envies another agent's allocation if the other agent gives up one item.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 76)
   - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 92)
   - Agent 2 picks item 6 (value 91)
   - Agent 3 picks item 0 (value 74)
   - Agent 4 picks item 4 (value 39)

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 56)
   - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 29)
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 46)

At this point, all items have been allocated. Each agent receives the items they value highly, and any potential envy can be resolved by the EF1 criterion, meaning that any agent would not envy another's allocation if one item is removed from the envied allocation. 

Let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items [2, 3]
- Agent 1 gets items [7, 1]
- Agent 2 gets items [6, 5]
- Agent 3 gets item [0]
- Agent 4 gets item [4]

Now, I'll present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
