Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  40  70  14   8  60  67  92
1  37  34  25  96  98   9  14  51
2  76  32  92  74   9  65  92  69
3  78  60  34  30  13  15  94  34
4  79  59  19  71  63  11  83  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to maximize each agent’s satisfaction given their preferences. One common method is to use a round-robin approach or a variation of it that considers the agents' valuations of the items.

Here’s an allocation strategy that aims to balance the interests of each agent:

1. **Agent 0** values item 7 the most (92), followed by item 2 (70). 
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (98), followed by item 3 (96).
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most (92), followed by item 6 (92).
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the most (94), followed by item 0 (78).
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the most (79), followed by item 6 (83).

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item 7 (92), which is the highest valued item for them.
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 4 (98), which is the highest valued item for them.
- **Agent 2**: Gets item 2 (92), which is the highest valued item for them.
- **Agent 3**: Gets item 6 (94), which is the highest valued item for them.
- **Agent 4**: Gets item 0 (79), which is the second-highest valued item for them.

Now, we allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (40) is the next highest valued unallocated item.
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (65) is the next highest valued unallocated item.
- **Agent 4**: Item 3 (71) is the next highest valued unallocated item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one of their top-valued items, aiming to maintain fairness and envy-freeness. 

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```
