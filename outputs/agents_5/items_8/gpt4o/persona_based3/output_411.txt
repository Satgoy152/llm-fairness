Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  40   4  92  57  26  56  15
1  98  27  42  24  80  61  94  30
2  59  78  87  38  31  52  89  26
3  94  79  54  62  35  74   0  11
4   5  13  58  45  31  34  75  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we want to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents and ensures every agent receives an integer number of items. We'll use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, to promote fairness.

Given the valuation matrix, we can proceed with the allocation by examining each agent's highest valuations and aiming to distribute items in a way that balances these high values across the agents.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0 (98), 6 (94), and 4 (80).
2. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 0 (94), but slightly less than Agent 1.
3. **Agent 0** values item 3 highly (92).
4. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 2 (87) and 6 (89).
5. **Agent 4** has no extremely high valuations but has moderate values for items 7 (87) and 2 (58).

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 1** gets items 0 and 6, as these are the highest for them and they have relatively higher valuations compared to others.
- **Agent 0** gets item 3, as it is the highest value for them and less contested.
- **Agent 2** receives item 2, as it is one of the top values for them.
- **Agent 3** receives item 5, balancing their moderate value against other high allocations.
- **Agent 4** receives items 4 and 7, as they provide a good balance of moderate values and are less contested.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated, and each agent is included in the final allocation.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that closely match their highest valuations while maintaining a fair distribution across all agents.
