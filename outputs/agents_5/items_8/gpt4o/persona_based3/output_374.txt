Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  68  76  57  12  72  97  14
1  53  40  20  53  93  86  86  91
2  13  50  98  39  43  94  25  31
3  30  13  60  19  63  39  11  84
4  52   0  53  17  22  87  65  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in a way that minimizes envy, we can use the Envy-Free (EF) fairness concept. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent to their own bundle. However, finding a perfect envy-free allocation is computationally complex and may not always be possible, especially when the number of agents is not a divisor of the number of items.

Given the valuations in the table, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations. Here’s how the allocation could look:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values items 6 and 5, so we can allocate those items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values items 4 and 7, so we can allocate those items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values items 2 and 5, but item 5 is already allocated. We can allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 7, but it's already allocated. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 could receive items 0 and 1 as they are relatively higher valued for Agent 4 compared to other agents.

Adjusting for the remaining items and ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, here’s a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuation preferences of the agents while distributing the items fairly according to their relative preferences. Note that perfect envy-freeness may not be achievable, but the allocation minimizes potential envy given the constraints.
