Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33   1  41  23  76  69  74  77
1  74  75  51  52  83  37  97   3
2  46  77  35  98  87  71  29  74
3  18  41   2  61  14  84  17  31
4  92  57  87  55  16  87  36  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. One method to accomplish this is by using an algorithm like the "Envy-Free Matching" or "Max-Min Fair Share." Here, I'll apply a heuristic approach to ensure a fair division of items based on the valuations provided.

Let's summarize the approach:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate items one by one, ensuring that each step attempts to minimize envy by considering agent preferences.
2. **Iterative Adjustment**: If needed, adjust allocations to further balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 4, who values it the most (92).
2. **Item 1**: Assign to Agent 2, who values it the most (77).
3. **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 0, who values it the most (41).
4. **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 2, who values it the most (98).
5. **Item 4**: Assign to Agent 1, who values it the most (83).
6. **Item 5**: Assign to Agent 3, who values it the most (84).
7. **Item 6**: Assign to Agent 1, who values it the most (97).
8. **Item 7**: Assign to Agent 0, who values it the most (77).

This allocation considers the highest valuations for each item and distributes them accordingly.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and every agent receives at least one item, except for the remaining agent who gets none.
