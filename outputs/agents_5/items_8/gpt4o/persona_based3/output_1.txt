Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  51   2   4  54  34  67  93
1  13  67  21  72  21  40  40  26
2  39  40  24  16  95  58  52  77
3  21  68  18  47  46  91  83  26
4  43  69  81  82  53  46  53  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a manner that aims for fairness and attempts to minimize envy, we can use various approaches such as maximizing the minimum utility (egalitarian approach), minimizing envy, or using the Nash Bargaining solution. Given the nature of this problem, I'll aim for an allocation that reasonably balances these aspects.

Here's the valuation table again for clarity:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  51   2   4  54  34  67  93
1  13  67  21  72  21  40  40  26
2  39  40  24  16  95  58  52  77
3  21  68  18  47  46  91  83  26
4  43  69  81  82  53  46  53  92
```

To achieve a fair allocation, let's assign items to agents based on their highest preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible and balancing the total value assigned to each agent.

1. **Agent 0** values item 7 the most (93).
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (72).
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the most (95).
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most (91).
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 the most (81).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items in a way that maintains balance:

6. **Agent 0** can also take item 6 (67).
7. **Agent 1** can take item 1 (67).
8. **Agent 4** can take item 0 (43).

This allocation allows each agent to receive items they highly value, and it ensures all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation should provide a relatively balanced distribution of value across the agents while ensuring each agent receives items they value highly.
