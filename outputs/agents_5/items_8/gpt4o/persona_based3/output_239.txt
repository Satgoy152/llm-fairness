Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  19  32  39  46  11  22  63
1  53  96  47  76  33  56  85  69
2  80   2  50  59  62  57  49  83
3  60  60  26  38  40  50   0  98
4  57  52  96  97  62   0  87  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they received a fair share based on their valuations. Given that there are 8 items and 5 agents, each agent can receive either 1 or 2 items. We will aim for the best possible allocation considering the provided valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve the allocation:

1. **Find the highest valued item for each agent**: This will guide us in understanding which item each agent values the most. 

2. **Initial Allocations**: Start by allocating the most valued items to each agent if possible, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items**: Once the highest valued items are allocated, distribute the remaining items based on the next highest preferences and ensure the allocations are as balanced as possible.

4. **Check for Envy-Freeness**: An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We make adjustments to reduce envy if possible.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (96).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (96).
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most (83).
- Agent 3 values item 7 the most (98), but it's already claimed by Agent 2, so allocate their next highest, item 1 (60).
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most (96).

Given these preferences, let's allocate the items and adjust as necessary:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3 (76, as item 1 is allocated to Agent 3)
- Agent 2: Items 7
- Agent 3: Items 1
- Agent 4: Items 2

Now, distribute the remaining items (4, 5, 6):

- Agent 0: Item 4 (46)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (85)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (57)

Final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```

These allocations aim to respect the highest preferences while ensuring each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
