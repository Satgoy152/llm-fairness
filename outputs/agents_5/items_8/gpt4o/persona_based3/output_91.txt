Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  75  41  41  95  16  29  51
1  77  81  75  99  72  60  93  43
2  55  43  56  83  66  98  26  75
3  34  62  10  10  61   1  56   4
4  89  37  19  56  52  96  65  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items. 

We'll employ a strategy to minimize envy by considering each agent's highest valued items and distributing them in a way that attempts to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's analyze the matrix briefly:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Highest: 95 (item 4)
  - Next: 75 (item 1)

- Agent 1 values:
  - Highest: 99 (item 3)
  - Next: 93 (item 6)

- Agent 2 values:
  - Highest: 98 (item 5)
  - Next: 83 (item 3)

- Agent 3 values:
  - Highest: 62 (item 1)
  - Next: 61 (item 4)

- Agent 4 values:
  - Highest: 96 (item 5)
  - Next: 93 (item 7)

Now, let's allocate:

1. Agent 0 receives item 4 (value: 95) and item 0 (value: 49)
2. Agent 1 receives item 6 (value: 93) and item 2 (value: 75)
3. Agent 2 receives item 5 (value: 98), which is their highest value.
4. Agent 3 receives item 1 (value: 62), their highest available value.
5. Agent 4 receives item 7 (value: 93) and item 3 (value: 56).

This allocation is fair in such a way that each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items, and no items are left unallocated. 

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and aims to minimize envy among the agents.
