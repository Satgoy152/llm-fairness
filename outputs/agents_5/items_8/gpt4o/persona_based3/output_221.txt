Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  37  15  54  69  12  80  37
1  65  47  43  24   6  33  48  88
2   3  86  58  27   0  79  31  21
3  92  68  72  60  90  28  22  35
4  33  96  66  49  53  77  97  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own, based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while ensuring fairness:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest Valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 6 (80), Item 4 (69)
   - Allocate: Item 0 and Item 6

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest Valuations: Item 7 (88), Item 0 (65), Item 1 (47)
   - Allocate: Item 7

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest Valuations: Item 1 (86), Item 5 (79), Item 2 (58)
   - Allocate: Item 1 and Item 5

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest Valuations: Item 4 (90), Item 2 (72), Item 0 (92)
   - Allocate: Item 4

5. Agent 4:
   - Highest Valuations: Item 6 (97), Item 1 (96), Item 5 (77)
   - Allocate: Item 2 and Item 3

This allocation ensures that each agent gets some of the items they value highly, and no items are left unallocated. Let's present the allocations in the specified json format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.
