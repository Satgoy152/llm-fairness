Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  20  86  34  25  41  17  99
1  60  52  59  17  59   9  33  48
2  70  47  58  49  64  19  93  23
3   6  99   2  12  98  11  71  57
4  86   5  59  76  34  12  34   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free and efficient as possible, considering each agent's valuations. Let's go through the process of assigning the items.

### Step 1: Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent
First, we will identify which items have the highest value for each agent:

- **Agent 0:** Highest value is item 7 (99).
- **Agent 1:** Highest value is item 0 (60).
- **Agent 2:** Highest value is item 6 (93).
- **Agent 3:** Highest value is item 1 (99).
- **Agent 4:** Highest value is item 0 (86).

### Step 2: Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation
Assign the highest valued item to each agent, ensuring no item is assigned more than once. If conflicts arise, we will attempt to assign the next highest valued items.

1. **Agent 0** gets item 7.
2. **Agent 1** gets item 0.
3. **Agent 2** gets item 6.
4. **Agent 3** gets item 1.
5. **Agent 4** now needs a different item since item 0 is taken. The next highest value for Agent 4 is item 3 (76).

### Step 3: Allocate the Remaining Items
We have 3 items left to allocate: items 2, 4, and 5. We will allocate these based on the next highest valuations that have not been utilized:

- **Item 2:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 86.
  - Agent 1 values it at 59.
  - Agent 2 values it at 58.
  - Agent 3 values it at 2.
  - Agent 4 values it at 59.
  - **Allocate item 2 to Agent 0** (highest).

- **Item 4:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 25.
  - Agent 1 values it at 59.
  - Agent 2 values it at 64.
  - Agent 3 values it at 98.
  - Agent 4 values it at 34.
  - **Allocate item 4 to Agent 3** (highest).

- **Item 5:**
  - Agent 0 values it at 41.
  - Agent 1 values it at 9.
  - Agent 2 values it at 19.
  - Agent 3 values it at 11.
  - Agent 4 values it at 12.
  - **Allocate item 5 to Agent 0** (highest).

### Final Allocation
Based on the above steps, we have the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
This allocation considers each agent's preferences while ensuring each item is allocated efficiently and no agent receives more items than others needlessly.
