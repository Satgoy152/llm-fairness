Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  97  98   0  36  95  16  74
1  56  13  42  34  24  75  68  17
2  87  16  44   2  38  57  16  76
3  77  62  83  49  28  69  19  39
4   5   2  59  22  66   7  77  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can use an algorithmic approach to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. One common method for fair division is the "round-robin" algorithm, where agents take turns selecting their most preferred items until all items are allocated. However, considering the complexity of envy-freeness and maximizing individual agent valuations, we might approach this problem using a combination of maximizing each agent's utility while ensuring that no agent feels significantly envious of another.

Here's a step-by-step method to achieve an allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:** Start by looking for the highest valuations by each agent for the items.
2. **Assign Items Iteratively:** In each round, assign the highest valued item available for an agent until all items are allocated.
3. **Ensure Envy-Freeness:** Ensure that the allocation minimizes envy by balancing the total value each agent receives.

After analyzing the given table, here is one potential allocation of items:

- **Agent 0** values item 2 highly (98) and item 1 (97).
- **Agent 1** values item 5 (75) and item 6 (68).
- **Agent 2** values item 0 (87) and item 7 (76).
- **Agent 3** values item 3 (49) and item 4 (28).
- **Agent 4** values item 6 (77) but that might be a conflict with Agent 1 who also values item 6 highly.

Considering all these, try to allocate the items to balance the overall distribution of values while keeping each agent's preferences in mind:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 7.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets items 4 and 6.

This allocation attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that the number of items per agent remains integer and all 8 items are allocated.
