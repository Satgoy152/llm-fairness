Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  68  66   6   7  94  31  26
1  71  14  48  99  75  39  68  69
2  87  97  80  52  73  22  91  72
3  16   1  50  90  68  65  91   5
4  68  73  68  16  90  33  45  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can apply a method that attempts to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value.

First, let's consider the total value for each agent and each item to identify potential allocations that maximize each agent's satisfaction.

### Total Valuation by Agent:
- Agent 0: 52 + 68 + 66 + 6 + 7 + 94 + 31 + 26 = 350
- Agent 1: 71 + 14 + 48 + 99 + 75 + 39 + 68 + 69 = 483
- Agent 2: 87 + 97 + 80 + 52 + 73 + 22 + 91 + 72 = 574
- Agent 3: 16 + 1 + 50 + 90 + 68 + 65 + 91 + 5 = 386
- Agent 4: 68 + 73 + 68 + 16 + 90 + 33 + 45 + 13 = 406

### Maximizing Value for Each Agent:
- **Agent 0** values item 5 the most (94).
- **Agent 1** values item 3 the most (99).
- **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (97).
- **Agent 3** values item 6 the most (91).
- **Agent 4** values item 4 the most (90).

Let's allocate these most-valued items first:

- Agent 0 gets item 5
- Agent 1 gets item 3
- Agent 2 gets item 1
- Agent 3 gets item 6
- Agent 4 gets item 4

### Remaining Items: 
0, 2, 7

### Allocate Remaining Items:
- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most (87).
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most (80).
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it the most (69).

Let's finalize the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [5]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 7]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 1, 2]
- **Agent 3**: [6]
- **Agent 4**: [4]

Thus, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
