Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  48  90   7  27  21  12  97
1  31   0  50  40  10  43  50  55
2  97  87  97  51  22   9  82  62
3  79  10  78  92  18  50  54  79
4  15  12  25  99  42  65  69  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. One simple approach to achieve a fair division that minimizes envy is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the agents' highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Below is a step-by-step approach to fairly allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their preferences.
2. Allocate the items using a greedy approach by assigning each item iteratively to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item by distributing the items as evenly as possible, using a round-robin distribution if necessary.

Let's execute this allocation process:

1. **Calculate total valuations:**
   - Agent 0: 5 + 48 + 90 + 7 + 27 + 21 + 12 + 97 = 307
   - Agent 1: 31 + 0 + 50 + 40 + 10 + 43 + 50 + 55 = 279
   - Agent 2: 97 + 87 + 97 + 51 + 22 + 9 + 82 + 62 = 507
   - Agent 3: 79 + 10 + 78 + 92 + 18 + 50 + 54 + 79 = 460
   - Agent 4: 15 + 12 + 25 + 99 + 42 + 65 + 69 + 74 = 401

2. **Allocate items based on highest individual valuations:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (97)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (87)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (90)
   - Item 3: Agent 4 (99)
   - Item 4: Agent 4 (42)
   - Item 5: Agent 4 (65)
   - Item 6: Agent 4 (69)
   - Item 7: Agent 0 (97)

3. **Adjust allocation to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items:**
   - Agent 2 has 2 items (0 and 1).
   - Agent 0 has 2 items (2 and 7).
   - Agent 4 has 4 items (3, 4, 5, and 6).
   - Agent 1 and Agent 3 currently have no items, so we need to reallocate to ensure both get at least one item.

4. **Reallocate some items to ensure fairness and integer allocations:**
   - Transfer item 1 from Agent 2 to Agent 1.
   - Transfer item 4 from Agent 4 to Agent 3.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Item [0]
- Agent 3: Item [4]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 5, 6]

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
