Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  73   2  62  62  39  28  65
1  11  65  16  72  29  81  52  97
2  17  33  83  66  23   8  83  40
3  91  73  77  81  91  12  24  24
4  63  13  40   6   5  34  49  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair or at least not worse than any other agent's allocation. We will attempt to distribute the items in such a way that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 0, 1, 3, 4, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 and item 7 very highly.
3. **Agent 2** values items 2 and 6 highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3, 0, and 4 highly.
5. **Agent 4** has a moderate spread of valuations but does not have a particularly high valuation for any item compared to others.

A possible allocation can be as follows:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 3, as they value it significantly (91).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (73).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as they value it very highly (83).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they value it highly (72).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as they value it significantly (91).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as they value it very highly (81).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as they value it highly (83).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (65).

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items that they value relatively highly compared to others, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": []
}
```

This ensures that all 8 items are allocated and the allocations try to minimize envy among the agents.
