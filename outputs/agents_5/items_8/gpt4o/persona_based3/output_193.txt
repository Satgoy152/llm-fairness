Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  44  11  61  78  34  19  28
1  37  35  26   6  48  36   7  44
2  15  34  19  65  24  85  48  26
3  69  16  13  94  86  29  68  23
4  30  39  34   3  98  16   3  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness in mind, we can use a method like the "Adjusted Winner Procedure" or "Round Robin" allocation. Here, I will use a simple heuristic approach to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, while aiming to minimize envy among agents.

Here's an approach to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents iteratively by ensuring each selection gives the highest marginal increase in value to the agent while considering fairness.
3. Continue allocating until all items are distributed, ensuring no agent is left without items if possible.

Now, let's begin the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuations for each agent:
   - Agent 0: 280
   - Agent 1: 239
   - Agent 2: 316
   - Agent 3: 398
   - Agent 4: 271

2. Sort items by the highest valuation each agent has for them. Allocate the item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

3. Implement the allocation:

   - Agent 0 values item 4 the most, thus gets item 4.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the most, thus gets item 7.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most, thus gets item 5.
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most, thus gets item 3.
   - Agent 4 values item 4 the most but it's taken, next highest is item 0, thus gets item 0.
   - Agent 3 values item 6 the most after item 3, thus gets item 6.
   - Agent 0 values item 1 the most after item 4, thus gets item 1.
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the most after item 7, thus gets item 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to maximize their total valuation, making it as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent their highest remaining valued item in turns, providing a fair distribution.
