Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  25  45  35  55   5  90  66
1  88  91  44  98  41  64  99  10
2  96   4  83  99  21  21  90  97
3  16  22  12  19  79  60  36  82
4  66  36  26  51  17  20  67  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent's allocation is envy-free as much as possible. This means each agent should feel they received the best subset of items given their valuations. Given the constraints and the number of items and agents, each agent will receive at least one item since there are 5 agents and 8 items.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 6 (90) and item 7 (66).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 3 (98) and 6 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 3 (99) and 0 (96).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 4 (79) and 7 (82).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 0 (66) and 6 (67).

Now, let's allocate items while minimizing envy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 6.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 7.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 4.

We still have 3 items left to allocate: 1, 2, and 5. Let's consider the remaining values:

- **Agent 1**: Values for items 1 (91) and 5 (64).
- **Agent 2**: Values for items 2 (83) and 5 (21).
- **Agent 4**: Value for item 1 (36), 2 (26), and 5 (20).

Considering the remaining items and the agents' valuations:

- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 2.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 5.

Now, the allocation of items by agents is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and items are allocated based on maximizing individual valuations, hence minimizing envy.
