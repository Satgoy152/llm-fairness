Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  77  43  11  93  82  78  71
1  80  66  90  82  11  19  73  99
2  20   5  56  72  47   7  55  17
3  10  41  20  48   8  87  34  36
4  77  59  54  73  40  24  29  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to minimize envy among agents. One such method is the Envy-Free allocation, where each agent gets at least their proportional share of the total value of items, if possible.

We will proceed by attempting to allocate items to maximize the minimum satisfaction or value of each agent, ensuring that all items are allocated and no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

Let's calculate each agent's total valuation for all items:

1. Agent 0: 76 + 77 + 43 + 11 + 93 + 82 + 78 + 71 = 531
2. Agent 1: 80 + 66 + 90 + 82 + 11 + 19 + 73 + 99 = 520
3. Agent 2: 20 + 5 + 56 + 72 + 47 + 7 + 55 + 17 = 279
4. Agent 3: 10 + 41 + 20 + 48 + 8 + 87 + 34 + 36 = 284
5. Agent 4: 77 + 59 + 54 + 73 + 40 + 24 + 29 + 38 = 394

Based on these valuations, we will allocate items to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible.

A possible allocation strategy:

- Assign each agent the item with the highest value according to their preferences, then iterate to assign remaining items considering the next highest value for each agent.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [4, 5] (Values: 93, 82)
- Agent 1: Items [2, 7] (Values: 90, 99)
- Agent 2: Items [3] (Values: 72)
- Agent 3: Items [6] (Values: 34)
- Agent 4: Items [0, 1] (Values: 77, 59)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations, minimizing potential envy among agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
