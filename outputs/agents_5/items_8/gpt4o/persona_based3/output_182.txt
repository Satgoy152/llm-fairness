Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  30  54  12  84   4  52  91
1   1  84  68  51  32  22  66   6
2  73  47  22  27  82   2  89  63
3  79  28  23  39  93  82  96  38
4   8  35  26  52  46  57  43  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, meaning that no agent prefers the bundle of items received by another agent over their own bundle. Given that there's one more item than the number of agents, each agent should ideally receive 1 or 2 items to ensure that all 8 items are distributed.

A common approach in fair division is the "Envy-Free up to One Good" (EF1) allocation, where each agent may envy another agent's allocation, but this envy can be eliminated by removing at most one item from the other agent's bundle. Let's attempt an allocation that strives for this condition:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for item 7. 
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 6.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 7, but since agent 0 also values it highly, let's consider another option.

With these preferences in mind, here's a potential allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [7] (high value on item 7)
- **Agent 1**: [1] (high value on item 1)
- **Agent 2**: [6, 2] (high value on item 6 and moderate value on item 2)
- **Agent 3**: [4, 3] (high value on item 4 and moderate value on item 3)
- **Agent 4**: [5, 0] (moderate values on items 5 and 0)

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item they highly value, reducing potential envy.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integral number of items.
