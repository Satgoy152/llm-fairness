Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  62  59  99  43  40  28  52
1  88  61  53  47  39  88  94  84
2  65  25  78   0  29   3  19  30
3  49  42   4  16  56  32   9  81
4  85  74  60  25  48  93  49  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents such that the distribution is envy-free, we must consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to allocate all 8 items in a manner that minimizes envy.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values item 3 (99) and item 1 (62). Allocating these to Agent 0 would maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 6 (94) the most. Allocating item 6 would satisfy them greatly. Also, item 0 (88) has a high value for them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 (78) the most. Allocating item 2 would satisfy them.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 7 (81) the most. Allocating item 7 would satisfy them.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 5 (93) the most. Allocating item 5 would satisfy them. Additionally, item 4 (48) could be allocated as it ensures all items are distributed.

This allocation ensures each agent receives one or two items, and the distribution is based on maximizing their individual valuations.

The allocations can be represented in the JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 4]
}
```
