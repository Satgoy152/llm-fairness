Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  86   4  97  87  54  73   9
1  85  39  92  59  59  90  48  70
2  78  20  86  82  85  92  93  91
3  47  83  97   1  58  34   3  21
4  89  82  95  89   9  51   7  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents based on their valuations, we will aim for an envy-free or approximately envy-free distribution. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Given the agents and their valuations, we can use a method like the "maximum envy-free allocation" or "approximate envy-freeness" while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (as there are 8 items and 5 agents).

Let's proceed with an allocation plan:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 3 the highest (97).
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the highest (92).
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 the highest (93).
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 the highest (97), but since it's already allocated, the next highest is item 1 (83).
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 2 the highest (95), but since it's already allocated, the next highest is item 0 (89).

With the highest value items allocated, let's allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution:

- **Agent 0**: After item 3, the next highest is item 4 (87).
- **Agent 1**: After item 2, the next highest is item 5 (90).
- **Agent 2**: After item 6, the next highest is item 5 (92), but since it's already allocated, item 7 (91).
- **Agent 4**: After item 0, the next highest are items 3 and 4, but since they are allocated, item 5 (51).

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [6, 7]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 4: Item [0]

This is a fair allocation with each agent receiving at least one item, and it respects the preference for higher-valued items as much as possible. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```
