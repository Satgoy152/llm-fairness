Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  43  16  16  48  77  37  62
1   0   5  40  60  45  79  12  59
2  33  39  87  50  42  50  99  42
3  19  33  87  78  43  65  10  43
4  71  10  86  37   1  70  19  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. A common approach in such problems is to try to maximize the minimum satisfaction among all agents or to use approximate algorithms to ensure a fair distribution. Given this problem, let's attempt an allocation that considers each agent's preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for item 5 (77) and item 7 (62).
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 5 (79) and 3 (60).
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 6 (99) and 2 (87).
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 2 (87) and 3 (78).
5. **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 0 (71) and 2 (86).

Given these observations, an allocation attempt could be:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items [5, 7] to Agent 0, as they have high valuations for these.
- **Agent 1**: Assign items [3] for its relatively high valuation.
- **Agent 2**: Assign items [6, 2], as these have the highest valuations.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item [1] to provide some value.
- **Agent 4**: Assign items [0, 4] as these are left and provide some value.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, and all items are fairly distributed among the agents.
