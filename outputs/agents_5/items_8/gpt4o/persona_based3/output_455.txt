Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86   2  35  60  60   1  91  30
1  57  94  23  96  59  24  94  55
2  72  63  78  56  30  46  26  54
3  42  21  66  17  96  15  32  85
4  41  92  93  36  85  30  89  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations. We will also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated.

Let's go through a possible allocation step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuations:** Identify the highest valued items for each agent to ensure that we start by allocating items that each agent values highly.

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Preferences:** 
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (91). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (96). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (78). Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (96). Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 4 values item 2 (93) the highest but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 1 (92). Assign item 1 to Agent 4.

3. **Continue Allocating Remaining Items:** Allocate remaining items by considering the second highest valuation for each agent as possible.
   - Agent 0: Remaining items are 0, 5, and 7. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (86) among these. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1: Remaining items are 5 and 7. Agent 1 values item 7 (55) higher than item 5 (24). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 and 3 have no remaining highest preference left, so we look at the next available items.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 since Agent 2 values item 5 (46) higher than Agent 3 (15).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 3.

4. **Final Allocation Check:** Ensure that all items are allocated and no agent is left without a fair number of items.

The allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the highest valuation preferences of each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated fairly.
