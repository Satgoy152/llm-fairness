Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58   3   1  66  52  69  48  43
1  60  43  21  25  79  42  56  29
2   7  48   0  25  12  27  21  62
3  89  78  64  28  44  44  43  62
4  73  53  38  56  93  45  46  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. This can be done using an algorithm such as the "Envy-Free Matching" or the "Round Robin" method, but given the small scale, I'll use a manual approach to ensure fairness based on the given valuations. 

Here's a possible fair allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 0 (89), so assign item 0 to them.
2. **Agent 4** highly values item 4 (93) and item 7 (93), so assign items 4 and 7 to them.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 5 (69), so assign item 5 to them.
4. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (43), so assign item 1 to them.
5. **Agent 2** highly values item 6 (62), so assign item 6 to them.
6. **Agent 1** also has a relatively high valuation for item 3 (25), so assign item 3 to them.
7. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 2 (1) compared to other agents, so assign item 2 to them.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one of the items they value highly, and the total of 8 items is distributed with minimal envy. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
