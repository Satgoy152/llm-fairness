Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  85  38  73  98  43  22  59
1  91  55  41  70   9  29  25  33
2  60  78   9  65  74  89  48  66
3  80  95  92  14  52  99  30  21
4  58  31  97  36  28  58  89  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own allocation based on their valuations.

Given the valuations and the requirement that each agent receives an integer number of items, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (99). Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (91), but since it's already taken, their next best is item 3 (70). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (89). Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (99), but since it's already taken, their next best is item 1 (95). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (97). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 3 more items.

6. **Remaining items**: 4, 6, 7.

Let's allocate the remaining items by evaluating where they would cause the least envy:

- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 highly (98). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Agent 4 values item 6 highly (89). Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 values item 7 highly (66). Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

This allocation tries to balance the values each agent receives, aiming to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation is designed to distribute the total valuation as evenly as possible, considering the constraints and aiming for an envy-free outcome.
