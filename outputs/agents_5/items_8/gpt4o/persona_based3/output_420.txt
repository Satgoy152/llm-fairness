Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  17  62   1  45   4  43  18
1  74  88  89  34  90  98  27  59
2  16  63  65  33  58  82  37  28
3  54   1  89  78  66  54   1  78
4  62  13   3   6  92  46  71  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an approach like the "round-robin" method or "maximum envy-free" allocation. Given the valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Here's one way to allocate the items using a heuristic approach:

1. Identify the items each agent values the most and distribute them accordingly, while ensuring no agent feels envious of another's allocation.
2. Adjust allocations to make sure each agent has a fair share based on their preferences.

Following these steps, we can derive an allocation that attempts to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints:

- Allocate item 5 to agent 1, as they value it the most.
- Allocate item 2 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 3, as they value it the most.
- Allocate item 4 to agent 4, as they value it the most.
- Allocate item 0 to agent 0, as they have the highest valuation for it.
- Allocate item 7 to agent 3, as they have a high valuation for it and already have item 3.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 2, as they have a relatively high valuation for it.
- Allocate item 6 to agent 0, as they have a relatively high valuation for it.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, thus aiming to minimize envy among the agents.
