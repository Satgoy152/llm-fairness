Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  39  31   1  21  13  61  89
1  93  29  32  85  54  54  35  85
2  26  43   6   7  78  82  87  40
3   0  41  22   8  57  35  94  86
4  57  36  72  27  88  73  29  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation while ensuring envy-freeness, where possible. Envy-freeness means no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own.

Given the matrix with agents' valuations for each item, the goal is to allocate all 8 items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the allocation is fair.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest at 89, which is also the highest valuation for item 7 among all agents.
- Agent 1 values items 0 and 3 the highest at 93 and 85 respectively.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest at 87.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest, but since it is already allocated to agent 2, we will consider the next highest valuation, which is item 7, but that is allocated to agent 0, so we consider item 3 at 8.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest at 88.

The allocations based on these considerations would be:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [1, 2, 4]

Let's verify the allocations:

1. Agent 0 gets item 7, which they value the highest.
2. Agent 1 gets items 0 and 3, both of which are among their highest valuations.
3. Agent 2 gets item 6, which they value the highest.
4. Agent 3 gets item 5, the next highest available item for them.
5. Agent 4 gets items 1, 2, and 4, which are among their higher valuations.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the JSON format of these allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
