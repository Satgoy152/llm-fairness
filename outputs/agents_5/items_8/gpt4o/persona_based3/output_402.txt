Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  57  41  71  78  45  81  10
1  57   5  95  58  53  18  53   2
2  15  73  18  20  98  15  47  29
3  43  81   8   8  89  55  18  81
4  29  44  97  26   0  13  28   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations is often challenging, especially when the number of items and agents don't match perfectly. Here, we'll aim for a fair division that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item, while ensuring that each agent receives approximately equal total value. We'll also ensure that all items are allocated.

### Valuation Summary:

- Agent 0: Highest values for items are 81 (item 6) and 78 (item 4).
- Agent 1: Highest values for items are 95 (item 2) and 57 (item 0).
- Agent 2: Highest values for items are 98 (item 4) and 73 (item 1).
- Agent 3: Highest values for items are 89 (item 4) and 81 (item 1).
- Agent 4: Highest values for items are 97 (item 2) and 44 (item 1).

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4, but it's already taken. Assign item 1, the next highest, to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 2, but it's already taken. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6. We need to allocate items 3, 5, and 7.

6. Assign item 3 to Agent 0, as they have a relatively high value for it.
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as they have a moderate value for it.
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 4, as it is the remaining item and they can accept it with minimal envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation tries to minimize envy by giving each agent at least one of their more highly valued items while ensuring all items are distributed.
