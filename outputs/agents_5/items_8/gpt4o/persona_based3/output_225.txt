Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  51  35  33  41  72   0   0
1  57  79  31  99   3  60  24  64
2  51  46  18  31  22   8  39   7
3  57  16  61  30   8  11  92  24
4   3  65  21  57  61  65  35  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation of the items they receive.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively lower valuations, with item 6 being the highest.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the most.
5. **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 1, 4, and 5.

Given these observations, we can assign items based on maximizing the valuations for each agent while attempting to minimize envy. A possible fair allocation can be:

- **Agent 0** gets items [0, 5], maximizing their valuation.
- **Agent 1** gets item [3], maximizing their valuation for that item.
- **Agent 2** gets item [2], as they have relatively low valuations.
- **Agent 3** gets item [6], which they highly value.
- **Agent 4** gets items [1, 4, 7], maximizing their valuation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 4, 7]
}
```
