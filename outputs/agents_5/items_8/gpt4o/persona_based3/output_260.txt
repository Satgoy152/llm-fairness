Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  78  65  58  65  19  66  32
1  65  21  93  14  93  95   1  46
2  71  81  67  13  11  28  51  75
3  45  53  57  40  45  34  48  21
4  71  53  22  99   7  53   1  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents and ensure envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations.

Here is a possible fair allocation using a greedy algorithm approach, where we try to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. **Agent 0**: Based on the values, assign items they value highly. Agent 0 values item 1 highly (78), so assign item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 2 and 4 (both valued at 93). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: For Agent 2, item 1 has already been allocated. The next highest valued item is 0 (71). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 highly, but it's already taken. Item 3 is their next highest valuation (40). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 3 highly, but it's already taken. The next best option is item 7 (65). Assign item 7 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items.

6. **Review remaining items**: Items 4, 5, and 6 are left. We allocate them based on remaining highest values across agents:

    - **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the highest (93), but Agent 1 already has item 2. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as they value it second highest (65).
    
    - **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the highest (95). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
    
    - **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the highest (66). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

After allocation, all 8 items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the preferences while distributing the items fairly.
