Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  65  27  53  41  77  71  14
1  14  22  18  68  71   2  40  79
2  84  36  29   8  25  17  88  75
3  41  39  87  50  25  71  69  15
4  59  86  81   9  30  79  83  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while taking into consideration their valuations, we can use a method that aims for an envy-free allocation as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's approach this problem by trying to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible. Here's a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 5 the highest (77), so we could allocate this item to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 7 the highest (79), so let's allocate item 7 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (84), so we'll allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (87), so let's allocate item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (86), so item 1 should go to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 3 more items while keeping the distribution fair:

6. **Agent 0**: Let's also give agent 0 item 3 (valued at 53), as it's the next highest valuation for agent 0.
7. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 should receive item 6 because it's their next highest valuation (83).
8. **Agent 3**: Finally, allocate item 4 to agent 3, as it's a reasonable choice given the remaining items.

This allocation gives each agent a high-value item based on their preferences while distributing the remaining items to balance the total valuations fairly across the agents.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
