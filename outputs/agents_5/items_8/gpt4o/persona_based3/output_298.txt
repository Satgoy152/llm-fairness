Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  35   3  90  98  69  84  68
1  30  21  63  84  96  21   4   5
2  11  48  81   8  61  10  20   2
3  60  62  29  94   0  93  38   2
4  95  74  39  43  86  52  31  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the adjusted winner procedure or the envy-free up to one good (EF1) criterion. However, given the constraints of integer allocations and the need for practical distribution, I'll use a heuristic method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of items.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items:

### Valuations Table:
```
    Items
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  35   3  90  98  69  84  68
1  30  21  63  84  96  21   4   5
2  11  48  81   8  61  10  20   2
3  60  62  29  94   0  93  38   2
4  95  74  39  43  86  52  31  78
```

### Suggested Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for items 4 (98) and 3 (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 2 (63) and 4 (96).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 2 (81).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 3 (94) and 5 (93).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 0 (95) and 1 (74).

#### Allocation Steps:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
5. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
7. Allocate item 7 to Agent 4.
8. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

This allocation aims to respect the highest valuations while attempting to keep a balance.

### Final Allocation JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly, while also considering a fair distribution among all agents. The allocations are made trying to balance the total value received by each agent as best as possible under the given constraints.
