Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  13  29  22  51  81   9  32
1  39  36  48  80  95  58  93  30
2  69  67  65  47  30  87  29   7
3  18  32  83  58   4  55  37  68
4  84  32  15  67  15  74  27  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to balance the valuations each agent has for the items they receive. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and only the items listed can be allocated, we must ensure that the total sum of valuations for each agent's bundle is as balanced as possible. 

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Values are: [58, 13, 29, 22, 51, 81, 9, 32]  
   - High value: Item 5

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Values are: [39, 36, 48, 80, 95, 58, 93, 30]  
   - High values: Item 4, Item 6

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Values are: [69, 67, 65, 47, 30, 87, 29, 7]  
   - High value: Item 5

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Values are: [18, 32, 83, 58, 4, 55, 37, 68]  
   - High value: Item 2

5. **Agent 4**:  
   - Values are: [84, 32, 15, 67, 15, 74, 27, 21]  
   - High value: Item 0

Based on these observations, I will attempt to distribute the items to achieve a fair and envy-free allocation:

- Allocate high-value items to the agents who value them the most.
- Balance the total valuation for each agent.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 5 (highest value for agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 6 (highest values for agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: Item 0 (high value for agent 2)
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 7 (high value for agent 3)
- **Agent 4**: Items 1, 3 (balance between high values for agent 4)

This allocation should balance the total valuations each agent receives and reduce envy among agents.

### Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their preferences, striving for balance and minimizing envy.
