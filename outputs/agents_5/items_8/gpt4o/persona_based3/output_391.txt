Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  55  55  28  75  56  61  17
1  28  80  88  17  52  28  12   7
2  67  94  74  71  87  59  47  58
3  45   3  85  26  91   0  50  30
4  37  33  16  77  96  40  20  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives items such that no agent prefers another's allocation over their own, given their valuations. The challenge is to distribute the 8 items across the 5 agents.

Given the valuations, we can use a heuristic approach to minimize envy by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations until all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuation order: [0, 4, 6, 5, 1, 2, 3, 7]
2. **Agent 1**: Valuation order: [2, 1, 4, 0, 5, 3, 6, 7]
3. **Agent 2**: Valuation order: [1, 4, 0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 6]
4. **Agent 3**: Valuation order: [4, 2, 0, 6, 3, 7, 1, 5]
5. **Agent 4**: Valuation order: [4, 3, 7, 0, 5, 1, 6, 2]

By examining these orders, we can try an allocation strategy where we start from the top preferences and distribute items until all are allocated.

Let's attempt to allocate:

- **Agent 0** receives item 0 (highest preference not yet allocated)
- **Agent 1** receives item 2
- **Agent 2** receives item 1
- **Agent 3** receives item 4
- **Agent 4** receives item 3

Continuing this process to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0** receives another item, item 5 (next highest preference)
- **Agent 1** receives item 6
- **Agent 4** receives item 7

This allocation will ensure all items are distributed and try to match preferences, reducing potential envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has at least one item. It attempts to minimize envy by aligning with each agent's preferences as closely as possible, given the constraints.
