Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  15  93  87  25  49  13  65
1  19  77  12  89  48  91  90  95
2  47   0  57  13  53  32  72  45
3  27  93  16  21  53  58  33  65
4  42   2  48  65  18  60  45  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own. This is a complex problem, but we can try to distribute the items in a way that seems fair based on the given valuations. 

Let's examine the valuations and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 2 (93) and item 3 (87), so we should consider allocating these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 7 (95) and item 5 (91), suggesting we allocate these to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 (72) the most, so we should allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 1 (93), so we can allocate this item to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 5 (60) among the items left, but since item 5 is already allocated, we can allocate item 0 (42) to Agent 4.

Now we distribute the remaining items:

- Items 0, 4 remain unallocated. We'll assign item 0 to Agent 3 and item 4 to Agent 4 to balance the allocations.

Final allocation based on the above considerations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the agents' preferences while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, except for Agent 2, who receives their highest valued item. The allocation is an attempt to minimize envy under the constraint of integer allocation.
