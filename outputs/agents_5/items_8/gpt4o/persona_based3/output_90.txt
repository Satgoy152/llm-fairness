Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22   8  18  53  90   7  86  86
1  95  25  12  30  66  12  29   6
2  64  54   6  35  32   8  75  53
3  61  85  66  22  59  36  93  70
4  31  76  75   0  88  69  35  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we'll use a simple approach that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. This can be complex given the nature of the valuations and the need to balance fairness, but we'll attempt a reasonable distribution.

Here's a proposed allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Look for items that have significantly higher valuations for specific agents compared to others.
2. **Allocate Unique High-Value Items**: Assign these high-value items first to their respective agents.
3. **Distribute Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items considering the best possible fit to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** has a high value for item 4.
- **Agent 1** values item 0 the most.
- **Agent 2** values item 6 highly.
- **Agent 3** has high value for item 3.
- **Agent 4** highly values items 1 and 5.

Given these observations, let's make the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Item [4]
- **Agent 1**: Item [0]
- **Agent 2**: Item [6]
- **Agent 3**: Item [3]
- **Agent 4**: Items [1, 5]

Now, we have items 2 and 7 remaining. We need to allocate these to agents to maintain balance. Let's look at the remaining valuations:

- **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it highly.
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 and Agent 3 value it equally at 86, but Agent 3 values item 7 the highest among unallocated items.

Thus, final allocations can be:

- **Agent 0**: [4]
- **Agent 1**: [0]
- **Agent 2**: [6]
- **Agent 3**: [3, 2, 7]
- **Agent 4**: [1, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and the distribution seeks to maximize the satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 2, 7],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
