Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  11  16  92  24  43  32  98
1  44   4  47  20   9  76  72  53
2  93  17  16   1  66  64  78  77
3  59  81  45  83  27  78  57  95
4  40   4  26  54  94  95  99  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which ensures that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own given their valuations. Here, we have 8 items and 5 agents, so each agent will receive either 1 or 2 items.

Let's first calculate the total valuation of each agent for all items to get an overall sense of their preferences:

- Agent 0: \(79 + 11 + 16 + 92 + 24 + 43 + 32 + 98 = 395\)
- Agent 1: \(44 + 4 + 47 + 20 + 9 + 76 + 72 + 53 = 325\)
- Agent 2: \(93 + 17 + 16 + 1 + 66 + 64 + 78 + 77 = 412\)
- Agent 3: \(59 + 81 + 45 + 83 + 27 + 78 + 57 + 95 = 525\)
- Agent 4: \(40 + 4 + 26 + 54 + 94 + 95 + 99 + 12 = 424\)

Next, let's try to allocate items to agents by considering their highest valued items to ensure each agent gets items they value the most.

1. **Agent 0** values item 7 the highest (98). Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest (76). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest (93). Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 the highest, but it's already taken. Next best is item 3 (83). Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 the highest (99). Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, 3 items are left unallocated: items 1, 2, and 4. Let's allocate these remaining items by considering the next highest values for each agent, ensuring we maintain fairness by giving each agent at least one item:

6. **Agent 0** already has item 7, valued at 98. Next, value of item 3 is 92, but it's taken. Now, item 0 valued at 79 is taken. Thus, allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1** has item 5, valued at 76. Their next highest is item 6 (72), but it's taken. Their next available is item 2 (47). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
8. **Agent 2** has item 0, valued at 93. Their next highest available item is 1 (17). Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

After these allocations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [7, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 3: Item [3]
- Agent 4: Item [6]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation tries to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6]
}
```
