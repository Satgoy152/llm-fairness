Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  30  99  62  37  71  98  77
1  30  92  48  80  34  68  57  48
2  19  17  87  47  68  88  60  62
3  97   9  97  81  99  74  29  92
4  35   7  32  98  51  87  82  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use an algorithm that considers the preferences of each agent and ensures that the allocation is as balanced as possible. Given the table of values, we can apply a simple round-robin or a similar greedy allocation strategy to achieve this.

Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Compile the Preferences:**
   - Each agent has a preference list based on their valuation of the items.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - We will allocate items one by one, trying to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that no agent gets too many items compared to others.

3. **Ensure Fairness:**
   - We aim to allocate items such that each agent receives a fair share and no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

4. **Check and Adjust:**
   - After the initial allocation, we'll verify if any adjustments are necessary to improve fairness.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0** highest values: [2, 6, 0]
- **Agent 1** highest values: [1, 3]
- **Agent 2** highest values: [5, 4]
- **Agent 3** highest values: [4, 3, 0, 7]
- **Agent 4** highest values: [3, 5]

Based on this, we perform the allocation:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 2).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 6).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (second highest value for item 0, after Agent 0).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 1).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (highest value for item 3).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 5).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value for item 4).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (highest value for item 7).

Finally, the allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4, 7],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the distribution based on each agent's preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.
