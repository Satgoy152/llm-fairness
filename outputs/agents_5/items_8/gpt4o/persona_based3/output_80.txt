Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  82  27  22  31  17  63  60
1  41  28  93  45  29  30  56  92
2  17  92  52  59  68  12  30   2
3  14  47  28  60  31  59  77  80
4  46  10  51  16   6  58  69  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, given their own valuations.

One way to achieve an envy-free allocation is to use the method of "max-min fair allocation," which attempts to maximize the minimum satisfaction across all agents. However, given the constraint of discrete allocation, perfect envy-freeness may not always be possible, but we can strive to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for item 6.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (4, 5, 7) based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction without causing significant envy:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4 (value 31)
- **Agent 1**: Item 7 (value 92)
- **Agent 3**: Item 5 (value 59)

This allocation attempts to balance the value each agent receives, given their highest preferences, while distributing the remaining items to minimize potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [6]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
