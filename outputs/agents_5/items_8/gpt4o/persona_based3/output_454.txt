Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  22  53  50  30   0  96  64
1  85  35  53  93  93  85  30  93
2   3  32  83  79  96   1  85  16
3   2  72  64  98  43  51  90  37
4  41  58  21  88  30  26  46   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents based on their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, meaning that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity of achieving complete envy-freeness in many cases, we try to minimize envy while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (or as close to it as possible given the constraint of having 8 items and 5 agents).

Let's attempt an allocation that considers each agent's highest-valued items first:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 6 (96) and 7 (64).
2. **Agent 1** values items 3 (93) and 7 (93) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 (96) and item 2 (83) highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 (98) the most, and also item 6 (90).
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 (88) and item 1 (58) highly.

Let's start by allocating the highest-valued items to minimize potential envy:

- Allocate item 6 to **Agent 0** (value: 96).
- Allocate item 3 to **Agent 1** (value: 93).
- Allocate item 4 to **Agent 2** (value: 96).
- Allocate item 7 to **Agent 3** (value: 37).
- Allocate item 1 to **Agent 4** (value: 58).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (0, 2, 5) to balance preferences:

- Allocate item 2 to **Agent 2** (value: 83) since it is their second-highest valued item.
- Allocate item 0 to **Agent 1** (value: 85), which is the highest remaining value for them.
- Allocate item 5 to **Agent 3** (value: 51), adding to their allocation and minimizing any potential envy.

This allocation results in:

- **Agent 0**: [6]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 3]
- **Agent 2**: [2, 4]
- **Agent 3**: [5, 7]
- **Agent 4**: [1]

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and we attempt to minimize envy by satisfying high-valued preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [1]
}
```
