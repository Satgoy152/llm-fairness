Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  34  44  21  29  97  37   0
1  77  26  78  52  16  36  41  85
2  51  75  25  75   0   3  10  35
3  38  78  31   2  63   9  69   2
4  48  93  35  30  62  66  45  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. An allocation is envy-free if every agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation.

Given the valuations matrix, a simple approach is to use a greedy method that iteratively assigns items to the agent who values them the most among the remaining unassigned items. This heuristic doesn't guarantee complete envy-freeness but can provide a reasonable allocation.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (77)
   - Assign to Agent 1

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 4 (93)
   - Assign to Agent 4

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (78)
   - Assign to Agent 1

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (75)
   - Assign to Agent 2

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (63)
   - Assign to Agent 3

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (97)
   - Assign to Agent 0

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (69)
   - Assign to Agent 3

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (85)
   - Assign to Agent 1

Now, let's verify the allocations and ensure that exactly 8 items have been assigned:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 7]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [4, 6]
- Agent 4: [1]

This allocation assigns all 8 items. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 2, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
