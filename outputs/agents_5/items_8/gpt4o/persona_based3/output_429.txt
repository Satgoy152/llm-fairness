Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  34  32  69  18  11  46  93
1  55  27  18  56  27  90  93  45
2  35  36  69  85  97  82  14  25
3  36  17  73  78  36  72  55  52
4  68  27  72  60  61  73  25  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the preferences of each agent based on their valuations. Ideally, each agent should receive items such that, given their valuations, they do not prefer anyone else's bundle over their own.

Given the valuations provided, let's try to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 7 (93), 3 (69)
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: 6 (93), 5 (90)
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: 4 (97), 3 (85)
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: 3 (78), 2 (73)
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value items: 7 (83), 5 (73)
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** also values item 0 (36) and item 1 (34) highly.
  - Assign items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.

- **Agent 3** values item 2 (73) highly and has already received one of their preferred items.
  - Assign item 2 to Agent 3.

- **Agent 4** has item 7 as their highest preference not yet allocated.
  - Assign item 7 to Agent 4.

Finally, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while considering agents' preferences.
