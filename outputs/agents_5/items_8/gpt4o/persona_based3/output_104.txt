Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  95  33  15   8  32   2  25
1  45  86  69  99   8  66   7  42
2   5  22   3  61  10  73  21   7
3  72  97  78  14  55  43   2  37
4  88  31  27  46  91  35  97  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the concept of envy-freeness as much as possible. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own based on their valuations. Given the table of valuations, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's consider the total valuations each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0 values: 39 + 95 + 33 + 15 + 8 + 32 + 2 + 25 = 249
- Agent 1 values: 45 + 86 + 69 + 99 + 8 + 66 + 7 + 42 = 422
- Agent 2 values: 5 + 22 + 3 + 61 + 10 + 73 + 21 + 7 = 202
- Agent 3 values: 72 + 97 + 78 + 14 + 55 + 43 + 2 + 37 = 398
- Agent 4 values: 88 + 31 + 27 + 46 + 91 + 35 + 97 + 52 = 467

To achieve a fair distribution, we'll attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring no agent is envious of another's allocation. We'll use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on their highest relative value for each item, ensuring all items are allocated.

### Allocation Plan

1. **Agent 4**: Given the highest total valuation, Agent 4 will start with the item they value the most.
    - Allocating items [4, 6] to Agent 4 (valuations: 91, 97).

2. **Agent 1**: Next, allocate items to the agent with the second-highest total valuation.
    - Allocating items [3] to Agent 1 (valuation: 99).

3. **Agent 3**: Allocate items to Agent 3, focusing on their highest relative values.
    - Allocating items [1] to Agent 3 (valuation: 97).

4. **Agent 0**: Now, allocate items to Agent 0.
    - Allocating items [0] to Agent 0 (valuation: 39).

5. **Agent 2**: Finally, allocate items to Agent 2.
    - Allocating items [5, 7, 2] to Agent 2 (valuations: 73, 7, 3).

### Resulting Allocations

Following this allocation strategy, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 7, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures that all 8 items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items, aiming for a distribution that reduces potential envy among agents based on their valuations.
