Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  86  30  46  17  13  29  57
1  82   1  54   3  73  37  59  26
2  88  83  26   8  42  63  34  86
3  67  32  61  29  94  60   7  95
4  61  35  86  89  46  84  54  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use an approach that attempts to minimize envy by assigning items based on the agents' preferences. We will use the valuations given in the table to guide our allocation.

One way to approach this is to allocate the items iteratively by selecting the item-agent pair with the highest valuation that has not been assigned yet. This approach may not guarantee perfect envy-freeness, but it will give a reasonable starting point based on the agents' preferences.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most with a valuation of 88.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

2. **Agent 3** values item 7 the most with a valuation of 95.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 3.

3. **Agent 3** values item 4 next with a valuation of 94.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3.

4. **Agent 0** values item 1 highly with a valuation of 86.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

5. **Agent 4** values item 2 with a high valuation of 86.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

6. **Agent 4** values item 3 with a valuation of 89.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

7. **Agent 2** values item 5 highly with a valuation of 63.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

8. **Agent 2** values item 6 with a valuation of 34.
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 5, 6],
    "3": [7, 4],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the agents' preferences based on their valuations. Note that Agent 1 ends up with no items in this allocation. This is a simple allocation strategy and may not fully satisfy all criteria of fair division, such as perfect envy-freeness, but it does respect individual preferences as much as possible given the constraints.
