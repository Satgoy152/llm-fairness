Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  92  31  27  83   2  80  35
1  94  75  21  87  93  24   6  88
2  58  54  77  53  15  82  77  19
3  95  84  15  92  38  25  56  14
4  16  80  74  29  56  78  29  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation where each agent receives a set of items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their individual valuations. In this case, we have 5 agents and 8 items. Since 8 is not evenly divisible by 5, some agents will receive one more item than others. The goal is to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy.

Here is one potential allocation:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they received all items, and use this to guide distribution by prioritizing high-value items for agents who value them most.
2. Distribute items iteratively, ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible based on the agents' valuations.

After considering the valuation matrix, a fair allocation could look like this:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5] (valuations: 92, 2)
- Agent 1: Items [0, 4] (valuations: 94, 93)
- Agent 2: Items [2, 6] (valuations: 77, 77)
- Agent 3: Items [3] (valuation: 92)
- Agent 4: Items [7] (valuation: 16)

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is reasonable and no agent significantly envies another. It's important to note that achieving perfect envy-freeness is very challenging with a discrete and small number of items, but this allocation strives to minimize potential envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7]
}
```
