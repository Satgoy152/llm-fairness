Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  62  22  37  81  56  64  65
1  41  28  62  15  30  35  24  54
2  17  90  55  15   9  29  71  78
3  97  40  90   4  99  50  55  15
4  48  21  86  42  65  44  27  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while attempting to achieve envy-freeness, if possible. Given there are 8 items and 5 agents, each agent should receive approximately 1 to 2 items.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 4 (81) and 0 (75).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 2 (62) and item 7 (54).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 1 (90) and item 7 (78).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 4 (99) and item 0 (97).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 2 (86) and item 4 (65).

To begin, we will make allocations to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 as it has the highest value for them (99).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 as it has a high value (75).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2 as it has the highest value for them (90).
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 4 as it is highly valued by them (86).

With these allocations, the remaining items to allocate are 3, 5, 6, and 7:

- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2, as it is their second-highest valued item (78).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 as it is the next best choice for them (56).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0, as it is better suited for them (64).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1, as it leaves them with at least one item, albeit not highly valued (15).

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives items they value while distributing the items fairly.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

In this allocation, all items are distributed among the agents, maximizing each agent's individual valuations as much as possible.
