Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42   3  41  19  62  58  29  40
1  36  53  95  41  87  18  61  59
2  92  14  23  54  37  11  26  78
3  34  92  65  22  28  73  97  52
4  90  93  82  34  86  68  34  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "Envy-Free Matching" or "Adjusted Winner" approach. Here, we will try to maximize each agent's satisfaction relative to their valuations.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:**
   - Agent 0: Highest valuations are for item 4 (62) and item 5 (58).
   - Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 2 (95) and item 4 (87).
   - Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 0 (92) and item 7 (78).
   - Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 6 (97) and item 1 (92).
   - Agent 4: Highest valuation is for item 1 (93) and item 0 (90).

2. **Initial Allocation Attempt:**
   - Allocate items based on highest unique valuations first, then adjust to ensure each agent gets items. We try to satisfy the highest preferences while also making sure the allocation is balanced.

   - Agent 0: [5]
   - Agent 1: [2]
   - Agent 2: [0]
   - Agent 3: [6]
   - Agent 4: [1]

3. **Reassign Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 3, 4, 7.
   - Allocate remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and balancing the number of items.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [5, 4]
   - Agent 1: [2, 7]
   - Agent 2: [0]
   - Agent 3: [6]
   - Agent 4: [1, 3]

This allocation aims to ensure that no agent envies another based on their valuation of the items they received relative to the items they could have had. Each agent has received items that they value highly, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```
