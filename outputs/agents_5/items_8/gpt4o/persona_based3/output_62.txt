Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  33  62  54  16  13  25  28
1  20   6  51  11   6  28  79  57
2  88  61  90   2  74  64  96  92
3  74  91  11  84  10   7  77  62
4  88  51   8   6  98  21   4  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we aim to distribute the 8 items among the 5 agents in a way that is fair, ideally minimizing envy and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that we have 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

First, let's consider fairness and potential approaches:

1. **Envy-Freeness**: Ideally, each agent would prefer their own allocation over others, given their valuations.
2. **Proportionality**: Each agent should receive their fair share based on their total valuation of all items.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items:

- Agent 0: 89 + 33 + 62 + 54 + 16 + 13 + 25 + 28 = 320
- Agent 1: 20 + 6 + 51 + 11 + 6 + 28 + 79 + 57 = 258
- Agent 2: 88 + 61 + 90 + 2 + 74 + 64 + 96 + 92 = 567
- Agent 3: 74 + 91 + 11 + 84 + 10 + 7 + 77 + 62 = 416
- Agent 4: 88 + 51 + 8 + 6 + 98 + 21 + 4 + 87 = 363

Total valuation across all agents: 320 + 258 + 567 + 416 + 363 = 1924

Next, let's allocate items based on the valuations, aiming for each agent to get a proportion that closely reflects their total valuation:

1. **Agent 2 (567/1924 ≈ 29.5%)**: Has the highest valuation, so should get the most valued items.
2. **Agent 3 (416/1924 ≈ 21.6%)**: Second highest, should get second priority.
3. **Agent 4 (363/1924 ≈ 18.9%)**: Third highest.
4. **Agent 0 (320/1924 ≈ 16.6%)**: Fourth.
5. **Agent 1 (258/1924 ≈ 13.4%)**: Lowest, receives last choice.

Now, let's allocate the items based on the agents' preferences:

- Agent 2: Items [6, 2] (96, 90 - high-value items for Agent 2)
- Agent 3: Items [1, 3] (91, 84 - high-value items for Agent 3)
- Agent 4: Items [4, 7] (98, 87 - high-value items for Agent 4)
- Agent 0: Item [0] (89 - high-value item for Agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item [5] (28 - highest remaining value for Agent 1)

This allocation ensures that the agents with higher valuations receive more valuable items, and all items are distributed.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
