Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  64  31   6  19  25  55  55
1  86  94  53  78  95  76  23  77
2  30  57  97  87  95  14  59   7
3  58  40  60  55   6  41  81   5
4  97  17  64  39  25   3   5  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we should consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share, based on their own valuations. We'll aim to distribute the items such that no agent envies another's allocation more than their own.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Considerations:**
   - We have 8 items and 5 agents.
   - Each agent should get at least one item, except one agent who will get two items. 
   - Focus on giving each agent items they value highly.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
   - Adjust allocations to ensure that total number of items is 8 and that no agent envies another's allocation more than their own.

3. **Allocation Process:**
   - Agent 4 highly values item 0 (97), so allocate item 0 to agent 4.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 4 (95), so allocate item 4 to agent 1.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 2 (97), so allocate item 2 to agent 2.
   - Agent 3 highly values item 6 (81), so allocate item 6 to agent 3.
   - For remaining allocations, aim to minimize envy while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

4. **Final Allocation:**

After reviewing the valuations and attempting to minimize envy, here is one possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

Each agent has received items that they value, and the total number of items allocated is 8, as required. This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations.
