Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  17  77  84  50  63  47  16
1  90  26  70  29  69  49  40  75
2  94  99  83  63  55  10  32  85
3  54  22  36  16   2  40  74  71
4  76  96  24  74   0  97  64  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a solution where the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-freeness as possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent, given their own valuations.

First, let's determine a fair allocation by attempting to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest at 84. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest at 90. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest at 99. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 6 the highest at 74. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 the highest at 97. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

At this point, each agent has received one item that they value highly. Now, let's allocate the remaining items (2, 4, 7) to further balance the allocation:

6. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 at 77, which is the highest among the remaining items. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
7. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values item 4 at 69, which is the highest among the remaining items. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values item 7 at 85, which is the highest among the remaining items. Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

Now, let's present the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest preferences of each agent for the available items, aiming to achieve a fair distribution.
