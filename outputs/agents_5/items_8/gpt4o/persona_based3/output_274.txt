Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  71  76  80  96  38  36  21
1   7  29  69   2  37  97  59  47
2  69  58  36  61  98  87  79  30
3  29  33  56  52  63  66  74  55
4  26  13  42  79   3  53  96   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives items valued highly by them. This problem is a type of fair division problem, where we look for envy-free or nearly envy-free allocations.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
    0  74  71  76  80  96  38  36  21
    1   7  29  69   2  37  97  59  47
    2  69  58  36  61  98  87  79  30
    3  29  33  56  52  63  66  74  55
    4  26  13  42  79   3  53  96   4
```

Let's follow these steps to allocate the items:

1. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   Each agent should first be considered for the item they value the most, provided no conflict arises.

2. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   If multiple agents desire the same item the most, we need a tiebreaker strategy, which can be random or based on a secondary preference.

3. **Ensure Every Item is Allocated:**
   Ensure that each item is allocated and each agent has an equal opportunity to receive an item they value.

4. **Iterate and Adjust:**
   Adjust assignments iteratively to minimize envy among agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (96).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (97).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (98), but item 4 is already preferred by Agent 0. Agent 2's next highest valuation is item 5 (87), but it's taken by Agent 1, so they get item 6 (79).
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most (74), but item 6 is taken by Agent 2. Agent 3's next highest valuation is item 5 (66), but it's taken by Agent 1, so they get item 3 (52).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most (96), but it's taken by Agent 2. Agent 4's next highest valuation is item 3 (79), but it's taken by Agent 3, so they get item 5 (53).

Taking into account these valuations and resolving conflicts, here is a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 1, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one of their most-valued items, while also ensuring all items are allocated. The allocation may not be perfectly envy-free, but it attempts to balance the distribution based on the given valuations.
