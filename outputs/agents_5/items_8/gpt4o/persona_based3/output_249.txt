Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  74  90  11  98  78  99   5
1  66  73  32  77  33  25  52  74
2  97   7  16  63  19  89  42  35
3   5  51  34  38  73   9  70  59
4  20  55   3  33  83  12  15  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free division. This means every agent should feel they got at least as much value as any other agent based on their own valuation.

One potential approach to achieving this is to maximize each agent's minimum satisfaction, using methods like the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution or other fair division strategies. However, given the constraints, we'll use a heuristic approach to distribute the items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the highest with 97.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the highest with 74.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the highest with 90.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the highest with 77.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the highest with 98.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the highest with 89.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the highest with 99.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it the highest with 95.

Now let's balance the allocation to ensure each agent gets a fair share.

- Agent 0: [1, 2, 4]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0, 5]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [7, 6] 

Now, let's present the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations, while also ensuring all items are distributed.
