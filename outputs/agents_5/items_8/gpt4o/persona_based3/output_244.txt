Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  17  51  26  45  58  30  23
1   5  41  59  39   9  48  61  45
2  50  93  65   1  96  19   0  30
3  57  60  35  32  91  13   4  85
4  63  66  80  34  28  33  40  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that aims to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations. One approach is to use the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns selecting their most preferred item from the remaining items. Given the valuations, this approach will attempt to reduce envy among agents.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 2** has the highest initial value for an item (96 for item 4), so they choose item 4.
2. **Agent 0** has the next highest value for an unallocated item (58 for item 5), so they choose item 5.
3. **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest (61), so they choose item 6.
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 the highest (85), so they choose item 7.
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 the highest (80), so they choose item 2.
6. **Agent 2** next highest value is item 1 (93), so they choose item 1.
7. **Agent 3** next highest value is item 0 (57), so they choose item 0.
8. **Agent 1** next highest value is item 3 (39), so they choose item 3.

This results in the following allocation, ensuring that each agent has at least one item and no item is left unallocated:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [7, 0],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed, and each agent gets a share that they value highly, attempting to minimize envy.
