Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33   0  16  63  45   5  75  47
1  28  81  19  19  95  39  83  51
2  89  62  24  82  69  42  86  93
3  45  79  86  84  42  74  48  55
4  24  18  29  65  50  13  50   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that envy is minimized or eliminated. Here, we aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.

Let's consider a simple approach to assigning the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent for whom it has the highest value, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure that every agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are distributed.

Following this method, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest value by Agent 2 (89)
- Item 1: Highest value by Agent 1 (81)
- Item 2: Highest value by Agent 3 (86)
- Item 3: Highest value by Agent 0 (63)
- Item 4: Highest value by Agent 1 (95)
- Item 5: Highest value by Agent 3 (74)
- Item 6: Highest value by Agent 2 (86)
- Item 7: Highest value by Agent 2 (93)

Now, check the allocations to ensure that each agent gets at least one item:

- Agents that currently have items: 0, 1, 2, 3
- Agent 4 has no items, so we need to adjust.

We can adjust the allocation by moving one of the less valued items from an agent with multiple items to Agent 4:

- Move Item 0 from Agent 2 to Agent 4 (since Agent 4 values Item 0 at 24, which is the highest value they have for any item).

After this adjustment, here is one fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
