Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  75   0  76  53  23  49  20
1  28  36   1  63  55   4   7  80
2  62  11  26  96  72  78  15  25
3  66  61  82  56  76  41  61  55
4  74  71  63  93  74  73   2   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To tackle this fair division problem, we'll aim for an allocation that is envy-free, meaning each agent should prefer their own allocation or be equally satisfied with another's allocation. Given the complexity of ensuring envy-freeness and integer allocations, we'll use a heuristic approach to balance the allocations based on the agents' valuations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Sum the values each agent assigns to all items to understand their overall valuation capacity.

2. **Prioritize Item Allocation**: Allocate items based on maximizing total value for each agent while considering fairness.

3. **Initial Allocations**: Start by giving each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no two agents get the same item.

4. **Resolve Conflicts**: If two or more agents highly value the same item, allocate the item based on maximizing the sum of the remaining unallocated items.

5. **Fill Remaining Items**: Distribute the remaining items to ensure each agent has at least one item, maximizing overall satisfaction.

Let's apply this approach to the given valuations:

### Valuations Table
- **Agent 0**: [56, 75, 0, 76, 53, 23, 49, 20]
- **Agent 1**: [28, 36, 1, 63, 55, 4, 7, 80]
- **Agent 2**: [62, 11, 26, 96, 72, 78, 15, 25]
- **Agent 3**: [66, 61, 82, 56, 76, 41, 61, 55]
- **Agent 4**: [74, 71, 63, 93, 74, 73, 2, 5]

### Initial Allocation

1. **Agent 0**: Item 3 (value 76)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 7 (value 80)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 3 (value 96, conflict with Agent 0)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 2 (value 82)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 3 (value 93, conflict with Agent 0 and Agent 2)

### Resolve Conflicts

- **Item 3**: Highest value for Agent 2 (96), allocate to Agent 2.
- **Agent 0** next highest is Item 1 (value 75)
- **Agent 4** next highest is Item 0 (value 74)

### Fill Remaining Items
- **Agent 3**: Already has Item 2 (82), next highest is Item 4 (76)
- Remaining Items: 5, 6

Distribute remaining items:
- **Agent 0**: Item 6 (value 49)
- **Agent 4**: Item 5 (value 73)

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and aims to maximize satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Note that achieving perfect envy-freeness with strict integer allocations can be challenging, but this solution seeks to balance fairness and efficiency.
