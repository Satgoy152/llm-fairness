Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88   7  87  41   7  14  15  98
1   3  73  74  52  20  92  89  39
2  31  88  35  97   5  23  90  27
3  38   0  43  25  16  19  79  29
4  62  45  79  20  51  33  92  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they received a fair share according to their valuations. Here's an approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:** Compute the total valuation of all items for each agent.

2. **Proportional Fairness:** Distribute the items in a way that each agent gets roughly their fair share based on their total valuation.

3. **Iterative Allocation:** Begin by allocating the highest-valued item for each agent and continue until all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

- **Agent 0:** 
  - Highest valuations: Item 7 (98), Item 0 (88), Item 2 (87)
  - Assign Item 7 to Agent 0

- **Agent 1:** 
  - Highest valuations: Item 5 (92), Item 2 (74), Item 1 (73)
  - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1

- **Agent 2:** 
  - Highest valuations: Item 3 (97), Item 6 (90), Item 1 (88)
  - Assign Item 3 to Agent 2

- **Agent 3:** 
  - Highest valuations: Item 6 (79), Item 2 (43), Item 0 (38)
  - Assign Item 6 to Agent 3

- **Agent 4:** 
  - Highest valuations: Item 6 (92), Item 2 (79), Item 0 (62)
  - Since Item 6 is already taken, assign Item 2 to Agent 4

- **Remaining Items:** 0, 1, 4

- **Allocate Remaining Items:**
  - Agent 0: Assign Item 0
  - Agent 4: Assign Item 4
  - Agent 1: Assign Item 1

### Resulting Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest-valued items first and then distributes the remaining items to balance the allocation based on each agent's total valuation. Each agent receives at least one item, and the total of 8 items is distributed among the agents.
