Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  33  72  83  37   6  25  83
1  98  17  95  26  71  59  13  63
2  46  81   4  34  92  34  29  50
3  95  31   5  23  72  11  54   7
4  10  79  94  16  74  43   1  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that strives for envy-freeness, one approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution. This involves maximizing the product of the utilities of the agents. Given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items, we must allocate all 8 items among the 5 agents based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are relatively high for items 3 (83) and 7 (83). Assigning these items to Agent 0 maximizes their utility.
   
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are highest for items 0 (98) and 2 (95). Assigning these items to Agent 1 maximizes their utility.

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are highest for item 4 (92). Assigning this item to Agent 2 maximizes their utility.

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are highest for item 1 (31). Assigning this item to Agent 3 maximizes their utility.

5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are highest for item 5 (43) and item 6 (1). Assigning these items to Agent 4 makes the most sense.

This allocation strives to ensure that each agent is getting the most valuable items according to their valuations, which helps maintain envy-freeness to the extent possible given the limitations of discrete allocation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```
