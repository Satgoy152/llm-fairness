Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  22  63  42  82  10  27  80
1  20  77  88  40  52   9  91  44
2  16  10  45  21  82  90  20  22
3   6  49  38  62  42  25  78  51
4  12  41  10  41  46  19  72  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, I will employ the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction of each agent. The goal is to allocate the items in a way that each agent values their bundle fairly without envying another agent's bundle. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Compute Total Valuations for Each Agent:**
   - Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items. This will help understand each agent's perspective on the total worth of items.

2. **Identify High-Valuation Items per Agent:**
   - Identify items that are highly valued by each agent. Preferably, allocate these items to the agents who value them the most to increase satisfaction.

3. **Iterative Allocation:**
   - Start by allocating items to agents based on the highest individual valuations. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and try to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

4. **Check for Envy-Freeness:**
   - After initial allocation, check if any agent envies another. Adjust allocations if needed to reduce envy while keeping allocations fair.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Total Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: 420
   - Agent 1: 421
   - Agent 2: 306
   - Agent 3: 351
   - Agent 4: 279

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuations:**

   - Agent 0: Item 0 (94)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (88)
   - Agent 2: Item 5 (90)
   - Agent 3: Item 6 (78)
   - Agent 4: Item 4 (46)

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**

   - Remaining items: 1, 3, 7
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 1 (77)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3 (62)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0 (80)

4. **Final Allocation Check:**

   - Ensure each agent has at least one item and the total number of items is 8.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations and aims to minimize envy among agents.
