Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  12  45  93  47  16  13   1
1  34  44  34  42  71  56   6  54
2  64  89  34  25  50  23  31  30
3  91  69   6   2  40  36  78  35
4  84  49  10  58  67  95  84  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we'll use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This approach is not guaranteed to be envy-free but can help in reducing envy by ensuring each agent gets a reasonable value based on their preferences. Given the valuations, we aim to distribute items so that each agent receives a fair share in terms of their respective valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 3 (Value: 93)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 4, 5 (Values: 71, 56)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 0, 1 (Values: 64, 89)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: 6, 7 (Values: 78, 35)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items: 2 (Value: 10)

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one item they value relatively highly. Let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item according to their preferences, while also considering the overall distribution to minimize envy.
