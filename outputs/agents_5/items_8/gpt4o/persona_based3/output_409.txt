Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  46  58  45  23  25  32  33
1  79  74  28  18  70  13  48  12
2  44   2   9   7   2  46  45   8
3  28  32   9  27  41  51  12   1
4  60  74  90  83  23  20  73   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that ensures envy-freeness, we will leverage the notion of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. This involves ensuring each agent receives at least one item and that the allocation is as balanced as possible given the valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 0 (62), Item 2 (58)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations: Item 0 (79), Item 1 (74), Item 4 (70)
   - Since Item 0 is allocated, allocate Item 1 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations: Item 5 (46), Item 6 (45)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - High valuations: Item 5 (51), Item 4 (41)
   - Since Item 5 is allocated, allocate Item 4 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - High valuations: Item 2 (90), Item 1 (74), Item 3 (83)
   - Since Item 1 is allocated, allocate Item 2 to Agent 4

Remaining items: 3, 6, 7

To ensure all items are allocated:

- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 4 (since Agent 4 values it highly at 83)
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it at 45, second-highest after Item 5)
- Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it at 33, highest among remaining allocations for Agent 0)

After this allocation, each agent has received at least one item, and we have distributed all 8 items. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation considers maximizing the value each agent receives while attempting to maintain a sense of fairness and balance across all agents.
