Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  77   3  70  34  48   7  12
1  12  13  74  81  88   5  62  81
2  82  79  36  53  61  69   9  94
3  92  90   6  89  46  60  98  35
4  80  23  14  84  81  22  11  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We can achieve this by striving for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. 

Given the table of valuations, we can use a simple strategy to distribute items by maximizing the total value each agent receives and trying to balance the high-value items among them. Below is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 0 and 1 highly.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for items 2, 3, and 4.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 7.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for items 0, 3, and 6.
- Agent 4 has relatively high valuations for items 3 and 4.

To balance these preferences and fairly allocate items, we proceed as follows:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (highest value for item 0).
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 1).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 2).
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (second-highest value after Agent 1, but Agent 1 is getting item 2).
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest value for item 4).
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 5).
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 3 (highest value for item 6).
8. Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (highest value for item 7).

This allocation takes into account the highest preferences for each agent while aiming to balance the distribution of items. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 3, 6],
    "4": []
}
```
