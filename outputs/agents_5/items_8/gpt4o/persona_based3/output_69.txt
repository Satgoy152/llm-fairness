Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  88  27  36  46  59   8  93
1  46  18  91  56  53  77  20  31
2  92  56  88  57  74  33   8  37
3  62  71  95  14  56  73  89   6
4  68   2  20   3  10  22  60  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the allocation is as fair as possible. The goal is to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, meaning each agent should feel that they received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's consider the valuations provided in the table and try to allocate the items to ensure fairness:

Valuation Table:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  88  27  36  46  59   8  93
1  46  18  91  56  53  77  20  31
2  92  56  88  57  74  33   8  37
3  62  71  95  14  56  73  89   6
4  68   2  20   3  10  22  60  58
```

### Allocation Strategy
We will attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's utility based on their valuations, ensuring that the overall allocation is balanced and as envy-free as possible. We'll focus on maximizing agents' satisfaction with the items they receive.

### Allocation Steps:
1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 7 (93) and item 1 (88). We'll allocate these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 2 (91). We'll allocate this to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 0 (92) and item 4 (74). We'll allocate these to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 6 (89) and item 5 (73). We'll allocate these to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The remaining items are 3 and 5. Agent 4 values item 7 the most (58), but since it's already allocated, we'll allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

### Final Allocation
After considering the allocations based on the highest valuations and attempting to minimize envy, we can represent the allocation as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
