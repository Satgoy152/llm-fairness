Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  33  97  32  43  75  26  66
1  60  42  37  57   4  43  63  84
2   3  49  62  61  82  87   6  83
3  44  51  28  97  24   3  15  60
4  88  37  91  40  58  43  42  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own. Given the constraints, we also need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Using the valuation matrix provided, we can attempt a fair division using the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which often leads to envy-free allocations. This approach tries to maximize the product of the agents' utilities derived from their bundles.

Below is one possible allocation that attempts to respect these principles while ensuring all items are allocated:

- Agent 0 gets items: 2, 5
- Agent 1 gets items: 7
- Agent 2 gets items: 4, 6
- Agent 3 gets items: 3
- Agent 4 gets items: 0, 1

This allocation is designed to be as fair as possible given the constraints, aiming to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This distribution is designed to balance the satisfaction of each agent by maximizing their perceived value of the received items while ensuring all items are allocated.
