Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  83   5  68  38  31  59  69
1  56  32   3  25  36  32  77  71
2  22  32  59  36  94  77  78  51
3  67  98   9  52  68  48  84  75
4  90  54  64   8   9  39  32  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for a solution that is envy-free or as close to envy-freeness as possible. Envy-freeness implies that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's approach this problem by checking the valuations and distributing the items to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the most.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 the most but has high valuations for items 0 and 6 as well.
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the most.

Considering these observations, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items 1 and 7 (high valuations and satisfy Agent 0's preferences).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6 (highest valuation).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4 (highest valuation).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 0 (second-highest valuation after item 1, which is allocated to Agent 0).
- **Agent 4**: Allocate items 2, 3, and 5 (remaining items with reasonably high valuations for Agent 4).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible while ensuring that all items are distributed.
