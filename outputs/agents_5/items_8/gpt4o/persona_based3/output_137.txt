Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  84  87  41  86  95  69  10
1  22  56  63  52  10  12  11  80
2  47  93  76  56  85   4  17  44
3  98  69  16  95  62  36  21  47
4  48  86  28  46  41  55  49  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the agents' preferences and attempt to create an envy-free or as close to envy-free allocation as possible. An envy-free allocation means each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation.

Here's an allocation strategy that attempts to balance the interests based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for most items, especially item 5. Allocating item 5 (value 95) to Agent 0 gives them a strong start. We also give them item 0 (value 71) to balance their allocation.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 seems to value item 7 highly. Allocating item 7 (value 80) to Agent 1 satisfies one of their higher preferences. We can also give them item 2 (value 63) to ensure they have a reasonable total value.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 1 highly. Allocating item 1 (value 93) to Agent 2 makes sense. We also allocate item 4 (value 85) to Agent 2, which they value significantly.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 highly. Allocating item 3 (value 95) to Agent 3 would maximize their satisfaction with the allocation.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent has a relatively balanced preference but can be given item 6 (value 49) and item 8, which doesnâ€™t exist, and thus I will instead give them item 6 only.

The allocations attempt to be as fair as possible based on the agents' valuations of the items. Each agent gets two items except for Agent 4, who receives one item due to the high preference value of the items they are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6]
}
```
