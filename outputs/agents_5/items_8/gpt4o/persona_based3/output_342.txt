Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  22   7   4  90  75  59  61
1  95  59  43  48  66  33  63  41
2  64  35  61  36  61  97   7  79
3   1  96  87  64  58  18  36  41
4  89  27  21  56   5  63  71  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to find an allocation where each agent receives items such that no agent feels envy towards another agent's allocation. This involves balancing the total value each agent derives from their allocated items.

Let's consider a possible allocation approach using a method like the envy-free algorithm or approximation for simplicity. We want to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Analyzing the table, we can try to allocate the items using a heuristic approach:
- Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent in a round-robin fashion, considering their valuations.
- Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a possible allocation based on the valuation matrix:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4 and 0. Allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 and 1. Allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5. Allocate item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most. Allocate item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 7 the most. Allocate item 7 to agent 4.

After this initial allocation, we still have items 2, 3, and 6 remaining. We can further adjust as follows:

- Allocate item 6 to agent 0, as they have a decent valuation for it.
- Allocate item 2 to agent 3, as they have a high valuation.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 4, as this helps to balance the overall distribution.

Here's the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [7, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and attempts have been made to balance the total valuations as evenly as possible among the agents given the constraints.
