Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  18  84  10  59  37   2  39
1  71  26  55  67  74   3  47  53
2  70  10  92  36  78  50  72  22
3  13  18  71  83  88  22  77  76
4  62  11  81   5  43  37  81  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can utilize the concept of maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share, taking into account their valuations of each item.

To start, let's examine the agents' valuations for the items and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent gets an approximately equal share of total value, based on their own valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** Prefers item 0 (value 96) the most.
2. **Agent 1:** Prefers item 4 (value 74) the most.
3. **Agent 2:** Prefers item 2 (value 92) the most.
4. **Agent 3:** Prefers item 4 (value 88) the most, but since agent 1 also values it highly, we look at the second highest, item 3 (value 83).
5. **Agent 4:** Prefers items 2 and 6 (both value 81) but since item 2 is already taken by agent 2, we assign item 6.

To ensure each agent receives a fair allocation, let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Assign item 6 to agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 1, 5, and 7.

- Agent 0 could get item 1 (value 18), as they have a relatively low valuation for the remaining items.
- Agent 1 could get item 5 (value 3), as they value it the least, maintaining fairness.
- Agent 3 could get item 7 (value 76), as they have a higher preference for it compared to agent 2.

The allocations ensure that every agent receives at least one item and that the distribution is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This distribution respects the agents' preferences and attempts to minimize envy among them.
