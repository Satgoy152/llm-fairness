Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  71  69  86  31  29  13  65
1   7  45  84  63  35  72  73  52
2  54  64  59  48  95  25  94  12
3  67  84  26  33  68  62  93  12
4  55  59  43  22  34  50  87   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's approach this problem by attempting to maximize the minimum satisfaction across agents. We will consider each agent's total valuation for their allocated items and try to balance the allocations.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items: [3, 7] 
   - Total valuation: 86 + 65 = 151

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items: [2, 5] 
   - Total valuation: 84 + 72 = 156

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items: [4, 6] 
   - Total valuation: 95 + 94 = 189

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items: [1] 
   - Total valuation: 84

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Items: [0] 
   - Total valuation: 55

This allocation aims to balance the total valuations each agent receives as fairly as possible, given the constraints.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items such that their overall valuation is balanced, and all 8 items are distributed.
