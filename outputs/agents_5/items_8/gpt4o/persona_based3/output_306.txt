Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  29  28  13  94  54  14  26
1  75  92  23  89  54  77  77  15
2  53  72  73  57  11  20   0   3
3  52  89  12  49   2  15  41  86
4  65  51  87  55  37  30  17  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation, given their respective valuations of the items.

To achieve this, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which attempts to maximize the product of the utilities of all agents. This approach is known for generating allocations that are both Pareto efficient and envy-free up to one item.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for item 4 (94) and item 1 (29).
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 1 (92) and 3 (89).
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 2 (73) and 1 (72).
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 1 (89) and 7 (86).
5. **Agent 4**: Has high valuations for items 2 (87) and 7 (83).

Considering these preferences and to ensure a fair distribution, we can allocate items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: [4] - Allocating the item with the highest value (94).
- **Agent 1**: [3, 5] - Allocating items where Agent 1 has relatively higher valuations.
- **Agent 2**: [2] - Allocating the item with the highest value for Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: [7, 6] - Allocating items where Agent 3 has relatively higher valuations.
- **Agent 4**: [0, 1] - Allocating items where Agent 4 has relatively higher valuations.

Below is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7, 6],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the allocations based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share of the items.
