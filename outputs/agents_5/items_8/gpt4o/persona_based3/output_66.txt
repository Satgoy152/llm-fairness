Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  10   3  82  48  83  51   3
1  79  16   5  88  87  82  88  64
2  42  45  40  92  22  28  59  85
3  98   8  93  73  38  83  33  83
4  14  53   9  68  14  10  90  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to create a distribution that attempts to achieve envy-freeness, where possible, or at least minimize envy. Given the valuations, I will attempt to allocate items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction with their allocation relative to others.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are highest for item 3 and 5. Assign item 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are highest for items 0, 6, and 3. Assign items 0 and 6.
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are highest for items 3 and 7. Assign item 7.
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are highest for items 0, 2, and 5. Assign items 2 and 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are highest for items 6 and 4. Assign items 1 and 4.

This allocation gives each agent items that are among their highest-valued options while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers agents' highest preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
