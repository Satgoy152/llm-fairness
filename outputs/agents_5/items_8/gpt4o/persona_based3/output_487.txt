Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  71  52  96  81  15  78  81
1  90  50  92  40  21  97   8  66
2  37  94  91  68  14  85  41  85
3  70  92  36  16  70  42  24   9
4  42  36  59  17  92  12  18   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives items in a way that reflects their valuations. One possible approach is to use a combination of fairness criteria, such as maximizing each agent's minimum utility or ensuring that the allocation is envy-free if possible.

Let's begin by analyzing the valuations provided by each agent for the items:

- Agent 0: [27, 71, 52, 96, 81, 15, 78, 81]
- Agent 1: [90, 50, 92, 40, 21, 97, 8, 66]
- Agent 2: [37, 94, 91, 68, 14, 85, 41, 85]
- Agent 3: [70, 92, 36, 16, 70, 42, 24, 9]
- Agent 4: [42, 36, 59, 17, 92, 12, 18, 4]

Let's first assign each agent their highest valued item, if possible, to reduce potential envy:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (96).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 5 (97).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 1 (94).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1 (92), but it is already assigned to Agent 2. The next highest is item 0 (70).
5. Agent 4 highly values item 4 (92).

Now, we will assign the remaining items, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

- Agent 0: Already has item 3. Let's also give them item 2 (52).
- Agent 1: Already has item 5. Let's also give them item 7 (66).
- Agent 2: Already has item 1. Let's also give them item 6 (41).
- Agent 3: Already has item 0.
- Agent 4: Already has item 4.

Now, we have allocated all 8 items: 3, 2, 5, 7, 1, 6, 0, 4.

Here's how the allocation looks:

- Agent 0: [3, 2]
- Agent 1: [5, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 6]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [4]

Finally, the fair allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
