Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  84  35  99  55  43   8   9
1  43  82  60  97  44  40  85  55
2   4  97  84  13  30  77  32  11
3  14  31  12  22  92  25  67  46
4  15  35  24  38  45  59  42  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, considering the values each agent assigns to the items. We have to ensure that each agent gets some items, and the total number of items distributed equals 8.

Given the valuations, here's one method to allocate items to achieve a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0 such as item 3 (value 99).

2. **Agent 1**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 1 such as item 6 (value 85) and item 3 (value 97) if not already taken.

3. **Agent 2**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 2 such as item 1 (value 97).

4. **Agent 3**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 3 such as item 4 (value 92).

5. **Agent 4**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 4 such as item 5 (value 59).

Now, we try to balance the allocation so that each agent receives items they value highly, attempting to maintain envy-freeness:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

After these high-value allocations, assign the remaining items to balance the total number of items and try to maintain fairness:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (Agent 4 has fewer items).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (Agent 0 has fewer items).

This allocation provides each agent with items they value, though not perfectly envy-free, it balances the allocations given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```
