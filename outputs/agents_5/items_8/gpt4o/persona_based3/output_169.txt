Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  97  58   3  14  64  17  56
1  87  46  74  56  63  10  91   9
2  77  38  23  70  83  36  45  35
3  34  84  14  15   3  38  72  17
4  60   6  62  17  53  34  48  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's bundle over their own. Given the complexity of the problem and the integer constraints on item allocation, we may not achieve perfect envy-freeness but can strive to minimize envy.

We can use a simple approach by looking for allocations where each agent gets at least one item they highly value, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is a possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it highly (97).
2. Assign item 6 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it highly (91).
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it highly (83).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 because agent 3 values it highly (15).
5. Assign item 7 to agent 4 because agent 4 values it highly (68).
6. Assign item 0 to agent 1 as a secondary item valued at 87.
7. Assign item 2 to agent 4 as a secondary item valued at 62.
8. Assign item 5 to agent 3 as a secondary item valued at 38.

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of high-valued items among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents, and each agent receives at least one item they value significantly.
