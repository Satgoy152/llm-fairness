Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  24  77   5  14  51  29   4
1  24  25  57  96  12  53   6  77
2  43  98  62  28  20  41   4   4
3  65  84  92   9  57   7   9  33
4  84  20  11  65   4   7  62  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, since achieving perfect envy-freeness can be complex and sometimes impossible with discrete items and varying valuations, we'll aim for a balanced allocation that attempts to minimize envy.

We'll start by considering the total value each agent places on the items and distribute items to ensure a balanced distribution of total value each agent receives. Here's a plan for the allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** First, determine the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their preferences better.

2. **Initial Allocation:** We'll start by allocating the item that each agent values the most, ensuring no item is allocated twice.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** After the initial allocation, we'll adjust to ensure each agent receives a fair share, balancing the total value of items received as much as possible.

Hereâ€™s the detailed calculation and allocation:

### Total Valuation of Items by Each Agent:
- Agent 0: 54 + 24 + 77 + 5 + 14 + 51 + 29 + 4 = 258
- Agent 1: 24 + 25 + 57 + 96 + 12 + 53 + 6 + 77 = 350
- Agent 2: 43 + 98 + 62 + 28 + 20 + 41 + 4 + 4 = 300
- Agent 3: 65 + 84 + 92 + 9 + 57 + 7 + 9 + 33 = 356
- Agent 4: 84 + 20 + 11 + 65 + 4 + 7 + 62 + 66 = 319

### Allocation Strategy:
- **Agent 0:** Values item 2 the most (77), allocate item 2.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 3 the most (96), allocate item 3.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 1 the most (98), allocate item 1.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 2, but already allocated, next highest is item 0 (65), allocate item 0.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 0, but already allocated, next highest is item 7 (66), allocate item 7.

### Remaining Items:
- Items 4, 5, and 6 are still unallocated. Let's allocate them to balance the total value further:

- **Agent 0:** Add item 5 (51) to increase their total value.
- **Agent 4:** Add item 6 (62) to increase their total value.
- **Agent 3:** Add item 4 (57) to increase their total value.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [7, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent while respecting the items each agent values the most.
