Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  49  75  25  66  31  70  26
1  93  64  59  54  73   8  89  22
2  55  68  58  34   6  18  62  55
3  44   2  92  13  32  85  24  39
4  70  37  36  74   8  12  49  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 64 59 54 73  8 89 22]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve a division where each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total value while maintaining an overall balance among the agents. A common approach to achieve fairness is to use the concept of Envy-Free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations table, we will attempt to allocate the items in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share. The goal is to maximize fairness and minimize envy. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has relatively high values for items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 values item 0 significantly.
- Agent 2 has moderate values across items, but item 1 stands out.
- Agent 3 has a high value for item 5.
- Agent 4 values item 7 the most.

Based on this analysis, here's a reasonable allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 3: Item [5]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 7]

This allocation tries to balance each agent's total valuation, considering their highest preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated. Now, I'll present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
