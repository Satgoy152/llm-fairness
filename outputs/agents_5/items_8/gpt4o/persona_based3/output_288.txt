Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  89  93  29  44  44  97  46
1  32  90   8   1  96  71   2  27
2  27  42   1  29  75  34  71  83
3  75  15  82  34  13  58  95  81
4  70  90  59  66  57  24  48  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to minimize envy among the agents. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that there are 8 items and 5 agents, at least three agents will receive one item, and two agents will receive two items each.

Let's perform the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Identify High-Value Preferences:** Start by identifying the items that have significantly high values for each agent. This will help us make allocations that maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 6 (value 97).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 4 (value 96).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 7 (value 83).
   - Agent 3 highly values item 6 (value 95, but already taken by Agent 0) and item 2 (value 82).
   - Agent 4 highly values item 1 (value 90).

3. **Resolve Conflicts:**
   - Item 6 is desired by both Agent 0 and Agent 3, but Agent 0 has a slightly higher valuation for item 6. Thus, it will remain with Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 1 can take item 5 (value 71) as their second item.
   - Agent 2 can take item 3 (value 29) as their second item.
   - Agent 4 can take item 0 (value 70) as their second item.
   - Agent 3 can take item 7 (value 81) as their second item.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Allocate remaining items to balance the allocation.

Following the above steps, here's a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible, given the constraints.
