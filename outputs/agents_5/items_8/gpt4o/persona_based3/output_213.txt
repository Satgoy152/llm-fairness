Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  50  70  71  43  57  11  82
1  87  52  95  53  12  38  49  12
2  31  85  72  80  50   6  73  32
3  10  67  98  15  72  43  22   4
4  13  60  95  54  69  14  56  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as (or more than) any other agent's bundle. Let's try to approach this problem using a simple envy-free allocation method by assigning items based on each agent's individual preferences.

First, let's inspect the table to identify the items that each agent values the most:

| Agent | Item with Highest Value | Value |
|-------|-------------------------|-------|
| 0     | 7                       | 82    |
| 1     | 2                       | 95    |
| 2     | 3                       | 80    |
| 3     | 2                       | 98    |
| 4     | 2                       | 95    |

Now, let's try to allocate items to each agent, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and that envy is minimized:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 7. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 2, which is already taken. The next highest value is item 1 (67). Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is item 2, which is already taken. The next highest value is item 1 (60), which is also taken. Allocate item 4 (69) to Agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate the remaining 3 items. We will continue by considering the next highest preferences:

- Allocate item 0 (12) to Agent 0 as it has the lowest remaining value for others.
- Allocate item 5 (57) to Agent 0, as they have a relatively high value for it compared to others.
- Allocate item 6 (73) to Agent 2, as they value it highly.

Now each agent has at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated. The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and attempts to minimize envy by considering each agent's preferences.
