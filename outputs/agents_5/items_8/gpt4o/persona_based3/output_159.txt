Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  20  75  59  65  81  48   1
1  90   9  57  22  88  26  33   2
2  56  98  25  13  84  25  79  37
3  69  62  90  87  84  32  58  45
4  75  27  31  85  29  90   3  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This is a complex problem, but I will attempt to provide a solution that balances the valuations as best as possible given the constraints.

Here is a step-by-step approach to allocate the items fairly:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations:** First, we calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.

2. **Find the Highest Valuation for Each Item:** Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation to ensure that each agent gets the item they value most.

3. **Adjust for Balance:** Make adjustments to ensure that all agents receive a fair share, considering their total valuation.

### Step 1: Total Valuations

- Agent 0: 54 + 20 + 75 + 59 + 65 + 81 + 48 + 1 = 403
- Agent 1: 90 + 9 + 57 + 22 + 88 + 26 + 33 + 2 = 327
- Agent 2: 56 + 98 + 25 + 13 + 84 + 25 + 79 + 37 = 417
- Agent 3: 69 + 62 + 90 + 87 + 84 + 32 + 58 + 45 = 527
- Agent 4: 75 + 27 + 31 + 85 + 29 + 90 + 3 + 78 = 418

### Step 2: Assign Highest Valuation

- Item 0 (54, 90, 56, 69, 75): Assign to Agent 1
- Item 1 (20, 9, 98, 62, 27): Assign to Agent 2
- Item 2 (75, 57, 25, 90, 31): Assign to Agent 3
- Item 3 (59, 22, 13, 87, 85): Assign to Agent 4
- Item 4 (65, 88, 84, 84, 29): Assign to Agent 1
- Item 5 (81, 26, 25, 32, 90): Assign to Agent 4
- Item 6 (48, 33, 79, 58, 3): Assign to Agent 2
- Item 7 (1, 2, 37, 45, 78): Assign to Agent 4

### Step 3: Adjust for Balance

After assigning based on the highest valuation, we need to adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and no more than others unless their preferences strongly dictate so.

- Agent 0 receives no items initially, so we reallocate Item 0 or another item to Agent 0 to ensure fairness.

Final allocations attempt to balance based on total valuation and preferences.

### Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 5, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets items such that the envy is minimized. The allocation tries to balance across high preferences and overall valuations.
