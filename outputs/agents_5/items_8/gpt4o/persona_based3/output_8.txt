Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  90  40  71  30  92  16   9
1  61   6  41  95  31  54  53  68
2  39  36  55  49  99  25  43  18
3  65   2  24  63  33  60  31  90
4  80  59   1  23  45  10  44  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items. A common approach is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. However, achieving exact envy-freeness with integer allocations can be challenging, so we strive for approximate envy-freeness where possible.

Here's an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 5 (92) and item 1 (90), so these should be prioritized for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3 (95), so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (99), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 7 (90), so allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 0 (80), so allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2, 6):

- Agent 0 has already received items 1 and 5. Consider fairness by assigning lower-priority items to other agents.
- Agent 1 could receive item 2, as their next highest valuation (41) is for item 2.
- Agent 2 could receive item 6, as their next highest valuation (43) is for item 6.

This allocation attempts to balance valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with items they value highly, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.
