Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87   8  47  75   8  28  67  73
1  85  64  21  14  13  64  34  41
2  73  26  73  74  29  58  39  13
3  52  45  68  92  54  28  71  26
4   9  54  48  71  89  80   0  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute items such that each agent prefers their allocation over others as much as possible. Given that there are 8 items and 5 agents, one or more agents will have to receive more than one item to allocate all items.

Let's go through the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for item 0 (87), item 3 (75), and item 7 (73). We'll allocate items that maximize their total value while ensuring others aren't envious. Let's start with item 0 (87).

2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0 (85), but it is already taken. Next highest are items 1 (64) and 5 (64). We'll give item 5 (64) to avoid direct competition with other agents' high preferences.

3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for item 0 (73), item 2 (73), and item 3 (74). With item 0 allocated, we'll give item 2 (73) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 3 (92). Item 3 can be allocated to Agent 3 as it doesn't conflict with other high preferences.

5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 4 (89). We'll allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. To allocate the remaining 3 items:

- Agent 0 can be further allocated item 7 (73), increasing their total value significantly.
- Agent 1 can be allocated item 6 (34), their next highest available preference.
- Agent 4 can take item 1 (54), which is also a high preference for them.

These allocations aim to maximize individual satisfaction according to their highest available preferences while ensuring each agent has at least one item.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to be envy-free by respecting each agent's higher value preferences as much as possible given the constraints.
