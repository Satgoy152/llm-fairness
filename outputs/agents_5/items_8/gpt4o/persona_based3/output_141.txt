Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  93  51  82  60  83  89  60
1  29  32   6  89   2  40  75  45
2  99  52  69  26  61  79   9  43
3  34  80  86  27  20  61  88  95
4  14  96  49  20  58  45  13  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the items to the agents in a way that is fair, ideally aiming for envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own allocation.

One approach to achieve a fair division is to use the method of maximizing the minimum utility, which ensures that the agent with the least satisfaction still has the best possible outcome. Another approach is to use a round-robin or bidding method, but given the lack of specific rules in the prompt, we will aim for a reasonable distribution.

Let's analyze the table and the valuations:

```
       0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
    0  48  93  51  82  60  83  89  60
    1  29  32   6  89   2  40  75  45
    2  99  52  69  26  61  79   9  43
    3  34  80  86  27  20  61  88  95
    4  14  96  49  20  58  45  13  56
```

The goal is to distribute all eight items among the five agents. We will try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation is as fair as possible.

A possible allocation strategy is as follows:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 1 highly, so we will allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 3 highly, so we will allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 0 very highly, so we will allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 7 highly, so we will allocate item 7 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 4 highly, so we will allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Now, we have distributed 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (2, 5, and 6). We will prioritize agents based on their next highest valuations.

6. **Agent 0:** Next highest valuation is item 6, so allocate item 6 to agent 0.
7. **Agent 4:** Next highest valuation is item 5, so allocate item 5 to agent 4.
8. **Agent 2:** Next highest valuation is item 2, so allocate item 2 to agent 2.

Thus, all items are allocated. The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims for fairness by considering each agent's highest-valued items first, then distributing the remaining items based on next highest preferences.
