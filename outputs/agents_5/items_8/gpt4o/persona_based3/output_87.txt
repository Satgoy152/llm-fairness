Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  27  11  46  27  20  56   4
1  89  37  60  40  12  72  80  29
2  20  73  92  22  13   7  81  66
3  50   6  84  64  51  94  28  11
4  51   8  74  18  64   1  22  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own, based on their individual valuations.

Given the table of valuations, we will attempt to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their preferences. This often involves ensuring that the allocation maximizes the minimum satisfaction among agents or follows some other fairness criterion.

Let's calculate a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Prefers item 6 with a value of 56.
2. **Agent 1:** Prefers item 0 with a value of 89.
3. **Agent 2:** Prefers item 2 with a value of 92.
4. **Agent 3:** Prefers item 5 with a value of 94.
5. **Agent 4:** Prefers item 4 with a value of 64.

For the remaining items, we need to consider the next highest preferences while trying to maintain fairness:

6. **Agent 0:** Next prefers item 3 with a value of 46.
7. **Agent 1:** Next prefers item 6 with a value of 80 (already taken by Agent 0), so item 5 with a value of 72.
8. **Agent 3:** Already has item 5, so next prefers item 3 with a value of 64 (already taken by Agent 0), thus item 1 with a value of 6.
9. **Agent 4:** Already has item 4, so next prefers item 1 with a value of 8 (already taken by Agent 3), thus item 7 with a value of 43.

Here is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0
- Agent 2: Items 2
- Agent 3: Items 5, 1
- Agent 4: Items 4, 7

This allocation ensures each agent receives the items they value most highly, given the constraints, and tries to distribute the remaining items in a way that is fair.

Final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
