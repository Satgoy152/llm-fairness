Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  13  23  27  53  30  66  51
1  89  85  26  43  54  78  33  11
2  32  72  25  58  25  10  29  67
3  50  18  39  30  89  87  82  96
4  45  79  27  86  37  82  96  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we will consider a strategy that maximizes each agent's value while being mindful of the overall distribution. The goal is to ensure that no agent feels they would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations, we can approach this problem by attempting to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item to maintain a fair distribution.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify Highest Value for Each Item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. **Allocate Items**: Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If an agent ends up with no items, reallocate items from agents with multiple items to ensure all agents receive at least one item.

Let's follow this approach with the given table:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it the most (89).
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most (85).
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (23).
- **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it the most (86).
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most (89).
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (78).
- **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most (96).
- **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most (96).

After this initial allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 5]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [4, 7]
- Agent 4: [3, 6]

Agent 2 has no items. We will reallocate some items to ensure each agent has at least one item:

- Transfer item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it more than the other items Agent 1 has.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [4, 7]
- Agent 4: [3, 6]

Now, each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items is 8, ensuring a fair allocation.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```
