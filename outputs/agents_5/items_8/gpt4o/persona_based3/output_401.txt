Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  74   4  61  57  77   7  14
1  50  15  86  93  67  79  43  56
2  27  22   3  91  86  99  15  66
3  15  61  93  35  84  57  95   0
4  54  37  91  78  42   9   9  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We can use a procedure that considers each agent's preferences and attempts to balance the distribution of items so that no agent envies another's allocation. Here is a straightforward approach to achieve this:

1. **Compute Total Value for Each Agent**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to have a sense of their overall valuation.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no item is assigned more than once and trying to balance the allocation as evenly as possible.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If some agents have significantly less value in their allocation, swap items to improve those allocations, ensuring that each agent's allocation is as close to their total value percentage as possible.

Let's proceed with this method for the given valuations:

### Step-by-Step Allocation

1. **Initial Allocation Based on Maximum Valuation per Agent**:
   - Agent 0: Allocates item 5 (value 77).
   - Agent 1: Allocates item 3 (value 93).
   - Agent 2: Allocates item 5 (value 99, but already allocated to Agent 0, pick next highest: item 4, value 86).
   - Agent 3: Allocates item 2 (value 93).
   - Agent 4: Allocates item 2 (value 91, but already allocated to Agent 3, pick next highest: item 3, value 78, but already allocated, pick next: item 0, value 54).

2. **Adjust Allocation to Ensure All Items are Assigned**:
   - We need to assign remaining items [1, 6, 7].
   - Agent 0: Add item 1 (value 74).
   - Agent 1: Add item 7 (value 56).
   - Agent 2: Add item 6 (value 15).

### Final Allocations

After ensuring all items are fairly distributed, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the allocation attempts to minimize envy by considering the highest value allocations possible within constraints.
