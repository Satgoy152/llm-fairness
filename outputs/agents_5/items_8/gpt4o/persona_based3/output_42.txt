Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  72  31  79  78  99   4  21  68
1  83  76  16  45  76  50  82  59
2   7  22   2  11  70  71  38  51
3  57  32  16  41  38  70  83   9
4  53  12  69  44   0  98  24  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute them in a way that minimizes envy. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. However, achieving complete envy-freeness can be challenging, especially with integer allocations and distinct valuations.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: Start by identifying items that have high valuations for each agent, making them more likely to be satisfied with their allocation.

2. **Allocate items to maximize individual satisfaction**: Attempt to assign each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and no more than two (since there are 8 items and 5 agents).

3. **Iterate and adjust**: If an agent ends up with no items, adjust allocations to ensure everyone receives something.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 highly values items 4 and 2.
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 and item 6.
- Agent 2 highly values item 5.
- Agent 3 highly values item 6 and item 5.
- Agent 4 highly values item 5.

We distribute the items as follows to balance the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: Item [3]
- Agent 4: Items [1, 7]

This allocation ensures each agent gets an item, and the items are distributed based on the agents' preferences as much as possible. Note that complete envy-freeness may not be possible, but this allocation aims to minimize dissatisfaction and maximize individual preference satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```
