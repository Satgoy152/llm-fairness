Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  89  82   0  29  96  75  68
1  76  82   1  55  72  14  85  68
2  90  26  27  13  86  94  58  88
3  25  21  67  76  67  24  11  44
4  17  24  53  65  71  78  59  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation as much as possible. This involves attempting to distribute items such that each agent perceives their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations and discrete items, we will focus on a pragmatic distribution that strives to minimize envy.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:**
   - Identify which items have the highest total valuation across all agents and ensure they are distributed among different agents to avoid concentration of high value with one agent.

2. **Equalize Distribution:**
   - Make sure each agent receives at least one item or the closest approximation to equal distribution based on total value.

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - Assign items iteratively, considering each agent's valuations to minimize the difference in perceived value.

Using these principles, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5 and 0.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 2 values item 5 and 0 highly.
- Agent 3 has a relatively high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 4 has a balanced valuation but values item 5 relatively high.

Given these observations, we can make the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items based on agents' high valuations and aims for a balanced distribution of perceived value. Each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with no two agents allocated the same item.
