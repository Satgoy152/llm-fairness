Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  83  25  16  61   5   0  67
1  81  71  18  86  94   7  37  39
2  88  46  29  83  73  21   5  97
3  73  23  34  69  37  94   3   1
4   7  47  97  82  52  74  80  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among agents while ensuring that the allocation is envy-free to the extent possible, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. The goal is to allocate all 8 items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the allocation is as fair as possible based on their valuations.

One approach to achieve an envy-free allocation is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of utilities and tends to be envy-free or nearly envy-free in practice. However, given the discrete nature of the problem and integer constraints, perfect envy-freeness may not be achievable.

Here's an allocation that takes into account the utilities and attempts to balance the distribution:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (83) and item 0 (47).
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly (94) and item 3 (86).
- Agent 2 values item 7 very highly (97).
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly (94).
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly (97).

Based on these preferences, an allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 2

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 3, 6) in a way that improves fairness and balances the allocations:

- Agent 0 could also get item 0 (since they value it fairly well).
- Agent 1 could get item 3 (since they value it highly).
- Agent 4 could get item 6 (as they have a preference for more items).

This leads to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the high valuations of each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Note that some agents may still experience envy, but this allocation aims to minimize overall dissatisfaction given the constraints.
