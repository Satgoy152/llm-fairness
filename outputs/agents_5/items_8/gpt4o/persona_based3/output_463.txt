Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  63  18  17  43  47  29  83
1  33  93  55  99  25  94  65   8
2  23   1  38  43  23  16  23  52
3  58  49  72  63  34  69  32   9
4  43  20  86   1  25   6   1  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation is one where each agent believes they have received the best possible bundle of items given the circumstances.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Look for items that have the highest individual valuations for each agent.
2. **Balance Total Valuations**: Try to allocate items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible.
3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Each item must be assigned to exactly one agent, and all items should be allocated.

### Allocation Process

- **Agent 0**: Has high valuation for item 7.
- **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 5.
- **Agent 2**: Lower valuations across the board, focus on balance.
- **Agent 3**: Has high valuation for items 2 and 5.
- **Agent 4**: Has high valuation for item 2, but others are mostly lower.

Given these observations, an allocation can be attempted as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 7 (highest valuation for agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 1 and 3 (highest valuations).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 0 and 6 (moderate valuations, balance needs).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 2 and 5 (highest valuations).
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 4 (balance remaining needs).

### Final Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the total perceived value each agent receives, considering their individual preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
