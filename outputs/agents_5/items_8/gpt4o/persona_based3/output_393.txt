Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  15  42  96  73  38  34  72
1   5  57  61  74  51  45   6  58
2  24  10  89   7  50  14   1  29
3  44  25  14   5  41  59  17  57
4  28  44  87  77  63  22  18  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation. In an envy-free allocation, each agent should believe they received the best possible bundle of items according to their own valuations, or at least not prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we can achieve a reasonable allocation by considering the following strategy:

1. Identify the highest-valued item for each agent and attempt to allocate it to them if possible.
2. If conflicts arise (multiple agents value the same item highly), resolve them by considering alternative items with high valuations that minimize the reduction in overall satisfaction.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (value 96). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (value 61). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 2 as well (value 89), but since it's taken, assign item 4 (value 50) to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 5 (value 59). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 7 (value 99). Assign item 7 to Agent 4.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 66).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 57).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3, as it is their next highest valued item (value 17).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
