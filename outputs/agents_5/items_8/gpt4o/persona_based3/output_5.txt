Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  17  65  16  29  42  27   3
1  37  74  63  71  42  48  85  25
2  99  30  10  17  55  89  38  19
3  52  67  72  39  30  24  58  56
4  21   7  75  91  81  54  33  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items while also ensuring that the allocation is envy-free or as fair as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

One approach is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of the utilities of the agents. This is a common method in fair division problems to achieve an allocation that balances efficiency and fairness.

Let's go through the process and derive an allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 65.
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the highest at 85.
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 99.
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 72.
   - Agent 4 values item 3 the highest at 91.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (value = 65).
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value = 85).
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value = 99).
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (value = 91).

3. **Remaining items**: 1, 4, 5, 7.

4. **Allocate remaining items to balance the utility**:
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value = 67), as they have the second highest valuation for this item compared to others.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (value = 81), as it complements their already high valuation item.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value = 89), as it has a high value for this agent.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value = 3), since it is the only agent with a low value for this item, ensuring minimal envy.

5. **Verify the allocation for fairness**:
   - Each agent should have at least one item.
   - The allocation should minimize envy by ensuring no agent prefers another's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

6. **Final Allocation**:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation provides a balance between efficiency and fairness by considering each agent's highest valued items and ensuring that the remaining items are distributed to minimize envy among the agents.
