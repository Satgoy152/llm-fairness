Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  50  78  18   0  85  38  81
1   1  67  19  60  51  89  46  28
2  36  94  32  91  15  61  55  46
3  17  58  74  93  87  70   0  58
4  86  30  68  59  92  84  53  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. However, since we're working with integer allocations and specific item values, a direct application of envy-freeness is not always possible. Instead, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible given the constraints.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [63, 50, 78, 18, 0, 85, 38, 81]
Agent 1: [1, 67, 19, 60, 51, 89, 46, 28]
Agent 2: [36, 94, 32, 91, 15, 61, 55, 46]
Agent 3: [17, 58, 74, 93, 87, 70, 0, 58]
Agent 4: [86, 30, 68, 59, 92, 84, 53, 56]
```

The goal is to distribute these items fairly among 5 agents. We will try to assign items such that each agent has items they value highly, while ensuring no items are left unallocated.

1. **Assign the highest valued items first:**  
   Each agent's highest valued items are:
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (85)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (89)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (94)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 (93)
   - Agent 4: Item 4 (92)

   We notice that Items 5, 3, 1, and 4 are highly valued by multiple agents. We will try to resolve conflicts by assigning items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction.

2. **Resolve conflicts and allocate items:**
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (89) since they value it the highest.
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3 (93).
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (94).
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 4 (92).
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 4 (86) as it is their second-highest value.
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0 (78).
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 0 (38) because they value the remaining items the most.
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0 (81), completing their allocation.

3. **Check allocations:**
   - Agent 0: Items [2, 6, 7]
   - Agent 1: Item [5]
   - Agent 2: Item [1]
   - Agent 3: Item [3]
   - Agent 4: Items [0, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value as highly as possible given the constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items among the 5 agents while attempting to satisfy their preferences optimally.
