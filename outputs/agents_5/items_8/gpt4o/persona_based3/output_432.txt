Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  92   2  69  42  44  84  62
1  83  50  57  41  85  47  47   1
2  39  87  46  44   7  48   2  37
3  32  67  86   9  34  13  86  49
4  25  59  97  97  65  61  59   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method inspired by the concept of envy-freeness. This approach aims to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we allocate items one by one to the agent who values the next unallocated item the most until all items are allocated.

### Steps to Allocate Items:

1. **Initialize**: Start with each agent having an empty allocation.
2. **Iterate Over Items**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most and allocate it to that agent.
3. **Check Envy-freeness**: After allocation, check if any agent envies another's allocation. If so, adjustments can be made if possible, but in this simple greedy method, we won't have room for adjustments after final allocation.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (83), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
- **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (92), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
- **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (97), so assign item 2 to agent 4.
- **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (97), so assign item 3 to agent 4.
- **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (85), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
- **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (61), so assign item 5 to agent 4.
- **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (84), so assign item 6 to agent 0.
- **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (62), so assign item 7 to agent 0.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Items 2, 3, 5

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed and that a basic form of envy-freeness based on valuations is attempted.

### Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 3, 5]
}
```
