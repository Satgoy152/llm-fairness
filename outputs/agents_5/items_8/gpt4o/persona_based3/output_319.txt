Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  36  30  31  52  78  40  98
1  54  68   5  26  76  48  50  84
2  67  90  73  20  44  63  35  16
3  87  20  59  79  22  86  35  33
4  70  25  78  18  79  28  13   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity of achieving absolute envy-freeness, especially with discrete items, we'll attempt a balanced allocation that minimizes envy.

Let's start by analyzing the matrix and the valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 35     | 36     | 30     | 31     | 52     | 78     | 40     | 98     |
| 1     | 54     | 68     | 5      | 26     | 76     | 48     | 50     | 84     |
| 2     | 67     | 90     | 73     | 20     | 44     | 63     | 35     | 16     |
| 3     | 87     | 20     | 59     | 79     | 22     | 86     | 35     | 33     |
| 4     | 70     | 25     | 78     | 18     | 79     | 28     | 13     | 3      |

### Steps to allocate:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 places the highest value (98) on item 7.
   - Agent 1 places the highest value (84) on item 7 but second highest on item 1 (68).
   - Agent 2 places the highest value (90) on item 1.
   - Agent 3 places the highest value (87) on item 0.
   - Agent 4 places the highest value (79) on item 4.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item if there is no conflict.
   - Resolve conflicts by considering second-highest valuations and overall balance.

3. **Proposed Allocation**:
   - Assign item 0 to agent 3 (highest value, no conflict).
   - Assign item 1 to agent 2 (highest value, no conflict).
   - Assign item 2 to agent 4 (highest value among remaining).
   - Assign item 3 to agent 3 (second highest value among remaining).
   - Assign item 4 to agent 4 (highest value, no conflict).
   - Assign item 5 to agent 0 (second highest value among remaining).
   - Assign item 6 to agent 1 (highest value among remaining).
   - Assign item 7 to agent 0 (highest value, no conflict).

This allocation aims to give each agent at least one of their high-valued items, balancing overall fairness and minimizing envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation attempts to reflect their preferences as much as possible given the constraints.
