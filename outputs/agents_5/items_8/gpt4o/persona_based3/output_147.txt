Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  97  37  42  31  88  89  10
1  66  40  13  60  34  81  96  99
2  28  31  29  81  17   5   3   3
3  34  29  47  52  63  40  97  19
4  93  80   8  85  69  44  32  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with the goal of envy-freeness, one approach is to use the method of maximizing the minimum utility or employing a procedure like the adjusted winner procedure. Given the constraints and the specific valuations, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation minimizes envy among the agents.

Let's analyze the valuations to determine a fair allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, yet try to balance the total number of items each agent receives.

2. Consider the maximum value each agent has for an item to minimize envy.

Here's a fair allocation based on these principles:

- Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 4.
- Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 0.
- Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 3.
- Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 2.
- Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 3.
- Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 0.
- Item 6 has the highest value for Agent 1.
- Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 1.

However, some adjustments might be necessary to ensure fairness and to balance the number of items each agent receives. Considering the need for balance, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [6, 7]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [2, 4]
- Agent 4: Item [0]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets one or more items, and it tries to minimize envy based on the highest valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [0]
}
```
