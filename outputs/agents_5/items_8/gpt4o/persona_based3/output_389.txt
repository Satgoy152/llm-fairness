Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  61  85  45  48  10  33  63
1  79  74  44  30  89  13  81   5
2  52  98  28   1  57  77  52  44
3  37  73  14  57  13  75  18  52
4  84   1  89  20  66  28  72  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering their valuations, we seek an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with discrete items can be challenging, especially with a small number of items relative to agents. Instead, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocating the items:

1. **Identify Valuations**: Each agent has a different valuation for each item. We will analyze these valuations to understand preferences.

2. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: A heuristic approach is to allocate items in descending order of agent valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. This can be adjusted to minimize envy further.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: After the initial allocation, we review the allocations to ensure no agent would strongly prefer another agent's allocation over their own. If significant envy is detected, we adjust the allocation.

4. **Iterate until Fair**: Continue adjusting until we have a reasonably fair allocation, given the constraints.

Let's proceed with this process:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most, so we can start by giving item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, we have:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [0]

We still need to allocate items 3, 6, and 7. Let's allocate these by considering envy minimization:

- Agent 0's next highest preference is item 7.
- Agent 1's next highest preference is item 6.
- Agent 3 prefers item 3 over the remaining options.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [2, 7]
- Agent 1: [4, 6]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [5, 3]
- Agent 4: [0]

This allocation attempts to minimize envy given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, aiming to respect their preferences as much as possible.
