Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  11  14  12  79  74  51  55
1   5   1  46  42  91  46   3  20
2  53  78  99  83  85  21  89  74
3  97  66  52  41   2  38   9  58
4  63  40  49  59  83  68  51  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a set of items where the total value of those items is as close as possible to the values received by other agents, thereby minimizing envy. We'll try to achieve an allocation that is as balanced as possible given the constraints.

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 4, so weâ€™ll try to assign those to them to maximize their utility.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 4, but since Agent 0 also values it highly, we might prioritize them elsewhere.
3. **Agent 2** has very high valuations across many items, so distributing some of the high-value items to them can balance the overall distribution.
4. **Agent 3** has a strong preference for item 0, but Agent 0 values it even more, so we might allocate different items to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 7 the highest, making it a good candidate for them.

Following this reasoning, let's attempt an allocation:

- **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 5
- **Agent 1** gets items 3 and 6
- **Agent 2** gets items 2 and 4
- **Agent 3** gets item 1
- **Agent 4** gets item 7

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent based on their preferences. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with a fair division of items based on their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 8 items are allocated overall.
