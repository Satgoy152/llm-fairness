Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  91   2   3  25  59  65  57
1  14  16  90   1  51  17  40   5
2   6  62  92  71  87  97  15  48
3  38  11  89  40  67  57  46  76
4  53   4   1  83   4  34   6  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a simple algorithmic approach. We'll go through a round-robin allocation process based on each agent's valuations to ensure each agent receives some value and, if possible, minimize envy.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Initial Consideration:** Each agent should ideally get a similar total value of items based on their own valuations. We'll start by looking at the highest-valued items for each agent and try to allocate them in a way that maximizes fairness.

2. **Round-Robin Allocation:** In each round, we'll allocate the highest remaining valued item for each agent that hasn't been assigned yet, ensuring that every agent gets a chance to receive one of their most valued items.

3. **Check for Overlap and Adjust:** If multiple agents value the same item highly, resolve conflicts by considering secondary preferences and overall fairness.

Here's how the allocations are made:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 1 and 6.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 2.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 5, 2, and 4.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 2 and 4.
- **Agent 4** highly values item 3.

Considering these preferences, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1, 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 4
- **Agent 3**: Item 7
- **Agent 4**: Items 0, 3

This allocation respects each agent's top preferences as much as possible while distributing items equitably.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```
