Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11   9  56  64  22  97  39  14
1   9  66  28  24  16  37  17   9
2  96   6  52  31  90  41  18  19
3  90  35  44  26  68  46  69  17
4  76  41  68  32  88  79  80  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A commonly used approach for such allocation problems is to use the Envy-Free criterion, which ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation, preventing envy.

Given the valuations, a possible fair allocation can be achieved by analyzing the preferences of each agent and distributing the items to maximize individual satisfaction without causing envy.

Here's the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0. Items 5 and 3 are highly valued by Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Assign items that are valued relatively higher by Agent 1 compared to other agents. Item 1 is a good choice.
3. **Agent 2:** Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly. Item 0 and 4 are highly valued by Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Choose items for Agent 3 that have reasonable valuations and are left over. Item 6 is suitable.
5. **Agent 4:** Assign the remaining highly valued items for Agent 4. Items 2 and 7 are good choices.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an approximately fair share of the total value according to their preferences, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 7]
}
```
