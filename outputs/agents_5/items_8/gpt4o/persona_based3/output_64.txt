Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  24  26  11  60  80  36  98
1   0  38  67  57  49  65  88  68
2  11  10  51  31  94  94   1  11
3  78  69  90  64  19  86  81  60
4  76  57  44  65  54  24  60  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items such that no agent envies another. One common approach to achieving envy-freeness is to use the "round-robin" method or a variant of the "adjusted winner" procedure. However, given that we have a specific set of valuations, we can attempt to manually allocate items to minimize envy.

Here's a proposed allocation strategy:

1. **Item 7 (98, 68, 11, 60, 58):** 
   - This item is most valuable to Agent 0. Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Item 6 (36, 88, 1, 81, 60):**
   - This item is most valuable to Agent 1. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Item 5 (80, 65, 94, 86, 24):**
   - This item is most valuable to Agent 2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Item 2 (26, 67, 51, 90, 44):**
   - This item is most valuable to Agent 3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Item 4 (60, 49, 94, 19, 54):** 
   - This item is most valuable to Agent 2, but they have already received item 5. The next highest valuation is from Agent 0. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

6. **Item 3 (11, 57, 31, 64, 65):**
   - This item is most valuable to Agent 4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

7. **Item 1 (24, 38, 10, 69, 57):**
   - This item is most valuable to Agent 3, but they have already received item 2. The next highest valuation is from Agent 4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

8. **Item 0 (46, 0, 11, 78, 76):**
   - This item is most valuable to Agent 3, but they have already received item 2. The next highest valuation is from Agent 4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, let's summarize the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their individual highest valuations and attempts to minimize envy among agents.
