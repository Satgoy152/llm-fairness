Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  84  68  60  99  88  52  11
1  73  97  90  30  24  96  24  69
2  28  28  76  97  47  62  95  88
3  36  75  15  93  63  80  57  46
4  78  95  58  52  15  71  58  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free division where each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Let's consider an approach that balances the total value each agent receives, taking into account their valuations. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** Sum the values each agent assigns to all items.

2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Fairness:** Try to allocate items such that each agent receives a comparable total value, minimizing envy.

Let's break it down:

- **Agent 0 Total Value:** \(51 + 84 + 68 + 60 + 99 + 88 + 52 + 11 = 513\)
- **Agent 1 Total Value:** \(73 + 97 + 90 + 30 + 24 + 96 + 24 + 69 = 503\)
- **Agent 2 Total Value:** \(28 + 28 + 76 + 97 + 47 + 62 + 95 + 88 = 521\)
- **Agent 3 Total Value:** \(36 + 75 + 15 + 93 + 63 + 80 + 57 + 46 = 465\)
- **Agent 4 Total Value:** \(78 + 95 + 58 + 52 + 15 + 71 + 58 + 93 = 520\)

**Proposed Allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Items 1, 5 (Total Value: 172)
- **Agent 1:** Items 0, 2 (Total Value: 163)
- **Agent 2:** Items 6, 7 (Total Value: 183)
- **Agent 3:** Items 3, 4 (Total Value: 156)
- **Agent 4:** Item 4 (Total Value: 63)

Assigning items to balance valuations:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 5] (Total valuation: \(84 + 88 = 172\))
- **Agent 1**: [0, 2] (Total valuation: \(73 + 90 = 163\))
- **Agent 2**: [6, 7] (Total valuation: \(95 + 88 = 183\))
- **Agent 3**: [3] (Total valuation: \(93\))
- **Agent 4**: [4] (Total valuation: \(15\))

**Allocation Sum Check:**

Total items allocated: 8 (1+2+2+1+2) = 8 items.

Here's the JSON format for allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences while ensuring every item is allocated.
