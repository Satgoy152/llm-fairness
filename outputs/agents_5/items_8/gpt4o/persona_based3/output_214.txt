Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  46  85  61  83  33  73  38
1  24  26  19  65  44  50  91  85
2  21  64  55  89  94  60  27  97
3   0   7  86   7  80  97  59  81
4  74  34  19  57  94  35  35  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to use a method that ensures envy-freeness or as close as possible, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

One common approach is the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns selecting their most valued remaining item. We will follow a similar approach, adjusted to ensure all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0's allocations**: Agent 0 values item 2 the most (85), followed by item 4 (83), and item 3 (61).

2. **Agent 1's allocations**: Agent 1 values item 6 the most (91), followed by item 7 (85), and item 3 (65).

3. **Agent 2's allocations**: Agent 2 values item 7 the most (97), followed by item 4 (94), and item 3 (89).

4. **Agent 3's allocations**: Agent 3 values item 5 the most (97), followed by item 2 (86), and item 4 (80).

5. **Agent 4's allocations**: Agent 4 values item 4 the most (94), followed by item 0 (74), and item 3 (57).

By iterating through these valuations and allocating the highest valued available item to each agent in turn, we can create a fair division. Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 3 takes item 5 (97).
- Agent 2 takes item 7 (97).
- Agent 1 takes item 6 (91).
- Agent 4 takes item 4 (94).
- Agent 0 takes item 2 (85).

Now we continue with the remaining items:

- Agent 3 takes item 4 (80) (already taken by Agent 4, so Agent 3 takes item 3 which is now available).
- Agent 0 takes item 3 (61).
- Agent 4 takes item 0 (74).
- Agent 1 takes item 1 (26).

After these allocations, all items have been distributed. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents and attempts to respect their preferences as much as possible given the constraint of integer allocations.
