Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  20  42  72  24   1  61  37
1  61  87  10  32  99  73  63  88
2  18   3  85  41   0  77  34  83
3  61  44  65  28  48  96  59  50
4  50  55  43  85   3  85  80  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that considers the agents' valuations and tries to balance the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a method similar to the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or "Max-Min Fairness".

Given the valuations table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 62     | 20     | 42     | 72     | 24     | 1      | 61     | 37     |
| 1     | 61     | 87     | 10     | 32     | 99     | 73     | 63     | 88     |
| 2     | 18     | 3      | 85     | 41     | 0      | 77     | 34     | 83     |
| 3     | 61     | 44     | 65     | 28     | 48     | 96     | 59     | 50     |
| 4     | 50     | 55     | 43     | 85     | 3      | 85     | 80     | 48     |

Let's focus on maximizing the minimum value each agent receives by allocating items iteratively to those who value them the most, while ensuring that no single agent receives a disproportionately high total value compared to others.

Here's one potential fair allocation:

1. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most (99), so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 1** also values item 1 highly (87), allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 3** values item 5 the most (96), so allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (72), so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 highly (43) after considering others' allocations, allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 0** also values item 0 highly (62), allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 4** values item 7 highly (48), so allocate item 7 to Agent 4.
8. **Agent 2** values item 6 the most among remaining items (34), so allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and values are reasonably balanced.
