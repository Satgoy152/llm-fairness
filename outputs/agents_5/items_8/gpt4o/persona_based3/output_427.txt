Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  94  79  39  72  60  12  92
1   7   4  51  51  93  69  48  20
2  57  90  53  14  50  75  20  63
3  31   2  10  45  59  65  96   7
4   0  11  88  59  95  57  33  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free division where each agent receives a bundle of items they value highly relative to their preferences. This means that no agent should prefer another agent's bundle over their own. One approach to achieve this is to use an algorithm like the "round-robin" method or "max-min" allocation.

Let's proceed with a round-robin allocation, where each agent takes turns picking the item they value the most among the remaining items. We'll start with Agent 0 and proceed to Agent 4, and repeat this process until all items are allocated.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 1 (value 94).
   - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 93).
   - Agent 2 picks item 0 (value 57).
   - Agent 3 picks item 6 (value 96).
   - Agent 4 picks item 2 (value 88).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 92).
   - Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 69).
   - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 14).

After these rounds, all 8 items have been allocated. Each agent has received items based on their highest valuation for each round, aiming to minimize envy.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

In this allocation, every agent has received at least one item, and the distribution aims to be as envy-free as possible given the constraints of integer allocations.
