Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  75  30  93  37  13  44  99
1  31   3  85  18  98  76  32   2
2  32  13  17  55  10  75  31  74
3  18  32  47  30  91  26  71  13
4  85   3  54  70   3  59  51  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and distribute the items so that each agent values their allocation highly while ensuring all items are allocated. A common approach is to use an envy-free or approximately envy-free method, such as the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division algorithms. Here, I'll use a heuristic approach to provide a balanced allocation considering the valuations.

First, let's consider the maximum value an agent places on an item and try to allocate high-value items to the agents for whom they are most valuable. We'll aim for each agent to receive at least one item and ensure all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Assign each agent their highest-value item, if possible, without conflicts.
2. Resolve any conflicts by considering the next best option for any agent if another agent has a higher claim.
3. Continue assigning remaining unallocated items, trying to maximize each agent's total valuation.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. Agent 0: Item 7 (value 99)
2. Agent 1: Item 4 (value 98)
3. Agent 2: Item 5 (value 75)
4. Agent 3: Item 4 (value 91), but already assigned to Agent 1, so choose Item 6 (value 71)
5. Agent 4: Item 0 (value 85)

Now, allocate the remaining items 1, 2, 3, which have not been allocated yet:

- Item 1: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (value 75)
- Item 2: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (value 85)
- Item 3: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (value 93), but already have item 7, so assign to next highest, Agent 4 (value 70)

By following this approach, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their received items while ensuring that all items are allocated.
