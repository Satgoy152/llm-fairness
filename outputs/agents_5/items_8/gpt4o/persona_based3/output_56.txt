Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  83  68  37  60  52  50  88
1  34  39  37  75  69  71  43  36
2  60  83  30  85  81  92   6  46
3  41  67  34  51  92  59  43  71
4  53  66  27  47  55  81  71  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives. We will distribute the items in a way that aims to minimize envy and maximize fairness.

First, let's summarize the agents' valuations for each item to identify potential allocations:

- Agent 0: Valuations are [1, 83, 68, 37, 60, 52, 50, 88]
- Agent 1: Valuations are [34, 39, 37, 75, 69, 71, 43, 36]
- Agent 2: Valuations are [60, 83, 30, 85, 81, 92, 6, 46]
- Agent 3: Valuations are [41, 67, 34, 51, 92, 59, 43, 71]
- Agent 4: Valuations are [53, 66, 27, 47, 55, 81, 71, 95]

We can use a round-robin allocation process where each agent selects the item that they value most but hasn't been allocated yet. This process continues until all items have been allocated.

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 7 (value 88)
   - Agent 1 selects item 3 (value 75)
   - Agent 2 selects item 5 (value 92)
   - Agent 3 selects item 4 (value 92)
   - Agent 4 selects item 1 (value 66)

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 selects item 1 (value 83, but it's already taken)
   - Next highest for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 68)
   - Agent 1 selects item 6 (value 71)
   - Agent 2 selects item 0 (value 60, all higher values are taken)
   - Agent 3 selects item 7 (value 71, already taken)
   - Agent 3 then selects item 3 (value 51, already taken)
   - All remaining selections for Agent 3 are taken, so they select item 6 (value 43)
   - Agent 4 selects item 0 (value 53, already taken)
   - Agent 4 selects item 7 (value 95, already taken)
   - Agent 4 selects item 2 (value 27)

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, satisfying the condition that each agent receives an integer number of items.
