Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  63  89  82  43  28  67  86
1  73  44   9  90  13  38  87  97
2  78  80  56  39  92  95  25  86
3  55  44  28  37  26  20  72  11
4  66  40  40  68  36  66  27  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider a method that ensures envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation of items over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness in practice can be challenging, a common approach is to use strategies such as the maximum Nash welfare or the round-robin procedure.

For this scenario, I'll use a simplified method to attempt to balance the allocations based on the given valuations. We aim to give each agent items such that their total valuation is as high as possible compared to what they could have had, while ensuring that all 8 items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 highly (89) and item 0 (85).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 7 highly (97) and item 3 (90).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 highly (95) and item 4 (92).
4. **Agent 3**: Doesn't have any particularly high values compared to others, but item 6 (72) is highest for them.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 highly (68), but it is already taken by Agent 1; hence, consider item 5 (66).

Following this analysis, we allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 3, 7
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 1

This allocation attempts to balance the items considering the highest preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
