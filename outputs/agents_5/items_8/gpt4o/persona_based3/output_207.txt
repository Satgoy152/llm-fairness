Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  92  53  11  42  23  34  27
1  22  18  23  61  94  59  65  82
2  37  84  23   4  26  76  47  24
3  95  42  65  67  58  74  22  76
4  83  74  36  80  18  55  54  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is considered envy-free if no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, based on their valuations. Given the valuations of each agent for each item, we aim to allocate the items such that the perceived value for each agent in their bundle is maximized while ensuring fairness.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 (92) and 0 (37).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (94) and item 7 (82) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 (76) highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 (67) and item 0 (95) highly.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 (80) and item 0 (83) highly.

Attempting to allocate items to maximize satisfaction and minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (92), as it is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 4 (94) and 7 (82), as these are their highest valued items.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 (76), as it is their highest valued item.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 3 (67) and 6 (22), as item 3 is highly valued and item 6 is less contested.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate items 0 (83) and 2 (36), as item 0 is highly valued and item 2 is less contested.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while distributing the items evenly across agents.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items to agents in a manner that attempts to minimize envy and maximize fairness based on the provided valuations.
