Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  32  43  20  91   1  49  70
1  11  51  97   9  96  43  16  54
2  33  45  44  26  19  42  86  63
3  84  57  68  67  35   4  73  15
4  42  76  79  22  69  40   2  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-free allocation of the items among the five agents based on their valuations, we can use a method such as the Envy-Free algorithm. However, given the discrete nature of the problem and the requirement that each agent must receive an integer number of items, we will aim for a balanced allocation that minimizes envy.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Identify the total number of items:** There are 8 items to be allocated.
2. **Calculate the number of items per agent:** With 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive 2 items and others will receive 1 item. Specifically, 3 agents will receive 2 items each, and 2 agents will receive 1 item each.

Using the valuations provided, we will attempt to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, minimizing the potential for envy.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 0 (value 80), 1 (value 32)
- **Agent 1:** Items 2 (value 97), 4 (value 96)
- **Agent 2:** Item 6 (value 86)
- **Agent 3:** Items 3 (value 67), 5 (value 4)
- **Agent 4:** Item 7 (value 19)

This allocation attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuations in a way that aims to minimize envy and fairly distribute the items.
