Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  13  32  65  58  95  91  74
1  31  30  62  96  51  26  71  67
2  96  35  62  38  98  88  83  13
3  97  21  87  71  66  32  88  53
4  52  34   9   0  63   5  77  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should aim to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation relative to others. This can be quite complex, but one approach is to use a round-robin or sequential allocation method where agents take turns choosing items based on their preferences until all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to find an allocation that seems fair:

1. **Agent 0** values item 5 (95) and item 6 (91) highly.
2. **Agent 1** values item 3 (96) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 (98) highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 (97) highly.
5. **Agent 4** values item 7 (94) highly.

Given these high-value items, let's try to allocate these first to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0** takes item 5.
- **Agent 1** takes item 3.
- **Agent 2** takes item 4.
- **Agent 3** takes item 0.
- **Agent 4** takes item 7.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We have 3 more items to allocate: items 1, 2, and 6. Let's allocate these based on remaining preferences:

- **Agent 0** can also take item 6 (second highest for them after 5).
- **Agent 1** can take item 2 (next highest value after 3).
- **Agent 2** can take item 1 (next highest value after 4).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one of their top-valued items, and all 8 items are distributed. Here's the finalized allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7]
}
```
