Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  23  28  21  43  23  10  64
1  65  28  93  55  71  46  89  54
2  68  76  69  65  99  17  27  96
3  35  77  64  17  85  71  19  58
4  84  43  42  61  46  39  33   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to allocate the items such that envy among agents is minimized. A simple approach, given the constraints of integer allocations, is to use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of the utilities of the agents. However, considering the complexity and constraints, we'll aim for a balanced allocation prioritizing high individual valuations while ensuring a fair distribution of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are relatively low compared to others, but they value item 7 highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Values items 2 and 6 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 4 and 7.
4. **Agent 3**: Values items 1 and 4 highly.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 highly.

Based on these observations, here's one potential allocation:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (highest value for item 7).
- Assign items 2 and 6 to Agent 1 (highest values for items 2 and 6).
- Assign items 4 and 3 to Agent 2 (high total value for these items, with 4 being the highest).
- Assign items 1 and 5 to Agent 3 (high value for item 1 and reasonable for 5).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (highest value for item 0).

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences, maximizing individual satisfaction.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [0]
}
```
