Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  95  89  14  81  64  34  92
1  35  82  15  51  41  23  31  72
2  49  69  97  20  44  17  71  66
3  33  44  70  84  96  79  24   6
4  88  37  15  59  69  36  24  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[55 95 89 14 81 64 34 92]
 [35 82 15 51 41 23 31 72]
 [49 69 97 20 44 17 71 66]
 [33 44 70 84 96 79 24  6]
 [88 37 15 59 69 36 24 78]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and try to achieve envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that they have received a fair share according to their preferences.

Given the valuations table, let's analyze the items and agents:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 1 (95) and item 7 (92) highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 1 (82) and item 7 (72) highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 2 (97) and item 6 (71) highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 4 (96) and item 5 (79) highly.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 0 (88) and item 7 (78) highly.

To enforce fairness, we need to ensure each agent receives items they value highly, without causing significant envy among others. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 1 and 7. This gives agent 0 two of their highest-valued items.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3. This item does not overlap with agent 1's top choices, but it helps balance the allocation because agent 1's top choices are also highly valued by others.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2. This is agent 2's highest-valued item.
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 4 and 5. These are two of agent 3's highly valued items.
- **Agent 4**: Assign items 0 and 6. These items are also highly valued by agent 4, with item 0 being the highest.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value, while also considering the preferences of others to maintain a balance of fairness.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```
