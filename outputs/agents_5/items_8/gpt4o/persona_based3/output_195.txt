Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13   8  34   9  28  60  44  91
1  99  74   1  89  48  47  34  66
2  83  27   3  34  79  40   6  87
3  46  83  37  23  90   5  29  22
4  11  31  96  65  19  93  47   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we need to consider the agents' valuations and aim for an envy-free allocation where possible. Each agent should receive an integer number of items, and we need to allocate all 8 items.

Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify high valuations**: Look for items where agents have significantly higher valuations than others. This could be a starting point for allocating items to agents who value them the most.

2. **Balance total value**: Try to ensure that the total value of items allocated to each agent is as balanced as possible.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Make sure all 8 items are allocated to the agents.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has a very high valuation for item 7. 
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 3 highly values item 4, but since it's already allocated, let's consider other items.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 2.

Allocating based on these observations:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation among remaining items).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (highest valuation).
- Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1, 5, and 6.

Balancing the remaining items:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 due to the next highest valuation.
- Agent 1 gets item 5, which they value more than the remaining agents.
- Agent 2 gets item 6 since it balances their total value.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the relative valuations and ensure that each agent's allocation is fair and balanced according to their preferences.
