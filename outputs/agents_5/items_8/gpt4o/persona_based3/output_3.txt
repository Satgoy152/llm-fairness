Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  59  54  33   5  87  19  48
1   6  62  52  65  70  11  59  38
2  75  49  64   3  35  66  15   5
3  29  55  53  98  87  84  82  42
4  32  18  65  12  26  50  65  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we can use a method like the round-robin allocation or a max-min fair allocation approach. However, since the problem is of a smaller scale, we can manually evaluate and allocate based on the highest valuations in a way that aims to minimize envy.

First, let's determine the total number of items and agents involved:
- Number of agents: 5 (0 through 4)
- Number of items: 8 (0 through 7)

Next, let's proceed with the allocation by considering each agent's preferences based on their valuations. We aim to allocate items in a way that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (Value: 87)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (Value: 70)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (Value: 75)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (Value: 98)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (Value: 65)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

6. **Remaining Items:** 1, 6, 7

   Let's distribute them to minimize envy and ensure all items are allocated.

7. **Agent 0:** Already has 1 item, evaluate for next high valuation.
   - Next highest: Item 1 (Value: 59)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

8. **Agent 1:** Already has 1 item, evaluate for next high valuation.
   - Next highest: Item 6 (Value: 59)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

9. **Agent 3:** Already has 1 item, evaluate for next high valuation.
   - Highest remaining: Item 7 (Value: 42)
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Now, each agent has been allocated items based on their highest preferences, striving for an envy-free allocation. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```
