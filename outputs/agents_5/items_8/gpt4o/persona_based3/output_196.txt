Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  50  39  62  77  28  24  26
1  94  50  46  76  62  73   5  37
2  17  80  47  68  99  10  27  35
3  35  12  90  73  80  55  68  17
4  83   4  85  20  15  21   9  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we'll consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share given their preferences. We'll aim to balance the total value of items allocated to each agent as closely as possible based on their valuations.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - For Agent 0: 89 + 50 + 39 + 62 + 77 + 28 + 24 + 26 = 395
   - For Agent 1: 94 + 50 + 46 + 76 + 62 + 73 + 5 + 37 = 443
   - For Agent 2: 17 + 80 + 47 + 68 + 99 + 10 + 27 + 35 = 383
   - For Agent 3: 35 + 12 + 90 + 73 + 80 + 55 + 68 + 17 = 430
   - For Agent 4: 83 + 4 + 85 + 20 + 15 + 21 + 9 + 35 = 272

2. **Allocate Items to Balance Valuations:**
   - Start by assigning high-value items to the agents who value them the most.
   - Ensure each agent has at least one item if possible.

3. **Initial Assignments Based on Maximum Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 1 (Value 94)
   - Item 1: Agent 2 (Value 80)
   - Item 2: Agent 3 (Value 90)
   - Item 3: Agent 1 (Value 76)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (Value 99)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (Value 73)
   - Item 6: Agent 3 (Value 68)
   - Item 7: Agent 4 (Value 35)

4. **Check and Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Ensure each agent gets a fair share according to their total valuation.
   - Reallocate to balance overall satisfaction.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0] (Total Value: 89)
   - Agent 1: [3, 5] (Total Value: 149)
   - Agent 2: [1, 4] (Total Value: 179)
   - Agent 3: [2, 6] (Total Value: 158)
   - Agent 4: [7] (Total Value: 35)

This allocation ensures a more balanced distribution of total value across agents, given their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
