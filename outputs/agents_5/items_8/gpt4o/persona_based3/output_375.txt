Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  97  12  36  39   3  40  75
1  83  60  67  48  54  66   7  47
2  12   6   1  48  97  47  43  78
3  79  31  55   8  36  28  81   8
4  12  69   4  56  73  85  55  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given the constraints. The goal is to allocate all 8 items to the 5 agents in a way that minimizes envy and maximizes fairness based on their valuations.

First, let's consider the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 2 + 97 + 12 + 36 + 39 + 3 + 40 + 75 = 304
- Agent 1: 83 + 60 + 67 + 48 + 54 + 66 + 7 + 47 = 432
- Agent 2: 12 + 6 + 1 + 48 + 97 + 47 + 43 + 78 = 332
- Agent 3: 79 + 31 + 55 + 8 + 36 + 28 + 81 + 8 = 326
- Agent 4: 12 + 69 + 4 + 56 + 73 + 85 + 55 + 77 = 431

Next, we consider how to allocate items to maximize each agent's satisfaction by primarily allocating high-value items to agents who value them the most.

1. **Item 1** (highest value by Agent 0): Assign to Agent 0.
2. **Item 4** (highest value by Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2.
3. **Item 0** (highest value by Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
4. **Item 5** (highest value by Agent 4): Assign to Agent 4.
5. **Item 7** (highest value by Agent 2): Assign to Agent 2.
6. **Item 6** (highest value by Agent 3): Assign to Agent 3.
7. **Item 3** (highest value by Agent 1): Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 2** (remaining item): Assign to Agent 3.

This allocation aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them their most valued items, subject to the constraint that each agent should get at least one item.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [6, 2],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to cater to each agent's highest preference, given the constraints.
