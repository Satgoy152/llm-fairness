Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  74   6  53  51  89  14  25
1  40  47  50  35  42  26  59  56
2  50  65  14  29  48  15  22  59
3  63   0  17  32  15  92  78  92
4  24  55  74  20  86   7  38  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a greedy approach based on the valuations provided. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: Start by creating empty allocations for each agent.
2. **Greedy Allocation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are allocated.
3. **Verification**: Ensure that the allocations respect the constraints of giving an integer number of items to each agent and that the total number of items allocated is 8.

### Allocation Steps:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 50 by agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 74 by agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 74 by agent 4.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 53 by agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 86 by agent 4.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 92 by agent 3.
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 78 by agent 3.
- **Item 7**: Highest value is 92 by agent 3.

### Final Allocations

Based on the steps above, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 6, 7],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items based on their highest valuation.
