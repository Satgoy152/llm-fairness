Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  27  47  40   3  87   5  85
1   0  62  25   5  49  30  15  23
2  44  39  65  72  47  35   2  44
3  95  98  60  41  48  85  95  53
4  23  22  89  16  42  96  90  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can consider the valuations of each agent for each item. We want to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. A possible approach is to use the Envy-Free (EF) allocation principle.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how we can achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
    - We have 5 agents and 8 items.
    - We want each agent to get an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated.

2. **Valuations Analysis**:
    - Look at the preferences (valuations) of each agent.
    - We should prioritize giving agents items they value highly, while ensuring overall fairness.

3. **Allocation Strategy**:
    - Start by giving each agent one of their most valued items.
    - Then, allocate the remaining items by looking at the remaining highest valuations for each agent, trying to balance total valuations among agents.

4. **Implementation**:
    - This strategy aims for each agent to receive a fair share based on their valuations.
    - We will iterate over the items and assign them to agents in such a way that maximizes the perceived fairness.

Based on this strategy, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [5, 7] (valuations: 87, 85).
- Agent 1 receives items [1] (valuation: 62).
- Agent 2 receives items [3] (valuation: 72).
- Agent 3 receives items [0, 6] (valuations: 95, 95).
- Agent 4 receives items [2, 4] (valuations: 89, 42).

This allocation tries to balance the total perceived value each agent receives, while also considering their individual preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
