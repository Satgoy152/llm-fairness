Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  17  36  58  37  64  10   5
1   8  78  88  33   4  57  39  84
2  90  16  20  60  11  42  26  79
3  60  24  42  59  90  64  76  62
4  48  18  54  91  95  39  67  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 78 88 33  4 57 39 84]
 [90 16 20 60 11 42 26 79]

 [48 18 54 91 95 39 67 43]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division where each agent receives an integer number of items, we can aim for an envy-free allocation as much as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations in the table, let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy. Here is one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2 and item 7.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 but it is already allocated; the next highest is item 7, but it is also taken, so we consider items 3 and 5.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 highly.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 highly but it is taken, so we consider item 6.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0
- **Agent 1**: Items 2, 7
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 4
- **Agent 4**: Items 1, 3, 6

This allocation ensures each agent gets a proportionate share of the items based on their preferences as much as possible.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 3, 6]
}
```
