Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  31  40  61  40  74  39  10
1  55  18  15  33  57  62  40  54
2  69  44  42  55  31  99  62   6
3  83  94  24  47  73  47  42  48
4  40  60  30  35  36  87  43   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum satisfaction or using a method like the Adjusted Winner Procedure or similar heuristic approaches. Given the valuations, we aim to distribute the items in a way that balances the perceived value across all agents.

Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:** Sum the values of all items for each agent to understand their total valuation.
2. **Initial Allocation:** Start by giving each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no conflicts initially.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Adjust the allocation iteratively to balance the remaining items, checking for potential envy or significant dissatisfaction.

Let's run through the allocation process:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 357
   - Agent 1: 334
   - Agent 2: 408
   - Agent 3: 458
   - Agent 4: 332

2. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Value:**
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (74).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (62).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the most (99).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (94).
   - Agent 4 values item 5 the most (87).

3. **Resolving Conflicts and Allocating Remaining Items:**
   - Multiple agents want item 5, so we allocate it to Agent 2 who values it the most (99).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 directly (94).
   - Find next highest values for other agents avoiding conflicts:

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Allocate items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Allocate items 4, 7
- Agent 2: Allocate items 5
- Agent 3: Allocate items 1, 6
- Agent 4: Allocate items 2

This allocation ensures each agent gets items according to their highest preferences while distributing all 8 items.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations and minimize envy among agents.
