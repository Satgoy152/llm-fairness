Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  49  82  23  10   1  51  47
1  39  97  32  49  48  47  32  65
2  18  34   5  37  78  59   6  98
3   0  43  60  96  36  90  44   6
4   7  73  83  46  65  23  24  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the five agents, we need to consider a method that aims for envy-freeness while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Considering the valuations provided, a strategy is to allocate items to maximize each agent's valuation while ensuring that no agent feels envious of another's allocation. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 2 and 6.
- Agent 1 highly values item 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 7.
- Agent 3 highly values item 3.
- Agent 4 highly values item 4 and item 5.

Based on these observations, we can make the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 6]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [7]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4, 5, 0]

This allocation tries to optimize each agentâ€™s satisfaction, given their valuations, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5, 0]
}
```
