Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  31  97  94  95  36  87  49
1  78  87  88  57  16  13  92  22
2  70  46  48  24  33  78  67  43
3  44  76   9  25  48  85  13  87
4  16   3  93  98  80  52  94  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. This means each agent should prefer their allocation or be indifferent to others' allocations. Given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items, we consider both the distribution of items and the maximization of each agent's satisfaction.

One approach is to use a method like "round-robin" or "max-min" allocation, where we iteratively allocate the most valued item that hasn't been allocated yet to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring a fair distribution across agents.

Let's begin the allocation process:

1. **Determine Highest Valuation:** Identify the highest unallocated item value for any agent and allocate it to that agent.
2. **Repeat:** Continue until all items are allocated, ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items.

Following this approach, here's how the allocation could be structured:

- **Agent 4** gets item 3 (value 98) and item 2 (value 93).
- **Agent 1** gets item 2 (value 88) since agent 4 already got it, so we compensate with item 0 (value 78).
- **Agent 0** gets item 4 (value 95) and item 3 (value 94).
- **Agent 3** gets item 5 (value 85) and item 7 (value 87).
- **Agent 2** gets item 6 (value 67).

Let's allocate the items based on this analysis:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This configuration ensures that each agent gets at least one item while maximizing their perceived value based on their individual valuations.
