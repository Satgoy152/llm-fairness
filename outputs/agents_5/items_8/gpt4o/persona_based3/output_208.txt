Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  57  35  41   1  15  99  75
1   9  74  84   0   4  17  50  39
2  29  10  27  94  65  40  48  44
3  36  89  81  86  70  23  53   7
4  30  66  38  26  87  42  20   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as they value the allocation given to any other agent. Given the valuations provided, we aim for a distribution where each agent receives items that maximize their personal valuations while minimizing envy.

Letâ€™s proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 6 the highest at 99. We will allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 84. We will allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 94. We will allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 89. We will allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 4 the highest at 87. We will allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items and need to allocate the remaining 3 items (0, 5, 7):

6. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 at 86. We will allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 5 at 23, which is the highest among the remaining unallocated items. We will allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
8. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 7 at 75. We will allocate item 7 to Agent 0 to maximize their utility.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, while attempting to minimize envy among the agents.
