Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  10   8  75  36   7  36  42
1  89  19  17  83   8  65   9   1
2   3  82  33  59  51  92  78  11
3  62  88  97  56  42   0  39  57
4  50  92  75  21  99  49  61  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, we can employ a method like "round-robin" or "max-min." However, since the goal is to ensure fairness and envy-freeness, we should try to maximize the minimum value that an agent can get and avoid any agent envying another.

In this specific scenario, we can try to allocate items by ensuring each agent is happy with their allocation according to their valuations. An optimal allocation won't necessarily be perfectly envy-free due to the discrete nature and the specific valuations, but we can aim to minimize envy and maximize perceived fairness.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: We allocate items that maximize their value but try to avoid allocations that would make others envious beyond their allocations.
2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, allocate items that maximize their satisfaction while considering other agents' preferences.
3. **Agent 2**, **Agent 3**, and **Agent 4**: Follow the same principle.

After considering the valuations, here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This distribution attempts to balance the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Each agent receives items that are of significant value to them, thereby minimizing envy. Note that perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable, but this allocation seeks to be as fair as possible given the constraints.
