Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30   8  13  80  19  44  45  13
1  37  61  75  53  19  94  50  73
2  29  85  17  53  80  76  18  55
3  41  31  74  47  77  33  42  10
4  89  62  78   2  15  64  44  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we'll aim to ensure each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly. We need to consider each agent's preferences and distribute the items such that no agent feels envious of another's allocation.

Here is a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (80), so we start by allocating item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (94), so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (85), so we allocate item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (74), so we allocate item 2 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (89), so we allocate item 0 to agent 4.

After allocating each agent one highly valued item, we continue to allocate the remaining items to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives a bundle they value reasonably well.

- Agent 1 also values item 7 (73), so we allocate item 7 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 also values item 4 (80), so we allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 also values item 6 (42), so we allocate item 6 to agent 3.

This allocation strategy attempts to give each agent at least one item they highly value and distributes the remaining items to balance the overall perceived fairness.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
