Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  39  66  85  54  22  86  57  11
1  93  52  11  36   4  61  84  12
2  14  89  68  85  96  80  48   9
3  56  45  81  88  41  26  47  30
4  53  14  55  17  55  78  85  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. One common approach to achieve this is the "Envy-Free" allocation, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as the allocation of any other agent according to their own valuation.

Let's assess the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 39 + 66 + 85 + 54 + 22 + 86 + 57 + 11 = 420
- Agent 1: 93 + 52 + 11 + 36 + 4 + 61 + 84 + 12 = 353
- Agent 2: 14 + 89 + 68 + 85 + 96 + 80 + 48 + 9 = 489
- Agent 3: 56 + 45 + 81 + 88 + 41 + 26 + 47 + 30 = 414
- Agent 4: 53 + 14 + 55 + 17 + 55 + 78 + 85 + 83 = 360

We can assign items such that each agent receives a portion of the items they value highly, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated is exactly 8 and that the allocation is as envy-free as possible.

Based on the item values and trying to match items with agents who value them highly, here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 5] (Values: 85, 86)
- Agent 1: [0] (Value: 93)
- Agent 2: [4] (Value: 96)
- Agent 3: [3, 6] (Values: 88, 47)
- Agent 4: [1, 7] (Values: 14, 83)

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, reducing potential envy. The total number of items allocated is 8, as required.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```
