Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  94  76  37  73  89  99  80
1  35  83   4  20   6  62  98   1
2  33  94  23  53  30  44  11  46
3  13  98  79  26  67  93  77  48
4  20  40   5  13  17  47  55  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to satisfy envy-freeness as much as possible while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to allocate all 8 items in a way that minimizes envy, which means each agent should value their bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle, if possible.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Look for items that have significantly higher valuations for specific agents compared to others. This can help in reducing envy for those agents.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items:** Start by allocating items to agents who value them the most, especially if their valuation is significantly higher than other agents' valuations for the same item.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:** After allocating high-value items, distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's implement this process:

- **Agent 0:** Highly values item 6 (99) and item 1 (94).
- **Agent 1:** Highly values item 6 (98) and item 5 (62).
- **Agent 2:** Highly values item 1 (94).
- **Agent 3:** Highly values item 1 (98) and item 5 (93).
- **Agent 4:** No significantly high valuations compared to others.

Allocate items as follows:

1. **Agent 0** gets item 6 (99).
2. **Agent 1** gets item 5 (62) and item 7 (1).
3. **Agent 2** gets item 1 (94).
4. **Agent 3** gets item 3 (26).
5. **Agent 4** gets item 4 (17).

Distribute remaining items (0, 2):

- **Agent 0** also gets item 0 (22).
- **Agent 3** gets item 2 (79).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving agents items they value highly while ensuring each agent receives items and all items are distributed.
