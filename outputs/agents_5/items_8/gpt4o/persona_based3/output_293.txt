Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  56  50  17  12  68  65  79
1  21  89  15  32  96  18  42  63
2  73  20  15  32  16  43  11   0
3  11  45  62  52  68  23   7  93
4  54  45  52  13  68  98  93  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a modified version of the envy-free algorithm that tries to balance the perceived values each agent receives. Given the valuations, one approach is to iteratively allocate the most preferred available item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring that this allocation remains fair and envy-free as much as possible.

Let's proceed with such an allocation:

1. Start by listing the items each agent values the most and allocate if no conflict exists.
2. Resolve conflicts by comparing values and allocating to the agent with the highest valuation.
3. Continue until all items are allocated.

Following this procedure, we get the following allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (79), and no other agent values it higher, so assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (96), and no other agent values it higher, so assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (73), and no other agent values it higher, so assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the highest, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 3 (52), but Agent 1 also wants it (32), so assign item 3 to Agent 3 because they value it more.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest (98), and no other agent values it higher, so assign item 5 to Agent 4.
- Items left are 1, 2, and 6.

For the remaining items:
- Item 1 is valued the highest by Agent 1 (89), so allocate it to Agent 1.
- Item 2 is valued the highest by Agent 3 (62), so allocate it to Agent 3.
- Item 6 is valued the highest by Agent 4 (93), so allocate it to Agent 4.

After following this process, we achieve the following fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```
