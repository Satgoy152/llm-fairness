Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  31  34  85  54  33  31  35
1  89  61  99  70  12  90  42   8
2  57  74   1   4  40  30  93  65
3  24  23  48  33  75  53  26  13
4  31  26  35  26  47  12  96  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent feels they received a fair share of the items based on their own valuations. Given the constraints, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

To achieve envy-freeness, we will follow an approximate method, since exact envy-freeness can be computationally difficult with integer items and varying valuations. Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items combined. This helps identify which agent values the entire set of items the most.

2. **Allocate the Highest Valued Items**: Start by allocating the highest valued items to each agent based on their valuations. This step ensures that each agent gets at least one item they highly value.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items**: Once each agent has at least one item, distribute the remaining items in a way that tries to balance the total value each agent receives. This step helps in achieving an approximate envy-free distribution.

4. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Ensure that exactly 8 items are allocated and each item is assigned to one agent.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- **Agent 0**: High valuation for item 3 (85).
- **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 2 (99).
- **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 6 (93).
- **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 4 (75).
- **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 6 (96), which is already taken by agent 2, so next high is item 4 (47).

Now distribute the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations and balancing the total value:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 (50), 3 (85)
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (99)
- **Agent 2**: Items 6 (93), 7 (65)
- **Agent 3**: Items 4 (75), 5 (53)
- **Agent 4**: Items 1 (26)

Now let's verify the total allocations and ensure each agent has at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 3]
- **Agent 1**: [2]
- **Agent 2**: [6, 7]
- **Agent 3**: [4, 5]
- **Agent 4**: [1]

The allocation respects the rule of distributing 8 items, and each agent has at least one item. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
