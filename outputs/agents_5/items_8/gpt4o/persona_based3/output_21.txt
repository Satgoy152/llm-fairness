Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54   2  43  69  44   8  12  96
1  71   3  82  13  81  59  60  10
2  59  13  26  67  92  20  66  91
3  67  88   7  92  65  82  61  73
4   4  94  69  25  57  99  89  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to minimize the envy each agent feels towards others by ensuring that each agent prefers their own bundle of items over others'. Given the valuations, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation. Here's a plausible allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent should receive approximately 1.6 items, but since items are indivisible and we have exactly 8 items, some agents will receive 2 items, and others will receive 1.
   - We aim to allocate items so that the total valuation for each agent is balanced, reducing the potential for envy.

2. **Allocations:**
   - Allocate items in such a way that each agent receives a bundle that they value highly relative to what is available.

3. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring no agent receives more than 2 items.

4. **Detailed Allocation:**
   - **Agent 0:** Receive items 0 and 7 (valuations: 54 and 96).
   - **Agent 1:** Receive items 2 and 4 (valuations: 82 and 81).
   - **Agent 2:** Receive items 6 and 3 (valuations: 66 and 67).
   - **Agent 3:** Receive items 5 (valuation: 82).
   - **Agent 4:** Receive items 1 (valuation: 94).

5. **Check for Total Allocation:**
   - Each item is assigned, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation is constructed with the goal of balancing total value across agents while minimizing potential envy, and ensuring that each agent is satisfied with their bundle relative to others.
