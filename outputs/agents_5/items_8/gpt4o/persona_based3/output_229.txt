Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  11  94  21  40  87  77  94
1  83   7  32  24  15  67  25   9
2  59  73  63  68  30  17  57  64
3  28  49  50  11   6  33   6  22
4  79  45  29   2  95  17  19  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while attempting to maintain envy-freeness, we can use a method like the "maximum weighted matching" in a bipartite graph representation. However, given the simplicity required in this response, I'll manually allocate the items to approximate fairness. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent has a significant advantage over others based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 and 7 highly (94 each).
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the most (83).
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 1 (73).
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 and 1 (50 and 49, respectively).
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the most (95).

Based on these valuations, we'll attempt to distribute the items in a way that tries to respect the highest preferences while distributing the items fairly:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items [2, 7] (high preference for both 94).
- **Agent 1**: Gets item [0] (highest preference for 83).
- **Agent 2**: Gets item [1] (high preference for 73).
- **Agent 3**: Gets items [3, 5] (relatively equal value for item 3 and 5).
- **Agent 4**: Gets items [4, 6] (highest preference for item 4 and moderate for item 6).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and tries to respect their highest valuation preferences as much as possible. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation respects the condition that only and at least 8 items are allocated in total.
