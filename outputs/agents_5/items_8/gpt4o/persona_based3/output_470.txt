Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  73  97  72  74  34   1   3
1  41  90  47  39  61  56  51  13
2  40  57  51  83   3  77  35  77
3  15  12  35  69  31  61  99  43
4  73  47  71  30  35  29  78  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the 5 agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A common approach is to use an algorithm like the adjusted winner procedure, though in this discrete setting, we'll aim for each agent to feel they have received a fair share based on their valuations. 

Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in discrete settings, we'll aim for a reasonable distribution where each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (97), Item 0 (94), Item 1 (73)
   - Allocate Item 2 (97) and Item 0 (94) to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (90), Item 4 (61)
   - Allocate Item 1 (90) and Item 4 (61) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (83), Item 5 (77)
   - Allocate Item 3 (83) and Item 5 (77) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (99)
   - Allocate Item 6 (99) to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (45)
   - Allocate Item 7 (45) to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and items are allocated based on the highest valuations to maximize perceived fairness.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
