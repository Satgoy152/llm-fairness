Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11   8  93  31  46  13  32  19
1  46  74  88  50  17   0  37  24
2   0  43  17  91  29  13  64  45
3  71  24  32  78  91  14  78  18
4  51  34  62  81  89  20   6  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One approach is to use a round-robin method, where agents take turns selecting the most valuable item available to them. This method, while not always perfectly envy-free, typically results in a fair distribution.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0** starts by selecting item 2 (value 93).
2. **Agent 1** selects item 1 (value 74).
3. **Agent 2** selects item 3 (value 91).
4. **Agent 3** selects item 4 (value 91).
5. **Agent 4** selects item 7 (value 99).

After the first round, we have used 5 items, leaving items 0, 5, and 6 unallocated.

6. **Agent 0** selects item 6 (value 32).
7. **Agent 1** selects item 0 (value 46).
8. **Agent 2** selects item 5 (value 13).

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 0
- Agent 2: Items 3, 5
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 7

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their preferences and attempts to minimize envy.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7]
}
```
