Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  20  86   2  24  37  29  61
1  93  96  18  84  61  72  22  93
2  24  16  12  38  27  28  51  68
3  73  46  24  39  17  34  92  63
4  39  37  70  73  27  63  78  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their satisfaction, while also attempting to minimize envy. One method to achieve this is using the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that any envy an agent might have towards another's allocation can be eliminated by removing a single item from the envied allocation.

Given the valuations, we need to distribute the 8 items among the 5 agents. To achieve fairness, we can use a round-robin method based on the highest valuations for items. Let's proceed by allocating the items step by step:

1. Agent 1 highly values item 1 and item 7 (both 93), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 highly values item 2 (86), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 3 highly values item 6 (92), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
4. Agent 4 highly values item 5 (63), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
5. Agent 2 highly values item 7 (68), so we allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
6. We return to Agent 1 who highly values item 3 (84), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
7. Agent 0 has item 0 left as a high valuation (74), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
8. Agent 4 has item 4 left as a high valuation (27), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and it attempts to respect the preferences based on their valuations, striving for an EF1 distribution. Agent 4 receives two items due to their relatively balanced valuation across items, allowing for a fairer distribution among the other agents.
