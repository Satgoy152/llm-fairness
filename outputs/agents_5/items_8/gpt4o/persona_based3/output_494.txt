Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  44  59  55  97  95  62  73
1  92  61  58  26  91  16  22  12
2  91  71  67  99  89  92  10  78
3  94  48  91  21  38  34   1  58
4  83  79  33  98  13  95  30  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we should try to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. In an envy-free allocation, each agent should feel that their own allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their valuation.

To start, we will aim to distribute items so that each agent receives at least one item that they highly value compared to others, to reduce envy. We will also ensure that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Below is the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valued item is item 4 (value 97).
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued item is item 0 (value 92).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued item is item 3 (value 99).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valued item is item 0, but it's taken. The next highest is item 2 (value 91).
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valued item is item 3, but it's taken. The next highest is item 5 (value 95).
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 4.

Now, some items remain unallocated: 1, 6, and 7.

6. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it highly (71), allocate to agent 2.
   - Item 6: Agent 0 values it highly (62), allocate to agent 0.
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it highly (78), allocate to agent 2.

Now each item is allocated, and we have ensured that the distribution is as fair as possible based on the given valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 1, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```
