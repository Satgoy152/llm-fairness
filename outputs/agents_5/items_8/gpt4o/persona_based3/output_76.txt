Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  34  78  13  22  56  77  73
1  37  48  34  21  58  86   3  45
2  49  80  23  26  24  31   4  23
3  74  35   1  35  20  61  25  69
4  62  24  66  97  55  77  24  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an algorithm that aims for envy-freeness and efficiency. A common approach is to use the "Round Robin" method, where agents take turns choosing the most valuable remaining item according to their preference. Here’s how we can implement this:

1. **Initialization**: Each agent starts with no items.
2. **Agent Order**: Choose an order for agents to select items. For simplicity, we'll use the order 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
3. **Selection Process**: Each agent, in turn, selects their most-valued item that hasn’t been taken yet.
4. **Repeat**: Continue the process until all items are allocated.

Now, let's carry out the allocation process:

- **Round 1**:
  - Agent 0 selects item 2 (value 78).
  - Agent 1 selects item 5 (value 86).
  - Agent 2 selects item 1 (value 80).
  - Agent 3 selects item 0 (value 74).
  - Agent 4 selects item 3 (value 97).

- **Round 2**:
  - Agent 0 selects item 6 (value 77).
  - Agent 1 selects item 4 (value 58).
  - Agent 2 selects item 7 (value 23).

This allocation ensures that each agent selects items based on their highest valuation, reducing the potential for envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```
