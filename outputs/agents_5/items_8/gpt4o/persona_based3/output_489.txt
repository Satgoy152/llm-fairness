Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  63  43  36  99  37  22  96
1  45  27  13  42  11  65  61  32
2  74  73  12  65  72  15  57  64
3   5  52  28  71  94  71  79   6
4  47  80  33  56  24   7  40  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should consider ensuring that each agent receives items in a way that minimizes envy. This often involves considering each agent's valuation of items and aiming to distribute items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share relative to their valuations.

One common approach is to use the "envy-free" criterion, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity of achieving exact envy-freeness, especially with integer allocations and a small number of items, we will aim for a balanced distribution that approximates fairness as closely as possible.

Let's examine the values:

|   | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|---|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0 | 35 | 63 | 43 | 36 | 99 | 37 | 22 | 96 |
| 1 | 45 | 27 | 13 | 42 | 11 | 65 | 61 | 32 |
| 2 | 74 | 73 | 12 | 65 | 72 | 15 | 57 | 64 |
| 3 | 5  | 52 | 28 | 71 | 94 | 71 | 79 | 6  |
| 4 | 47 | 80 | 33 | 56 | 24 | 7  | 40 | 69 |

We'll aim to allocate items to maximize the total value each agent receives, while also considering a balanced distribution of items.

**Allocation Strategy:**

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 4 (99) and 7 (96).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 5 (65).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 0 (74) and 1 (73).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 4 (94) and 6 (79).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers items 1 (80) and 7 (69).

To ensure every agent gets a fair share and to avoid envy as much as possible, we distribute the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Get item 4.
- **Agent 1**: Get item 5.
- **Agent 2**: Get items 0 and 1.
- **Agent 3**: Get item 6.
- **Agent 4**: Get items 2, 3, and 7.

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution so that each agent receives items that are among their top preferences, while also considering their total valuation.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
