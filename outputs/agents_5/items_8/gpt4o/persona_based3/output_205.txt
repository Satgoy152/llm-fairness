Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  49  52  94  47  87  60  12
1  30   6  41  10  78  31  91  72
2  84  17  10  29  39  83   9  16
3  86  11  45  25  59  10   1   8
4  93  75  87  22  51  15   5  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and envy-free allocation of the items among the agents, we first need to ensure that each agent values their allocation at least as much as the allocation of any other agent (to the greatest extent possible). Since this is a computationally challenging problem, we can aim for a solution that seeks to balance the total value received by each agent, given their preferences.

Let's analyze the situation and perform a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest at 94, then item 0 at 90.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest at 91, then item 4 at 78.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest at 84, then item 5 at 83.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest at 86, but this is already highly valued by others.
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the highest at 93, then item 2 at 87.

First, we allocate items to satisfy the highest preferences:

- **Item 3** to Agent 0 (value 94).
- **Item 6** to Agent 1 (value 91).
- **Item 5** to Agent 2 (value 83).
- **Item 0** to Agent 4 (value 93).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution and reduce envy:

- **Item 1** to Agent 4 (value 75), as they have a high valuation for it.
- **Item 2** to Agent 4 (value 87), as they have a high valuation for it.
- **Item 4** to Agent 3 (value 59), as it is the highest available for them.
- **Item 7** to Agent 1 (value 72), as it is the next highest for them.

This allocation seeks to distribute the items such that agents receive items they value highly, while minimizing potential envy. Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 1, 2]
}
```
