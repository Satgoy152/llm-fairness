Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83   4  24   7  70  28  17  16
1  41  29  71  23  38  79  50  70
2  27  72  66  29  35  49  53  51
3  59  94  65   3  14  77  37  25
4  53  57  87  78   9  93  54  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's allocation is as envy-free as possible given the valuations. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own based on their individual valuations.

Given the valuations table, we will try to distribute the items with the goal of maximizing each agent's satisfaction with their allocation and minimizing envy. Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. We will attempt to achieve a balanced distribution of items while taking into account each agentâ€™s preferences.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 3 since they value it the highest (94).
2. Assign item 5 to agent 4 since they value it the highest (93).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 0 since they value it the highest (83).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 4 since they value it the highest (87).
5. Assign item 6 to agent 1 since they value it the highest (50).
6. Assign item 4 to agent 0 since they value it highly (70).
7. Assign item 3 to agent 2 since they have a relatively balanced valuation for other items.
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 since they value it highly (70).

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly based on the given valuations. While it may not be completely envy-free due to the constraints, it gives each agent valuable items according to their preferences.
