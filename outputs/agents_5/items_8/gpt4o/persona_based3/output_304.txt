Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20   6  22  93  12  94  33  65
1  26  39  78  33  59  17  20  62
2  49  26  85  90  40  37  98   6
3  53  71  35  54  83   6  72  80
4  84  38  30  15  31  51  14  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation or as close to it as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. Given the complexity of achieving complete envy-freeness, we'll strive for a fair allocation by maximizing each agent's total value from their allocated items.

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (94), Item 3 (93)
   - Allocation: [5, 3]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (78), Item 7 (62)
   - Allocation: [2, 7]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 6 (98), Item 0 (49)
   - Allocation: [6, 0]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (83), Item 1 (71)
   - Allocation: [4, 1]

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Items: None remaining
   - Allocation: []

Let's verify:
- Total allocated items: 8 (items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
- Each item is allocated exactly once.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6, 0],
    "3": [4, 1],
    "4": []
}
```
