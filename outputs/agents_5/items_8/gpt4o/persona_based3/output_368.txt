Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  25   8  30  14  19  18  56
1  76  31  49  27  81  48  11  23
2  22  66  47  38  90  77  55  15
3  88  20  12  87  97  58  76  99
4  23  89  34  42  61   0  44  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To tackle this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the 8 items among 5 agents in a way that considers their valuations and seeks to minimize envy. One approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which ensures that each agent feels they have received a fair share compared to others, up to the removal of one item from another agent's allocation.

Considering the valuations provided, let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are generally low and scattered, with the highest being item 7 (56). We can aim to allocate item 7 to Agent 0 to maximize their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: Has a strong preference for items 0 (76) and 4 (81). Allocating item 4 to Agent 1 will maximize their valuation.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation item for Agent 2 is item 4 (90), which is already taken. Their next highest is item 5 (77). We allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has strong preferences for items 3 (87), 4 (97), and 7 (99). Since item 4 is taken, we allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 1 (89). We allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, assess the remaining items:

- Items 0, 2, 3, and 6 are left unallocated. We need to distribute these among the agents, ensuring all agents receive items and fairness is maintained.

Let's complete the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 7. We can add item 6 to Agent 0, improving overall valuation.
  
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 4. Adding item 0 will significantly increase their total value.

- **Agent 2**: Already has item 5. Adding item 3 increases their valuation without causing significant envy.

- **Agent 3**: Already has item 7. No further allocation needed.

- **Agent 4**: Already has item 1. Adding item 2 increases their valuation.

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share, with the aim of minimizing envy and maximizing the sum of valuations.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and attempts to balance the valuation across agents as fairly as possible.
