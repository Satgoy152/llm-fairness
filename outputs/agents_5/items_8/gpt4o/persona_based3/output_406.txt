Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  18  67  30  39  30   0  57
1  71  16  68  86  62  26  62  47
2  99  24  77  33  19  45  21  43
3  18  13  82  39   8  59   3  99
4  87   2  94  76  34  77  96  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and attempt to allocate items such that each agent receives a bundle that they value highly. We aim to approximate envy-freeness where possible.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 2 highly (67).
   - Consider allocating item 0 (63) as well, which is highly valued by Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values item 3 highly (86).
   - Has high value for item 0 (71) but it is already allocated to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is for item 0 (99), but it is allocated to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 5, which has a decent valuation (45).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value is for item 7 (99).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value is for item 6 (96).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, let's review our allocations and distribute the remaining items:

- Item 1 is still available, and Agent 1 values it the least, so it can be left out for now.
- Item 4 is still available:
  - Agent 1 values item 4 decently (62), allocate it to Agent 1 for balance.

- We still have item 1 left:
  - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 for a fairer distribution, as they have only one item.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring that all items are allocated. Note that complete envy-freeness might not be achievable, but this allocation tries to respect the valuations as much as possible.
