Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  22  79  45  72  38  23  11
1  60  35  96   5  75  18  57  90
2  70  48  98  67  41  86  49  63
3  93  82   9  83  79   7  25  18
4  88  47   7   2   7  80  46   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Let's attempt to distribute the items in a way that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. The goal is to minimize envy as much as possible, given that perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable with integer allocations.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** High valuation for item 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** High valuation for item 7. Allocate item 7 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** High valuation for item 5. Allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** High valuation for item 0. Allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** High valuation for item 4. Allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items 1, 3, and 6:

- **Agent 0** also has a decent valuation for item 3, so allocate item 3 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1** has a decent valuation for item 6, so allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2** has a decent valuation for item 1, so allocate item 1 to agent 2.

This allocation tries to respect the high valuations of each agent while distributing the remaining items to minimize envy.

Here are the resulting allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to minimize envy based on the provided valuations.
