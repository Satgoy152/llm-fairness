Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  93  55  73  69  57  91  41
1  96  54  12   6  73  19  99  44
2   8  42  11  23  17  71  25  56
3  28  87  50  43  13  42   6  98
4  41  90  71   7  53  48  91  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider an allocation mechanism that aims to maximize fairness and minimize envy. One commonly used method in fair division is the "Round Robin" method or the "Maximum Nash Welfare" (MNW) allocation, which seeks to balance the product of utilities.

Let's calculate a fair allocation by giving each agent the item that maximizes their utility, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. We'll try to distribute the items in such a way that the allocations are as envy-free as possible, given the constraints.

Here's one approach to allocating the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, provided no agent exceeds the average number of items (in this case, 8 items for 5 agents means some agents will get 1 item, and some will get 2).
2. If there are conflicts (i.e., two agents value an item equally), break ties by considering other valuations or using a simple randomized method to decide.

Based on the valuation matrix, let's propose an allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 6.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 7.
- Agent 4 gets item 2.

Let's check this distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 1 (93) and 5 (57) are high value for Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Items 0 (96) and 6 (99) are high value for Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Items 3 (23) and 4 (17) are relatively higher for Agent 2.
- Agent 3: Item 7 (98) is high value for Agent 3.
- Agent 4: Item 2 (71) is high value for Agent 4.

This allocation considers the agents' preferences and ensures each agent receives items valued highly by them, while distributing the items fairly.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2]
}
```
