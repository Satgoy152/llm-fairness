Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  39  95  83  65  35  58  24
1  44   2   6  49  44  24  21  34
2  88  18  96   7  85  63  13  15
3  99  21  17  86  75  29  97  28
4  54  22  63  33  92  12  53  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with respect to their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent values their bundle of items at least as much as any other bundle given to another agent. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns the highest valued item that hasn't been allocated yet to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Assign items based on highest valuation**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item.

3. **Ensure an even distribution**: Adjust if necessary to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with no agent receiving more than necessary.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most with a value of 99.
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 39.
- **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 96.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 83.
- **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 92.
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 63.
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most with a value of 97.
- **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 34.

Now, let's format this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. Each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is based on the maximum valuation strategy.
