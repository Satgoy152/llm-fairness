Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  11  67  12  90  95  40  86
1  11  96  11   0  75  42  29  99
2  96  12  93  27  74  60  24  59
3   3  89  85  16  25  65  66  64
4   8  45  57  99  18  21  22   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly while considering their valuations, one approach is to aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuations.

Given that there are 8 items and 5 agents, each agent will not receive the same number of items. However, we can strive to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
    - Item 4: Value = 90
    - Item 5: Value = 95

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Item 1: Value = 96
    - Item 7: Value = 99

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Item 0: Value = 96
    - Item 2: Value = 93

4. **Agent 3**:
    - Item 6: Value = 66

5. **Agent 4**:
    - Item 3: Value = 99

This allocation takes into account each agent's highest valuations while ensuring that all 8 items are distributed. While not strictly envy-free in the absolute sense (since item preferences vary), this distribution aims for a balance based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
