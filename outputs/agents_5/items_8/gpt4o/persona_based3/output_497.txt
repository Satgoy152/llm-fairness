Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  57  86   5  13   4  55  96
1  76  26  82  66  99  58  51  13
2  28  22  56  43  83  59  24  54
3  44  31  18  20  57  11   4  74
4  86  10  10  45  16  20  63  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we need to ensure that all items are distributed among the agents in a manner that minimizes envy. The goal is to allocate the items such that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own. While achieving perfect envy-freeness with indivisible goods is not always possible, we can aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items and aim to allocate items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

The total valuations for each agent are as follows:

- Agent 0: 342
- Agent 1: 471
- Agent 2: 369
- Agent 3: 259
- Agent 4: 282

Now, let's allocate the items to try to balance these valuations.

1. Assign the item with the highest valuation for each agent if possible.

2. Distribute remaining items to approach a balanced total valuation.

Following this approach, an example allocation might look like this:

- Agent 0 highly values item 7 (value 96), item 2 (value 86), and item 1 (value 57).
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (value 99), item 0 (value 76), and item 2 (value 82).
- Agent 2 highly values item 4 (value 83) and item 5 (value 59).
- Agent 3 highly values item 7 (value 74).
- Agent 4 highly values item 0 (value 86).

Given these observations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [2, 7] (Items 2 and 7 are highly valued by Agent 0)
- Agent 1: [4, 0] (Items 4 and 0 are highly valued by Agent 1)
- Agent 2: [5] (Item 5 is highly valued by Agent 2)
- Agent 3: [3, 6] (Items 3 and 6 are the best remaining choices for Agent 3)
- Agent 4: [1] (Item 1 is the best remaining choice for Agent 4)

This allocation attempts to balance the valuations and minimize envy, given the constraints of indivisible items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a set of items, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
