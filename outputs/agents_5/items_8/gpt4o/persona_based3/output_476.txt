Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  51  12  84  87  91  15  76
1  25  24  60  28  41  37  40  65
2  13  39  45  76  78  27   7  89
3  96  47  98  13  32  84  38  58
4  72  68  20   7  10   1  71  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and minimize envy among agents, we aim to allocate items in such a way that each agent's perceived value is maximized. This involves considering each agent's valuations and distributing items to balance these valuations as evenly as possible.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Identify Agent Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values items 5, 4, and 3 highly.
   - Agent 1 values items 2 and 7 highly.
   - Agent 2 values items 7, 4, and 3 highly.
   - Agent 3 values items 2, 0, and 5 highly.
   - Agent 4 values items 0, 1, and 6 highly.

2. **Allocate the Highest Valued Items:**
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - After initial allocations, look for items that can balance the perceived values:
     - Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (second highest value for Agent 4).
     - Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (next highest value for Agent 2).
     - Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (next highest value for Agent 4).
     - Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
     - Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).

4. **Verify Allocation Completeness:**
   - Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent has a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation strives to balance the total value perceived by each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible. Different approaches could lead to slightly different allocations, but this setup attempts to minimize envy and distribute items fairly based on the given valuations.
