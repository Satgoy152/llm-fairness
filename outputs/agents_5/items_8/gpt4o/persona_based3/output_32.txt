Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  87  51  78  37  68  46   4
1  30  57  12  12  87  13  36  53
2  11  54  72  39  22  18  44  35
3  39  55  24  57  96  99  91  88
4  92   5  81  12  54  12  96  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while trying to achieve envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

One approach to achieve a fair division is to use the "maximum marginal utility" principle, where each item is given to the agent who values it the most, iteratively, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given there are 5 agents and 8 items, every agent will receive at least one item, and three agents will receive two items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most (92).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (87).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it the most (81).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (78).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most (96).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most (99).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the most (96).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most (88).

Now, distribute them ensuring at least one item per agent:

- **Agent 0**: Gets items [1, 3]
- **Agent 1**: Gets no item initially, but must get at least one. Reassign item [2] to Agent 1
- **Agent 2**: Assign item [7] to Agent 2
- **Agent 3**: Gets items [4, 5]
- **Agent 4**: Gets items [0, 6]

Reallocation to ensure each agent gets an item:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 3]
- **Agent 1**: [2]
- **Agent 2**: [7]
- **Agent 3**: [4, 5]
- **Agent 4**: [0, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and three agents receive two items. It tries to minimize envy by allocating items based on the highest valuation where possible, ensuring a somewhat envy-free distribution.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```
