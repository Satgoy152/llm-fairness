Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  26  62  33  14  68  92  74
1  10   4  39  65  26  68  16  24
2  54  19  67  80  11  62  86  86
3  61  43   2  36  10   3  12  58
4  64  45  35  20  38  68  61   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each allocation is envy-free and as fair as possible given the valuations. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0 Valuations:**
   - Highest valued items: 6 (92), 5 (68), 7 (74)

2. **Agent 1 Valuations:**
   - Highest valued items: 3 (65), 5 (68), 2 (39)

3. **Agent 2 Valuations:**
   - Highest valued items: 3 (80), 6 (86), 7 (86)

4. **Agent 3 Valuations:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (61), 1 (43), 7 (58)

5. **Agent 4 Valuations:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (64), 5 (68), 1 (45)

By selecting the items based on each agent's highest valuations and avoiding conflicts, we can try to reach an envy-free allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items 6 and 7, which they value highly and are less valued by other agents.
- **Agent 1:** Item 3, which they value highest and is also valued by Agent 2, but Agent 2 can be compensated by other items.
- **Agent 2:** Items 5 and 2, which are valued highly and 5 is also valued by Agent 4, but Agent 4 can be compensated by other items.
- **Agent 3:** Items 0 and 1, which are among their highest valued and less conflictive with others.
- **Agent 4:** Item 4, which is of moderate value but ensures a fair distribution.

This allocation tries to balance the high-value items across agents, considering their preferences and minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, balancing their preferences as much as possible.
