Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80   4  40  22  91  13  10  42
1  89  74  95  87   6  76  49  63
2   5  25  92  93  87   7   9  86
3  68  31   1  59  24  26  82  13
4  48  40  58  17  71  84  64  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuation of the items. Our goal is to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences.

Let's start by examining the valuations more closely and then propose an allocation:

### Valuations Table:
- **Agent 0**: [80, 4, 40, 22, 91, 13, 10, 42]
- **Agent 1**: [89, 74, 95, 87, 6, 76, 49, 63]
- **Agent 2**: [5, 25, 92, 93, 87, 7, 9, 86]
- **Agent 3**: [68, 31, 1, 59, 24, 26, 82, 13]
- **Agent 4**: [48, 40, 58, 17, 71, 84, 64, 71]

### Strategy:
1. **Highest Valuation Allocation**: Start by assigning items to agents who value them the highest, as this tends to minimize envy.
2. **Balancing**: Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, and balance the total value of items received across agents to maintain fairness.

### Proposed Allocation:
1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 (Valuation: 89)
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 (Valuation: 74)
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 (Valuation: 95)
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 (Valuation: 93)
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 (Valuation: 91)
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 (Valuation: 84)
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 (Valuation: 82)
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 (Valuation: 86)

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they highly value, potentially minimizing envy.

### JSON Format Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed, and each agent receives items they highly value, aiming for a fair and envy-free division.
