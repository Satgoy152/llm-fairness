Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88   5  89  67  48  74  58  74
1  44  38  48  65  63  65  48  84
2  40  45  93  78  58  94  81  96
3  48  78  69   4   2  36  40  26
4  49  52  55  71  96  14  31  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we should aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness ensures that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. This is challenging to achieve perfectly with discrete items and varying valuations, but we can strive for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible.

Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum the values each agent assigns to all items to gauge their relative value scale.
2. **Item Allocation Priority**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation for each item.
3. **Adjust for Balance**: Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible and try to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's perform these steps:

1. **Total Valuation for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: 503
   - Agent 1: 455
   - Agent 2: 585
   - Agent 3: 303
   - Agent 4: 455

2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it highest at 88.
   - Item 1: Agent 3 values it highest at 78.
   - Item 2: Agent 2 values it highest at 93.
   - Item 3: Agent 2 values it highest at 78.
   - Item 4: Agent 4 values it highest at 96.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it highest at 94.
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it highest at 81.
   - Item 7: Agent 2 values it highest at 96.

3. **Adjust for Balance and Fairness**:
   - Agent 0 receives Item 0.
   - Agent 1 receives Item 3.
   - Agent 2 has too many items, so redistribute: give Item 3 to Agent 1 and Item 7 to Agent 4.
   - Agent 3 receives Item 1.
   - Agent 4 receives Item 4 and Item 7.

Here is a fairer allocation considering the adjustments for better balance:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items and the total value received by each agent, minimizing envy within the constraints.
