Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  34  47  29  44  80  35  97
1  90  95  16   1  80  48  74   7
2  33  87  18  39  46  52  46  78
3  39  12  46  95  22  15  71  71
4  47  90  93  10  95  22  58  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a fair division, possibly focusing on minimizing envy, although achieving perfect envy-freeness may not always be possible due to the discrete nature of the problem.

We have 5 agents and 8 items, and each agent has different valuations for the items. A common approach in such scenarios is to apply the "round-robin" method or other fair division techniques to ensure each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.

Here's one way to proceed with the allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent.
2. Sort the items by their highest value across all agents.
3. Allocate items to agents based on maximizing their individual utility while considering the overall fairness.

Let's calculate the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 97 + 34 + 47 + 29 + 44 + 80 + 35 + 97 = 463
- Agent 1: 90 + 95 + 16 +  1 + 80 + 48 + 74 +  7 = 411
- Agent 2: 33 + 87 + 18 + 39 + 46 + 52 + 46 + 78 = 399
- Agent 3: 39 + 12 + 46 + 95 + 22 + 15 + 71 + 71 = 371
- Agent 4: 47 + 90 + 93 + 10 + 95 + 22 + 58 + 54 = 469

Next, we allocate the items, aiming to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. Agent 4 gets item 4 (95), item 2 (93).
2. Agent 1 gets item 1 (95), item 0 (90).
3. Agent 0 gets item 7 (97).
4. Agent 3 gets item 3 (95).
5. Agent 2 gets item 6 (46), item 5 (52).

This allocation respects the principle of maximizing each agent's utility based on their highest available valuation and attempts to minimize envy.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, while attempting to maximize fairness and minimize envy based on the given valuations.
