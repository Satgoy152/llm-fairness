Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   2  47  92  81  74   0  52   5
1  19  48  87   3  41   2  93  92
2  75  80  16  11  89  72  31  88
3  46  77   9  29  63  94  98  67
4  42  14  83  48  90  55  57  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close as possible given the constraints. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Agent 0 highly values item 2.
   - Agent 1 highly values item 6.
   - Agent 2 highly values item 4.
   - Agent 3 highly values items 5 and 6.
   - Agent 4 highly values item 4.

2. **Strategy**:
   - First, allocate the most valued items to each agent if possible.
   - Then, allocate the remaining items in a way that minimizes envy.

3. **Allocations**:
   - **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (highest value for agent 0).
   - **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6 (highest value for agent 1).
   - **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4 (highest value for agent 2).
   - **Agent 3**: Allocate items 5 and 7 (high values and to balance the allocation).
   - **Agent 4**: Allocate items 0, 1, and 3 (remaining items).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent high-valued items while ensuring that all items are distributed fairly among the agents, given the constraints.
