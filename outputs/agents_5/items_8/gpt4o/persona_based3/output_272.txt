Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  14  36   9  95  27  19  43
1  85  32  63  53  80  80  39   9
2  68  16  42  90  12  47   4  94
3  56  66  70  91  42  38  48  62
4  14  40  10  33  85  26  65  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To approach the fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider methods that aim to achieve fairness, such as maximizing the total utility or seeking envy-freeness. However, given the discrete and limited number of items and agents, achieving perfect envy-freeness might be difficult, but we can aim for a relatively fair distribution based on given valuations.

Let's use a greedy algorithm that considers the highest valuation first to ensure each agent gets items they value highly, which can often lead to a fair allocation in practice.

Here are the valuations for each agent per item:

- Agent 0: [22, 14, 36, 9, 95, 27, 19, 43]
- Agent 1: [85, 32, 63, 53, 80, 80, 39, 9]
- Agent 2: [68, 16, 42, 90, 12, 47, 4, 94]
- Agent 3: [56, 66, 70, 91, 42, 38, 48, 62]
- Agent 4: [14, 40, 10, 33, 85, 26, 65, 29]

### Allocation Process:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 85 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 66 by Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 70 by Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 91 by Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 95 by Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 80 by Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 65 by Agent 4.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 94 by Agent 2.

### Allocated Items:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 4: Item 6

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 2, 3],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they value highly, aiming for a fair distribution based on the provided valuations.
