Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  89  14   4  99  16   6  88
1  43  94  12  16  91   7  79  88
2  46  39  42  78  77  44  60  73
3  56  57  94  28  56  89  12  95
4   4   0  99  82  38   1  57  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation, we need to ensure that the distribution of items among agents is as equitable as possible, considering their individual valuations. A common approach is to aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Identify any clear high-value preferences:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (99).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 1 (94).
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most (78).
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the most (94).
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the most (99). However, since Agent 3 has the highest value for item 2 (94), we need to consider this in the allocation to avoid envy.

2. **Assign each agent their highest valued item:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 4.
   - Agent 1 gets item 1.
   - Agent 2 gets item 3.
   - Agent 3 gets item 2.
   - Agent 4 will need another allocation since item 2 is taken.

3. **Allocate remaining items considering second preferences and ensuring no envy:**
   - Agent 0's second highest preference is item 7 (88), assign item 7 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1's second highest preference is item 0 (43), assign item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2's second highest preference is item 7 (73), but it's taken by Agent 0, so assign item 6 (60) to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3's second highest preference is item 7 (95), but it's taken by Agent 0, so assign item 5 (89) to Agent 3.
   - Agent 4 receives item 5 (1) as it is the only preference remaining.

4. **Final allocation check:** Ensure all items are distributed and each agent has items assigned to them.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 7.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 0.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 6.
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 5.
- Agent 4 receives no items, as all items have been allocated, and their highest preference was already taken. 

Note: This allocation attempts to minimize envy by aligning high-value items with agents' preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.
