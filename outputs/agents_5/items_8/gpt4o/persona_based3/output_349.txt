Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  20  81  22  39  53  85  39
1  11  47  40  14  82   1  96  13
2  86  30  32  60  93   9   7  27
3  19  63  62  11  91   2  18  28
4  62  57  81   0  64  61  31   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means each agent feels they have received the best or an equally desirable bundle of items compared to others, based on their valuations. Given the constraints and the need for integer allocations, we will strive for a balanced distribution of value among agents.

Let's first summarize the problem:

- We have 5 agents and 8 items.
- Each agent must receive at least one item, and every item must be allocated.

Given the valuations, let's proceed with a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 6 (85) and item 2 (81).
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 6 (96) and item 4 (82).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 4 (93) and item 0 (86).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 4 (91) and item 1 (63).
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 2 (81) and item 5 (61).

Using these high valuations, we can explore a potential allocation:

- Assign item 6 to agent 1 (as they have the highest valuation for it).
- Assign item 4 to agent 2 (as they have the highest valuation for it).
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (as they have the second highest valuation for it and agent 4 values it equally).
- Assign item 0 to agent 4 (as they value it highly and agent 2 already has item 4).
- Assign item 1 to agent 3 (as it's their highest remaining valued item).
- Assign item 5 to agent 4 (as it's their second highest valued item).
- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (as a balancing item since they only received item 2 so far).
- Assign item 7 to agent 3 (as a balancing item since they only received item 1 so far).

This allocation aims to balance the value each agent receives, based on their preferences. 

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that:
- Each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
- All 8 items are allocated.
- Each agent gets at least one item.
