Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  15  79  99  90  19  70  81
1   4  53  14   0  82   1  91  25
2  54  29  77  63  24  66   0  34
3  48  69   0  92  71  96  35  52
4  27  91  15  46  50  34   1  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free, we need to allocate items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. Given the constraints and valuations, a direct envy-free allocation might not be possible, but we can aim for a fair division where each agent receives a roughly balanced allocation in terms of their perceived value.

One approach to achieve this is to use a round-robin method or a modified version of the "maximin" strategy, where each agent picks their most valued item from the remaining unallocated items in a sequential order. Another approach is to use an algorithmic method like the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division algorithms that attempt to balance the allocations based on these valuations.

Here's one possible allocation based on a heuristic approach:
- Assign items based on individual highest valuations while trying to ensure that each agent receives at least one item.

Allocation:
- Agent 0 highly values item 3 the most, so item 3 is allocated to them first.
- Agent 1 highly values item 6, so item 6 is allocated to them.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2, so item 2 is allocated to them.
- Agent 3 highly values item 5, so item 5 is allocated to them.
- Agent 4 highly values item 1, so item 1 is allocated to them.

Now, distribute remaining items:
- Agent 0 has item 3, next highest unallocated is item 7, allocate item 7 to agent 0.
- Remaining items are 0, 4.
- Agent 1 has item 6, next highest unallocated is item 4, allocate item 4 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has item 2, next highest unallocated is item 0, allocate item 0 to agent 2.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, while attempting to respect their valuation preferences as much as possible within the constraints provided.
