Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  33  27  43  43  43  28  90
1  24  86  17  11   7  77  28  44
2  57  35  36  44  66  50  60  85
3  26  16  91  37  57   6  34  73
4  64  55  39   8  61   1  14  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation if possible. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Let's go through the valuations and attempt to distribute the items accordingly.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Start by identifying items with the highest value for each agent.

2. **Assign Items Based on Preferences**: Allocate items where there is a clear preference from one agent significantly higher than others.

3. **Balance Remaining Items**: Distribute remaining items to balance the total valuation across agents as evenly as possible.

Here's an allocation that attempts to minimize envy and is fair:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 7.
- **Agent 1** most values item 1.
- **Agent 2** most values item 7 but since it's taken, consider other high-valued items like 0.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 2.
- **Agent 4** most values item 0 but since it's taken, consider other high-valued items like 4.

Now, let's allocate:

- Agent 0: Items [7] (value: 90)
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5] (value: 86 + 77 = 163)
- Agent 2: Items [0, 6] (value: 57 + 60 = 117)
- Agent 3: Items [2, 3] (value: 91 + 37 = 128)
- Agent 4: Items [4] (value: 61)

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to consider each agent's preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and only 8 items are allocated in total.
