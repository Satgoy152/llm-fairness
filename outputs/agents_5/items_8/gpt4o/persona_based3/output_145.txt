Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  76  29  65  21  80  35  54
1  72  43  52  82  89  33  81   8
2  94  32  76  67  92  77  59  30
3  99  18  79  78  42   7  32  90
4  64  49  77  11   3  77  13  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of "envy-freeness." An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. We can aim to achieve an allocation where each agent is as satisfied as possible given their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation strategy that seeks to minimize envy and fairly allocate all items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Try to allocate items in a way that each agent gets a fair share of their total preferred value, while also ensuring that no agent strongly envies another's allocation based on their valuation.

In this particular case, we will allocate items by evaluating which agent values each item the most and assign it to them while maintaining a balance.

Let's proceed with such a strategy:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most at 99.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 76.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 79.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 82.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 89.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 80.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 81.
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most at 90.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item by adjusting allocations to prevent any agent from getting more than necessary while others get none. Agent 2 and Agent 4 currently have no items, so we'll adjust accordingly:

- Move Item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 also values it highly.
- Move Item 6 from Agent 1 to Agent 4, as Agent 4 values it sufficiently, and Agent 1 already has multiple items.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 2, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the allocation of items according to the highest valuations, while ensuring each agent receives some portion of the items.
