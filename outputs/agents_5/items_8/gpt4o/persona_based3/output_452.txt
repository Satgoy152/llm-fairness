Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  56  11  80   8  78  88  46
1  17  77  32  33  89  27  96  70
2  86  25  81  99  61  92  69  55
3  13  76  86  89  84  12  98  58
4  29   3  32   0  12  51  23  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we aim to allocate the 8 items to the 5 agents in a way that is as fair as possible according to their valuations, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and no more than two items (since there are more agents than items). We aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents.

Let's start by analyzing the table to identify potential allocations. We notice that maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring fairness can be challenging due to the constraints. Here's a step-by-step approach for allocation:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the most at 88.
   - Agent 1 values item 6 the most at 96.
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the most at 99.
   - Agent 3 values item 6 the most at 98.
   - Agent 4 values item 7 the most at 76.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign item 6 to Agent 3 because it is highly valued and provides a good starting point for fairness given other values.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2, also highly valued.

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - For Agent 0, assign item 0 (value of 82) as it is the next highest value for them.
   - For Agent 1, assign item 4 (value of 89) as it is a high-value item for them.
   - For Agent 4, assign item 7 (value of 76).
   - Allocate remaining items 1, 2, and 5:
     - Agent 0: Item 5 (value of 78).
     - Agent 1: Item 1 (value of 77).
     - Agent 2: Item 2 (value of 81).

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's valuation of the items they receive while ensuring no agent is overly envious of another's allocation.

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent receives items such that their valuations are respected as much as possible within the constraints.
