Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  11  18  69  69  81  67  64
1  64  46  73  15   0  93  58  98
2  43  78  68  51  61  10  22  48
3  55  68  19  95  53  50  96  96
4  68  48  89  90  97  56  55   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. One approach to achieve this is to use a maximin strategy, where we try to maximize the minimum value received by each agent. This means each agent should receive the most valuable items they prefer, while ensuring that no agent feels envious of anotherâ€™s allocation.

Let's analyze the given valuations and make allocations:

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Items 5 (81), 4 (69), 3 (69)
   - Allocate Item 5 (most valuable to Agent 0)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (98), 5 (93)
   - Allocate Item 7 (most valuable to Agent 1)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (78), 2 (68), 4 (61)
   - Allocate Item 1 (most valuable to Agent 2)
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Items 6 (96), 7 (96), 3 (95)
   - Allocate Item 3 (most valuable yet unallocated to Agent 3)
   
5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Items 4 (97), 3 (90), 2 (89)
   - Allocate Item 4 (most valuable yet unallocated to Agent 4)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items while trying to maintain balance:

- **Remaining Items**: 0, 2, 6
- **Agent 0's next highest valuation**: Item 0 (30)
- **Agent 1's next highest valuation**: Item 2 (73)
- **Agent 3's next highest valuation**: Item 6 (96)

### Final Allocation:

Based on the above analysis, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items close to their highest preferences, and the total number of items allocated equals 8.
