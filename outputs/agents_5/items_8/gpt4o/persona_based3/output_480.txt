Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  54  70  97  68  43  58  85
1  77  56  94  71  99  74  17  41
2  16  12  73  78  26  99  27  30
3  24  27  42  92  73  91  22  11
4   5  14  55  10  47  64  59  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that the distribution is as envy-free as possible, meaning no agent prefers the allocation of any other agent over their own. Given the constraints, each agent will receive at least one item, and the total number of items allocated will be exactly eight.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Letâ€™s allocate item 3. Agent 0 values this item at 97, which is the highest among their valuations.

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4. Agent 1 values this item at 99, which is the highest among their valuations.

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5. Agent 2 values this item at 99, which is the highest among their valuations.

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 2. Agent 3 values this item at 42, which is the highest among their valuations.

5. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 7. Agent 4 values this item at 84, which is the highest among their valuations.

Now, we have three more items to allocate (items 0, 1, and 6). We will distribute these remaining items to balance the allocation:

6. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 0. Agent 0 values this item at 61.

7. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6. Agent 1 values this item at 17.

8. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1. Agent 3 values this item at 27.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is eight. Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 1],
    "4": [7]
}
```
