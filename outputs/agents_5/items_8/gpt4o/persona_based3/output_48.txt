Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  94  48  96  95  50   1  68
1  56  95   3  61  13  81  85  17
2   6  39  70  28  60   0  55  41
3  14  35  14  53   0  73   0  61
4  52  73  40  57  35  65  79  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation where each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method that aims to minimize envy among agents. One way to do this is by maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's start by considering each agent's highest-valued items and then allocate according to these preferences while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (96), 4 (95), 1 (94)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (95), 5 (81), 0 (56)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 2 (70), 4 (60), 6 (55)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (73), 7 (61), 3 (53)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (79), 7 (72), 1 (73)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (0, 4, 7) to further balance the allocations:

6. **Remaining allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Allocate item 0 (29)
   - Agent 4: Allocate item 4 (35)
   - Agent 3: Allocate item 7 (61)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and attempts to minimize envy by giving each agent one of their top-valued items.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [6, 4]
}
```
