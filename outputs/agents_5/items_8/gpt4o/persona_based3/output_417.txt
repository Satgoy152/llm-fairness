Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  49   1  66  28  86  84  92
1  67  14   6  11  20  95  99  17
2  90  83  34   4  66  82   6  80
3  65  85  93  35  80   8  28  36
4   0  90  18  71  72  70  37  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents in a manner that aims for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate all 8 items to the 5 agents such that the allocation is as fair as possible.

Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Look for items that have significantly high valuations across different agents and try to assign them in a way that reduces envy.
2. **Balance Total Value:** Ensure each agent gets a fair total value, if possible.
3. **Assign Remaining Items:** Distribute the remaining items to balance the allocations.

A possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4 
  - Total Value = 1 + 28 = 29
- Agent 1: Items 5, 7
  - Total Value = 95 + 17 = 112
- Agent 2: Item 0
  - Total Value = 90
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6
  - Total Value = 35 + 28 = 63
- Agent 4: Item 1
  - Total Value = 90

This allocation is one of the possibilities and tries to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, aiming for a fair division based on the given valuations.
