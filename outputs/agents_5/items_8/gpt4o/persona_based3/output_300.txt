Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  17  82  96  77  94  89  58
1  33  52  70  71  95  63  11   7
2  48  43  21  24  44  81  25  42
3  40  43  94  39  76  73  79  29
4  32  66  39  35  90  53  42  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while attempting to maintain envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to use the maximum envy-free allocation algorithm, which seeks to minimize the maximum envy among all agents. However, achieving complete envy-freeness is often not possible, especially with indivisible items, so the goal is to minimize envy as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and aim to allocate items such that each agent receives items with high personal value, potentially reducing the envy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3 and 5.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 4 and 2.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 5.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 2 and 6.
5. **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 4 and 7.

Let's try distributing the items in a manner that attempts to maximize individual satisfaction based on the given valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Receives items [0, 3] (high values: 86, 96)
- **Agent 1**: Receives items [4, 1] (high values: 95, 52)
- **Agent 2**: Receives item [5] (high value: 81)
- **Agent 3**: Receives items [2, 6] (high values: 94, 79)
- **Agent 4**: Receives item [7] (high value: 84)

Now, the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value highly, thus aiming to minimize envy. Note that some agents receive more items, but the focus is on maximizing the total value for each agent.
