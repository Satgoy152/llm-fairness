Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  68  23   4  88  13   2  13
1   9  64  76  90  84  64   3  63
2  48   9   0  70  88  33  16  78
3  63  69  80  68  27  79  25  92
4   0  46  89  43  46  60  80   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy among agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Envy-freeness implies that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

Considering the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 4 highly (88) but has generally low valuations for other items.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 3 (90) and 2 (76).
3. **Agent 2** values items 4 (88) and 7 (78) significantly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 7 (92) the most and generally has higher valuations.
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 (89) and item 6 (80) the highest.

Given these valuations, we can assign items based on highest preferences while aiming to distribute the items such that each agent receives a relatively high-value item according to their valuations. Let's perform this allocation:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because it's the highest valued item for Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 because it's the highest valued item for Agent 1.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 because it's one of the highest valued items for Agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 because it's the highest valued item for Agent 4.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3, as it is relatively high for Agent 3 compared to others, and it may prevent envy from Agent 0 for item 4.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 because it has a relatively high value for Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, which is the next highest item for Agent 1.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4, which also has a high relative value for Agent 4.

Now, each agent should have an allocation such that no agent envies another agent's allocation significantly, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to take into account the highest preferences of each agent to ensure a fair distribution that minimizes envy.
