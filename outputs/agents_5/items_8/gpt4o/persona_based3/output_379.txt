Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  59  67  45  17  13  76   7
1  45  47  94  88  15  80  18  70
2  71  73  12  17  56  86  25  39
3  44  86  98   1  90  32  20  47
4  58  52   7  71   6  76   5  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can use an approach that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Below is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 6 the highest (76).
   - Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (94).
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (86).
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (98).
   - Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (71).

2. **Initial allocation based on highest values**:
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (since Agent 3 also wants item 2, we will resolve this with subsequent steps).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

3. **Resolve conflicts and allocate remaining items**:
   - Since item 2 has already been allocated to Agent 1, we look for the next best allocation for Agent 3. Agent 3's next highest preference is item 1 (86), so allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
   - Now, allocate remaining items to ensure each agent gets at least some value, prioritizing those who have not received items yet.

4. **Final allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Item 6
   - Agent 1: Item 2
   - Agent 2: Item 5
   - Agent 3: Item 1
   - Agent 4: Item 3

5. **Distribute remaining items**:
   - Items left: 0, 4, 7
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0 is 48).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 (next highest value for Agent 3 is 90).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1 is 70).

After the allocations, each agent ends up with a set of items that maximizes their satisfaction given the constraints, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
