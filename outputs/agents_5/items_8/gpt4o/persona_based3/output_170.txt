Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  40  38  60  48  46  92  57
1  27  69   6  90  30   5  52  64
2  96  69  18  32  82  96  29  36
3  98  61  70   5  91   2  41  86
4   4  12  67  68  57  13  65  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use an algorithm that approximates the concept of maximizing the minimum utility or using the idea of competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI). Given the valuations of items by each agent, we should aim to give each agent a set of items that maximizes their perceived value while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Below is one possible allocation that attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 6, so allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 3, so allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 and item 5, so allocate these items to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 2 and item 7, so allocate these items to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 4 and item 1, so allocate these items to Agent 4.

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly:

- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: Items 2, 7
- Agent 4: Items 4, 1

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and all items are allocated.
