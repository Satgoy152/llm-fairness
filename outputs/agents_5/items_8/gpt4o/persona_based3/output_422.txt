Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  14  31   2  57   8  65   0
1  69   3  19  31   9  45  68  72
2  18  54  85   1  36  43  43   6
3  70  62  68  86  99  22  85  66
4  34  26  61  23  66  43  59  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuation. A potential approach involves using a method called "round-robin" where agents take turns picking their most valued item that has not yet been allocated. We will proceed with this method:

1. **Round 1**:
   - Agent 0 picks item 6 (value 65)
   - Agent 1 picks item 7 (value 72)
   - Agent 2 picks item 2 (value 85)
   - Agent 3 picks item 4 (value 99)
   - Agent 4 picks item 7 (value 82), but item 7 is already taken. Agent 4 picks item 4 (value 66), but item 4 is already taken. Agent 4 picks item 2 (value 61), but item 2 is already taken. Agent 4 picks item 5 (value 43).

2. **Round 2**:
   - Agent 0 picks item 4 (value 57), but item 4 is already taken. Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 54).
   - Agent 1 picks item 6 (value 68), but item 6 is already taken. Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 69), but item 0 is already taken. Agent 1 picks item 5 (value 45), but item 5 is already taken. Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 31).
   - Agent 2 picks item 5 (value 43), but item 5 is already taken. Agent 2 picks item 6 (value 43), but item 6 is already taken. Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 54).
   - Agent 3 picks item 6 (value 85), but item 6 is already taken. Agent 3 picks item 3 (value 86), but item 3 is already taken. Agent 3 picks item 2 (value 68), but item 2 is already taken. Agent 3 picks item 7 (value 66).
   - Agent 4 picks item 1 (value 26), but item 1 is already taken. Agent 4 picks item 3 (value 23), but item 3 is already taken. Agent 4 picks item 0 (value 34), but item 0 is already taken. Agent 4 picks item 1 (value 26), but item 1 is already taken. Agent 4 picks item 7 (value 82), but item 7 is already taken. All items have been checked.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation assigns each item to exactly one agent, ensuring all items are distributed. This solution attempts to satisfy envy-freeness as much as possible given the constraints of integer assignments and all items being allocated.
