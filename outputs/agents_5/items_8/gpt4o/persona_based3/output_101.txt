Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  67   0  15  98  98  94  12
1  43  89  11  28  46  51  66  70
2  73  91  99  27  63  27  61  81
3  24  99  24   1  86  85  84  13
4  41  58  78  44   8  36  95  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agentâ€™s allocation. Given the discrete nature of the problem (items must be allocated entirely to one agent), we may not achieve perfect envy-freeness, but we can aim for a fair distribution based on the valuations provided.

Let's analyze the data and make a fair allocation:

1. Identify high-value items for each agent and try to allocate those to maximize each agent's happiness.
2. Ensure each agent receives a decent valuation relative to others, attempting to balance total allocated value across agents.

Based on the provided valuations, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** values items 4, 5, and 6 highly.
- **Agent 1** values items 1 and 7 highly.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 very highly.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 highly.
- **Agent 4** has a relatively high valuation for item 6.

Given these observations, let's attempt to allocate items as follows:

- Allocate items 4 and 5 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
- Allocate items 6 and 3 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 for balance.

The allocations can be represented as follows in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 3]
}
```

This allocation considers the high-value items for each agent and attempts to distribute the overall value fairly among them.
