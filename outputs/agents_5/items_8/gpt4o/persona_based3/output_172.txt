Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  74  29  93  46  71  31   6
1  29  50  92   3  60  18  39  40
2  93  97  92  39  65  93  53  34
3  63   4  67  40  99  77  24  12
4  26  64  90  16   1  70  92  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with respect to their valuations, I'll aim for an allocation that tries to minimize envy and gives each agent a reasonable share of the total value based on their rankings. Let's consider the possible allocation:

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Looking at Agent 0's highest valuation items: 3 (93), 1 (74), 5 (71).
   - To balance, give item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valuation items: 2 (92), 4 (60), 1 (50).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valuation items: 1 (97), 0 (93), 5 (93), 2 (92).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest valuation items: 4 (99), 5 (77), 2 (67).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Highest valuation items: 6 (92), 2 (90), 5 (70).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to balance the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 1.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 4.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 6.

Remaining items are 0, 5, and 7. Let's distribute these to balance valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (valued at 26 for them).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (valued at 77 for them).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (valued at 6 for them).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [6, 0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items based on the highest valuations and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 8 items allocated.
