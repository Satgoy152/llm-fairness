Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  80  10  28  42  95  53  56
1  72  98  11  19  20  93  58  13
2  87  27  74  46  38   5  65  77
3  31  70  54  29  74  47  27  85
4  81   4  51  22  46  99  96  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. A common approach to achieve fairness is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the constraints and nature of the problem, we will attempt to allocate the items in a way that is as balanced as possible in terms of total valuation for each agent.

Here's a possible allocation strategy for the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 5 (95), so we can start by assigning item 5 to them. They also value item 0 (92) highly, which can be assigned to them.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 1 (98) and item 5 (93), but since item 5 is already allocated, we can allocate item 1 to them. They also value item 0 (72), but it’s allocated, so we can move on to item 6 (58).

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 (87) highly, but it’s taken, so we can allocate item 7 (77) to them as it is the next highest valued item for them.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 7 (85), but it's allocated, so we can give them item 4 (74).

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has high valuations for items 5 (99), 6 (96), but since both are taken, we can give them item 2 (51).

After these allocations, we still have items 3 and 6 to allocate. We can assign item 6 to Agent 0 (since they have space and it fits their needs well) and item 3 to Agent 3 (since it fits their needs well).

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items in a manner that is as fair as possible given the constraints.
