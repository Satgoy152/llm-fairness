Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  61  47  76  46  32   5  21
1  33  71  71  47  64  67  29  99
2  61  65  38  17  18  26  51  35
3  89  27  11  13  58  79  77  99
4  52  65  95  10  93  79  41  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we will allocate the items such that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness in every scenario, we aim to minimize envy and fairly distribute the items based on the provided valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Values:** Sum up the valuations for each agent to understand their total value perceptions.
2. **Initial Allocations:** Assign items based on the highest individual valuation for each item to minimize envy.
3. **Adjustments for Fairness:** Ensure each agent receives at least one item and adjust allocations to balance perceived values.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

### Step 1: Highest Valuation Initial Assignments
- Item 0: Agent 0 (value 94)
- Item 1: Agent 1 (value 71)
- Item 2: Agent 4 (value 95)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (value 76)
- Item 4: Agent 4 (value 93)
- Item 5: Agent 3 (value 79)
- Item 6: Agent 3 (value 77)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (value 99)

### Step 2: Adjustments for Fairness
- Ensure all agents get at least one item. Distribute items by reallocating from agents with more than one item to those with none or least value.
- Reassignment to ensure everyone gets at least one item (while maintaining or slightly reducing envy):
  - Agent 2 has no items. Reassign item 6 from Agent 3 to Agent 2.
  
### Final Allocation
Considering the above adjustments, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items while attempting to maintain fairness and minimize envy based on the provided valuations.
