Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  38  80  89   6  33  32  93
1  10  76  76  45  66  66  32  31
2  80  29   7  37  24  20  58  83
3   0  44   6  85  25  78   0   1
4  95  77   8  10  34  93  29  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim for an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one in which no agent prefers the bundle of any other agent to their own, based on their valuations.

We will attempt to allocate the items such that the total value each agent receives is balanced, considering their preferences. Below is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 7.
2. Agent 1 values items 1 and 4 highly.
3. Agent 2 places high value on items 0 and 7.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 0 and item 5.

With this in mind, here's an allocation that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 1, 4
- Agent 2 receives items: 0
- Agent 3 receives items: 5
- Agent 4 receives items: 6, 7

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to reflect the agents' preferences and distribute the total value fairly. Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated without exceeding the available number of items.
