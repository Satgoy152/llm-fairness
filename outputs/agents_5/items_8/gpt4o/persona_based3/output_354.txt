Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  28  89  49  68   8  31  75
1  31  77  52  37  44   2  89  53
2   3  57  71  34  55  45  20  16
3  54  58  12  96  18  53   0  88
4  10  39  93  42  30  47   4  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One possible approach to achieve this is to use a method that balances the total value each agent receives according to their own valuation.

To implement a fair allocation, we can use the "round robin" method, which involves iterating through the agents and allowing each agent to pick the item they value the most from the remaining unallocated items. This is repeated until all items have been allocated. 

Let's proceed with the round robin allocation:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 2 (value 89)
2. **Agent 1** picks item 6 (value 89)
3. **Agent 2** picks item 2 (already picked, so next best is item 5, value 45)
4. **Agent 3** picks item 3 (value 96)
5. **Agent 4** picks item 2 (already picked, so next best is item 5, value 47)

Continue the process with the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0** picks item 7 (value 75)
7. **Agent 1** picks item 1 (value 77)
8. **Agent 2** picks item 4 (value 55)
9. **Agent 3** picks item 0 (value 54)
10. **Agent 4** picks item 4 (already picked, so next best is item 3, value 42)

Since all items are allocated, the process stops here. The allocation based on the round robin method is as follows:

- Agent 0: [2, 7]
- Agent 1: [6, 1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [3, 0]
- Agent 4: [4]

Now, ensuring the correct JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their top choices in a fair sequence, minimizing envy within the constraints of the problem.
