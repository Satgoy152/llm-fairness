Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  26  66  70  29  31  32  59
1  31  53  55  11  17  34  61  71
2   6  26   4  16  15  50  46  55
3  50  61  53  74  87  23  53  86
4  91  94  99  84  57  73  61  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuation of each item and aims to maximize the perceived value each agent receives. A common approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most-valued available item until all items are allocated.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for any item (99 for item 2), so they pick first:
   - Agent 4 takes item 2 (99).

2. **Agent 3** has the next highest valuation (87 for item 4), so they pick next:
   - Agent 3 takes item 4 (87).

3. **Agent 4** picks again, having the next highest valuation (97 for item 7):
   - Agent 4 takes item 7 (97).

4. **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation (74 for item 0), so they pick next:
   - Agent 0 takes item 0 (74).

5. **Agent 3** picks again, having the next highest valuation (86 for item 7, but it’s taken, so they take item 3):
   - Agent 3 takes item 3 (74).

6. **Agent 4** picks again, having the next highest valuation for the remaining items (94 for item 1):
   - Agent 4 takes item 1 (94).

7. **Agent 1** picks next, with the highest remaining valuation (71 for item 7, but it’s taken, so they take item 5):
   - Agent 1 takes item 5 (34).

8. **Agent 2** picks last, taking the only remaining item:
   - Agent 2 takes item 6 (46).

Now, all items are allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible.
