Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  80  23  80  41   5  47   8
1  57  17   9  83  80  40  74  37
2  91  27  37  10  35  40  74  68
3  57  95  59  56  97  89  91  27
4  43   8  43  22  46  37  74  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and that all items are allocated exactly once. 

Let's proceed with a simple allocation strategy that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while keeping the allocation balanced:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items, and then try to allocate items to agents based on their highest values, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

2. Ensure that all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values: [68, 80, 23, 80, 41, 5, 47, 8]
- Agent 1 values: [57, 17, 9, 83, 80, 40, 74, 37]
- Agent 2 values: [91, 27, 37, 10, 35, 40, 74, 68]
- Agent 3 values: [57, 95, 59, 56, 97, 89, 91, 27]
- Agent 4 values: [43, 8, 43, 22, 46, 37, 74, 69]

After considering the valuations, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]
- Agent 3: [1, 6]
- Agent 4: [7]

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that they value highly while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
