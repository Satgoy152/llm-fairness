Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  43  79  51  66  21  34  69
1  95  85  24  12  23  70   1  58
2  17  18  16  18  37  55  33  40
3  32  74  38  44  97  11  93  89
4  41  99  69  31  90  60  41  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution that maximizes the total value for each agent based on their individual preferences. Given the table of valuations, we'll try to allocate the items such that each agent receives the items they value most.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the highest (91).  
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the highest (95) but let's allocate their second preference, item 1 (85), to avoid conflicts.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the highest (55).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 the highest (97).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 the highest (99), but since item 1 is allocated to agent 1, let's allocate item 4 (90), which is the next highest available preference.

Given this approach, let's distribute the remaining items by going through the remaining highest preferences available:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 0, next highest is item 2 (79).
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 4, next highest is item 6 (93).
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 4, next highest is item 2 (69), but it is taken, so item 3 (31) is allocated.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value while ensuring all 8 items are allocated.
