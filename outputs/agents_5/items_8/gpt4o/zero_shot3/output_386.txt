Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  26  74  93  21   2  48  27
1  99  15  61  14  96  94  86  49
2  82  16  14  17  94  70  54  50
3  18  89  58  27  96  66  14  33
4  80  46  16  20  22  34  19  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible, given the constraints. We can use a simple greedy approach to achieve this by iterating over the items and assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 99.
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most with a value of 89.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 74.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 93.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 96.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 94.
7. Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 86.
8. Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 79.

Given the allocations above, we can ensure that each agent has an integer number of items by making adjustments if necessary. However, in this scenario, adjustments are not necessary because each agent has been assigned based on the maximum value approach without exceeding the item limit.

Final Allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 4, 5, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents and considers the valuations of each agent for the items.
