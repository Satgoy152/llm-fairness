Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  33   7  25  97  72  22  69
1  28  95  77   3  36  20  78  94
2  28  47   2  14  20  64  79  71
3  60  25  38  75   8  62  98  92
4  20  23  61  97  90  99  61  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how to do this:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: Start by identifying which agent values each item the most.

2. **Assign items based on highest valuation**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item.

3. **Adjust for fairness**: If any agent ends up with no items, we will redistribute the items to ensure each agent receives at least one.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 47.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 95.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 77.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it the most at 97.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 values it the most at 99.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most at 98.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most at 92.

After initial allocations, we have:

- Agent 0: 0, 4
- Agent 1: 1, 2
- Agent 2: 
- Agent 3: 6, 7
- Agent 4: 3, 5

Agent 2 has no items, so we can adjust by reallocating an item from another agent. We will take item 0 from Agent 0 and assign it to Agent 2.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: 4
- Agent 1: 1, 2
- Agent 2: 0
- Agent 3: 6, 7
- Agent 4: 3, 5

Now, the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```
