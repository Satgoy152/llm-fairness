Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16   6  67  81  94  39  71  20
1  44  40  22  68  14  47  63  37
2  90  82  37  29  67  42  39  74
3   3  67   1  15  88  48  82   5
4  71  25  28  96  21  42  21  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Furthermore, we will ensure that all 8 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and make a decision on how to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (94), Item 3 (81), Item 6 (71)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (44), Item 5 (47), Item 6 (63)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (90), Item 1 (82), Item 7 (74)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (88), Item 1 (67), Item 6 (82)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (96), Item 0 (71), Item 5 (42)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate Item 4 (94), Item 6 (71)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate Item 5 (47)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate Item 0 (90), Item 7 (74)
- **Agent 3**: Allocate Item 1 (67)
- **Agent 4**: Allocate Item 3 (96), Item 2 (28)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction as per their valuations. Here's the JSON output for these allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 2]
}
```
