Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  76  56  62  13  59  49  46
1  72   9  10  10  48  69   7  77
2  58  50  47  51  61  42  71  66
3  22  64  86   5  18  12  79  20
4  26  73  24  86  17  99  27   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [72  9 10 10 48 69  7 77]
 [58 50 47 51 61 42 71 66]

 [26 73 24 86 17 99 27  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to give each agent the items that they value the most, while ensuring that all items are distributed. Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 1, 2, and 3 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 5 and 7 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 6 and 7 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 2 and 6 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly.

Let's assign the items as follows, trying to maximize the individual agent's value:

1. **Agent 0**: Gets items 0 and 1 (highest values: 83 and 76).
2. **Agent 1**: Gets item 7 (highest value: 77).
3. **Agent 2**: Gets item 6 (highest value: 71).
4. **Agent 3**: Gets item 2 (highest value: 86).
5. **Agent 4**: Gets items 3, 4, and 5 (highest values: 86, 17, and 99).

This ensures a fair allocation based on individual valuations and covers all 8 items.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
