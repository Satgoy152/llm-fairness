Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68   9  77  90  65   3   3  28
1  34  97  92  72  85  25  61  94
2  66  19  73  70  46  58   1  63
3  77  72  90  54  95  51  91  74
4  79  58  27  78  40  77  76  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here’s a possible strategy for allocation:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent assigns to an item and allocate that item to them if it hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Ensure all items are allocated while trying to maintain a balanced distribution.

Let's go through the process:

1. Assign the highest valued item to each agent:
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (value 90)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (value 97)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (value 66)
   - Agent 3: Item 4 (value 95)
   - Agent 4: Item 7 (value 86)

2. Allocate the remaining items:
   - Remaining items: 2, 5, 6
   - Agent 3 shows a strong preference for Item 6 (value 91), so assign Item 6 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 1 shows a strong preference for Item 2 (value 92), so assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 0 can take Item 5 as no agent has a strong preference for it.

Here’s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
