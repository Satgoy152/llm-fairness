Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  67  91  77  61  28  20  89
1  85  36  84  58  45  31  71  23
2  70  77  32   7  51  77  97  41
3  52  59  60  70  50  97  92  21
4   2  98  53  12  59  26  14  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. We aim to distribute the items in such a way that the total satisfaction (measured by the valuations) is maximized across all agents.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value = 91).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value = 36).
3. Assign items 5 and 6 to agent 2 (values = 77, 97).
4. Assign items 3 and 5 to agent 3 (values = 70, 97).
5. Assign items 4 and 7 to agent 4 (values = 59, 64).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 7, 0]
}
```

Note: The allocations aim to balance the distribution of items while trying to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. There could be other allocations that also satisfy the problem constraints.
