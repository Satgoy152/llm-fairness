Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  32  40  93   3   2  83  92
1  40  40  28  56  95  94  31  23
2   8  56  13  27  15  69  10  81
3  38  38  43  43  72  75  52  28
4  15  25   7  38  12  19  27  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to allocate items fairly among the agents, we can adopt a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A simple approach is to allocate items in a way that each agent receives the item they value the most among the remaining unallocated items. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Find the highest value for each agent among the remaining items.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the highest relative valuation.
3. Repeat until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (93).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (95).
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (81).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (75).
- Agent 4 values item 7 the highest (40), but item 7 is already allocated to agent 2.

Now, let's allocate the next highest valued items:

- Agent 0 has item 3.
- Agent 1 has item 4.
- Agent 2 has item 7.
- Agent 3 has item 5.
- Agent 4 receives the next highest valued item available, item 1 (25).

Continuing this strategy:

- Agent 0 receives item 6 (83), as it is still available and highly valued by Agent 0.
- Agent 1 receives item 2 (28), as it is still available and valued by Agent 1.
- Agent 3 receives item 0 (38), as it is still available and equally valued by Agent 3.

Now, all items are allocated. This allocation method aims to distribute items in a way that maximizes the individual agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations for the unallocated items. 

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5, 0],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while attempting to maximize satisfaction based on the given valuations.
