Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  94  80  26  31  52  59  41
1  48   0  65  56  88   5  35  55
2  66  16  44  71  98  28  37  60
3  84  53  27  29  39  17   4  14
4  65   8  35  73  94  48  83  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Identify high-value items for each agent and try to allocate them accordingly.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, or adjust to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 4.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 has relatively balanced low valuations, so we will allocate less competitive items to them.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 4 and 6.

Considering these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items [3]
- Agent 3: Items [7]
- Agent 4: Items [2, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
