Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  21  13  69  21  33  51  25
1  35  32  83  87  38  28  37  51
2  96  13  27  89  51  94  17  41
3  13  25  57   3  32  93  63  20
4  86  70   6  94   6  20  39  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Here’s how the allocation can be done:

1. Consider the valuations for each item by all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the highest.
3. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's go through each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the highest at 70.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 83.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the highest at 94.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the highest at 51.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the highest at 94.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the highest at 63.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the highest at 51.

Now, let’s present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has an integer number of items.
