Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  62  52  87  58  22  62  94
1  89  93   2  56  66  95  90  68
2  94  58   8  69  99  44  40  72
3  51  88  13  63  88  10  99  60
4  25   9  45  51   2  90  80  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[37 62 52 87 58 22 62 94]
 [89 93  2 56 66 95 90 68]
 [94 58  8 69 99 44 40 72]
 [51 88 13 63 88 10 99 60]
 [25  9 45 51  2 90 80 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to optimize the allocation such that each agent gets items they value highly. We also need to ensure each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with a strategy to assign items to agents based on their valuations:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign that item to the corresponding agent.
2. If there are conflicts (multiple agents valuing an item equally), try to resolve them by considering other high-value items for the conflicting agents.
3. Ensure each agent has at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 2 (94).
- Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 1 (93).
- Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 0 (52).
- Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 0 (87).
- Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 2 (99).
- Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 1 (95).
- Item 6: Highest value is by Agent 3 (99).
- Item 7: Highest value is by Agent 0 (94).

This allocation leaves Agent 4 without any items. We can adjust by looking at second-highest values and redistributing:

- Reassign Item 3 to Agent 3 (63) instead of Agent 0 (87).
- Reassign Item 0 to Agent 4 (25) instead of Agent 2 (94).

Here's the adjusted allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 3, 6
- Agent 4: Item 0

Now, in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
