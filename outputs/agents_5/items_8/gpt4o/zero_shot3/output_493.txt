Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  73  70  46  52  57  15  65
1  51  86  61  86  56  93  20  45
2  28  61  27  18  53  54  51  77
3  86  42  51  94  93  14  43  92
4  32  83  29   8  92  66  25  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Values for items are [92, 73, 70, 46, 52, 57, 15, 65]. The highest value is for item 0 (92). Allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Values for items are [51, 86, 61, 86, 56, 93, 20, 45]. The highest value is for item 5 (93). Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Values for items are [28, 61, 27, 18, 53, 54, 51, 77]. The highest value is for item 7 (77). Allocate item 7 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values for items are [86, 42, 51, 94, 93, 14, 43, 92]. The highest value is for item 3 (94). Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Values for items are [32, 83, 29, 8, 92, 66, 25, 77]. The highest value is for item 4 (92). Allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Now we have one item left to allocate (since we have given out 5 items so far), we will allocate the remaining items based on the highest remaining values:

- Remaining items: 1, 2, 6
- Agent 0 can take item 1 (value 73)
- Agent 1 can take item 2 (value 61)
- Agent 2 can take item 6 (value 51)

After distributing the remaining items based on the highest remaining values, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
