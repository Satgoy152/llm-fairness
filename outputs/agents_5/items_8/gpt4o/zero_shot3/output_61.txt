Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  48  73  59  23  77  81  48
1  28  88  91  54  96  23  41  14
2  92  45  31  43  82  66  63  96
3  70  70  17  40  41  67  21  94
4  87   9   8  37  38  96  30  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We will attempt to achieve a balanced distribution of total value and number of items across all agents.

Let's analyze the table and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0** values items 6 (81) and 5 (77) highly, so we assign these to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values items 4 (96) and 2 (91) highly, so we assign these to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values items 0 (92) and 7 (96) highly, so we assign these to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 (70) highly, so we assign this item to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 (96) highly, but it's already assigned to Agent 0. Thus, we assign item 3 (37) to Agent 4, which is the next highest available item for them.

Now we summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [1]
- Agent 4: Item [3]

This allocation efficiently considers each agent's preferences while ensuring all items are assigned.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
