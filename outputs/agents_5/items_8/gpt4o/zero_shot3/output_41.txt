Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  59  11  49  64  53  19  55
1   0  40  80  87  74  95  96  22
2  65  85  81  43   2  13  48  87
3  75  77  39  80   4  14  46  15
4  67  81  46  84  43  61  27  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while respecting their valuations, we need to consider both fairness and maximizing the total valuation for each agent. One approach is to try to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's how we might allocate the items:

1. Prioritize each agent's highest-valued items.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. Balance the total value each agent receives as evenly as possible.

Given these considerations, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest, followed by item 1.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest.

Allocating items based on these preferences while ensuring no item is allocated more than once, we can come up with the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2, 5, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 4, which they value at 64.
- Agent 1 gets item 6, which they value at 96.
- Agent 2 gets item 0, which they value at 65.
- Agent 3 gets item 3, which they value at 80.
- Agent 4 gets items 1, 2, 5, and 7, which they value at 81, 46, 61, and 24 respectively.

All 8 items are allocated, and each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations.
