Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  83  22  60  75  38  40  64
1  12  25  28  27  29   0  19  47
2  62  99  99  72  69  41   3   5
3  66  18  48  17   1   1  70  42
4  18  69   7  35  94  22  46  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a similar total valuation. This approach maximizes fairness by ensuring all agents receive a comparable value from their allocated items, though each agent's allocated items might differ due to their varying personal valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
    - Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly.
    - Items: [1, 5]
    - Total value: 83 + 38 = 121

2. Agent 1:
    - Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly.
    - Items: [2, 7]
    - Total value: 28 + 47 = 75

3. Agent 2:
    - Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly.
    - Items: [0, 3]
    - Total value: 62 + 72 = 134

4. Agent 3:
    - Allocate items that Agent 3 values highly.
    - Item: [6]
    - Total value: 70

5. Agent 4:
    - Allocate items that Agent 4 values highly.
    - Item: [4]
    - Total value: 94

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent getting a fair share based on their individual valuations.
