Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  78  70  76  72   2  66   1
1  73  21   0  54  22  50  92  65
2  20  26  31  86  80  78  50  92
3  59  75  12   8  77  37  94  98
4  40  92  56  69  66  86  70  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to consider the preferences of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can try to match agents with items they value highly, while balancing the total number of items each agent receives. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 highly. We can assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most. We can assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 the most. We can assign item 7 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most. We can assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most. We can assign item 1 to agent 4.

Next, we allocate the remaining items:

6. Agent 0 also values item 2 and item 3. We can assign item 2 to agent 0.
7. Agent 1 also values item 4. We can assign item 4 to agent 1.
8. Agent 3 also values item 3. We can assign item 3 to agent 3.

With this allocation, every item is allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
