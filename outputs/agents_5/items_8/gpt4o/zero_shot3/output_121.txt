Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  59  99  21  36  60  41  15
1   9  41  27  93  20  44  28  22
2  20  78  46   8  35  35  90  94
3   9  49  16  54  91  65  51  31
4  11   5  18  83  82  75  17  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the total value of the items as evenly as possible among all agents, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

The total value of all items for each agent is calculated as follows:

- Agent 0: 75 + 59 + 99 + 21 + 36 + 60 + 41 + 15 = 406
- Agent 1: 9 + 41 + 27 + 93 + 20 + 44 + 28 + 22 = 284
- Agent 2: 20 + 78 + 46 + 8 + 35 + 35 + 90 + 94 = 406
- Agent 3: 9 + 49 + 16 + 54 + 91 + 65 + 51 + 31 = 366
- Agent 4: 11 + 5 + 18 + 83 + 82 + 75 + 17 + 78 = 369

Total value of all items: 406 + 284 + 406 + 366 + 369 = 1831

The average value per agent, if divided equally, would be 1831 / 5 = 366.2.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing fairness:

1. Assign the highest value items to agents that have lower total values to balance the distribution.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: [2] (Value: 99)
- Agent 1: [3] (Value: 93)
- Agent 2: [6, 7] (Value: 90 + 94 = 184)
- Agent 3: [4, 5] (Value: 91 + 65 = 156)
- Agent 4: [0, 1] (Value: 75 + 59 = 134)

This allocation attempts to balance the high-value items across agents, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The total number of items allocated is 8, meeting the requirement. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This distribution is designed to maximize fairness given the constraints.
