Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  58  40   5  16  79  52  56
1  38  18  28  85  70  43  97   2
2  72  25   0  46  71  65  14  97
3  37  51  63  18  78  51  60  17
4  86  15  47  62   3  18  27   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [86 15 47 62  3 18 27  1]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will try to distribute the items based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item, ensuring each item is only allocated once.

Let's examine the valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  58  40   5  16  79  52  56
1  38  18  28  85  70  43  97   2
2  72  25   0  46  71  65  14  97
3  37  51  63  18  78  51  60  17
4  86  15  47  62   3  18  27   1
```

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 79. Assign item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest at 97. Assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 the highest at 97. Assign item 7 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 78. Assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest at 86. Assign item 0 to agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining 3 items (1, 2, 3) to the agents with the next highest preferences:

6. Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 58, which is the highest unallocated value. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
7. Item 2: Agent 3 values it at 63, which is the highest unallocated value. Assign item 2 to agent 3.
8. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 85, which is the highest unallocated value. Assign item 3 to agent 1.

All items have now been allocated. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4, 2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
