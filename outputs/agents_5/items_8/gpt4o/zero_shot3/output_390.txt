Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  94  67   2  94  16  36  69
1  48  59  56  59  65  60  94  11
2  22  96  76  97  47  37  14  14
3  79  98  75  57  82  94  20  81
4  94  31  61  26  26  52  25  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all 8 items are distributed. We can approach this problem using a simple greedy algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, and then adjust as necessary to ensure fairness.

Let's break down the allocations step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 with 94. Assign Item 0 to Agent 4.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 98. Assign Item 1 to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 with 76. Assign Item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 with 97. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 and Agent 1 both at 94. To ensure fairness, let's assign it to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 94. Assign Item 5 to Agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with 94. Assign Item 6 to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 81. Assign Item 7 to Agent 3.

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least one item where possible and adjust if necessary. Here's a fair allocation based on the above approach:

- Agent 0: Items [4]
- Agent 1: Items [6]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 3: Items [1, 5, 7]
- Agent 4: Items [0]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent with the highest bid for an item gets priority.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 5, 7],
    "4": [0]
}
```
