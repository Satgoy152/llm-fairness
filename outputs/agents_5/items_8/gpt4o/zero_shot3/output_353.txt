Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  69  63  23  27  70  45  19
1   0   1  57  63  60  95  16  65
2  78  66  35  90  54  12  79  71
3  75  65  27  11  16  57  22  55
4   7  68  66  93  81  81  97   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can follow an approach that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign the items to agents based on their highest preferences. Start by assigning the item with the highest value to each agent until each agent has at least one item.
2. After each agent has at least one item, continue assigning the remaining items to the agents in a manner that maximizes their individual valuations.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 74.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 95.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 90.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 75, but it's already taken, so we move to their next highest, which is item 1 at 65.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the highest at 97.

Now, each agent has one item. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items:

1. The remaining items are 2, 4, and 7.
2. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 63, so we assign item 2 to agent 0.
3. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest at 81, so we assign item 4 to agent 4.
4. Agent 1 values item 7 the highest at 65, so we assign item 7 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 4]
}
```
