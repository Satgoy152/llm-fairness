Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  20  34  78   7  64  32  10
1  90   6  60  25  97   3   0  48
2  80  13  33  22  27  52  70  23
3  39  13  37   1  64  44  88  29
4  57  50  73  48  40  13  82  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute them in a way that balances the overall satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, one agent will receive 1 more item than the others. We will try to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent for the items they receive.

Here is one possible fair allocation of items to agents:

1. Agent 0 could receive items 0 and 3.
2. Agent 1 could receive items 4 and 7.
3. Agent 2 could receive items 5 and 6.
4. Agent 3 could receive items 2.
5. Agent 4 could receive item 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent's allocation attempts to maximize their satisfaction while distributing all 8 items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
