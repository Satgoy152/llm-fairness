Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45   3   0  21  75  45  41  46
1  20  65  19  74   5  59  47  20
2  39  56  52  65  73  55  68  85
3  61  47  16  20  54  73  72  35
4  13   5   2  72  79  98   1   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction with their allocation, considering their valuations for the items. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's how we can perform the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 61 by agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 65 by agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 52 by agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 74 by agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 79 by agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 98 by agent 4.
7. **Item 6**: The highest value is 72 by agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: The highest value is 85 by agent 2.

Ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible, we adjust allocations to ensure fairness:

- Agent 0 should get at least one item, so we can give them item 0 (their highest value after item 3 and 7).
- Agent 1 should get item 1 and item 3 based on their highest values.
- Agent 2 should get item 2 and item 7 based on their highest values.
- Agent 3 should get item 6 based on their highest value.
- Agent 4 should get item 4 and item 5 based on their highest values.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
