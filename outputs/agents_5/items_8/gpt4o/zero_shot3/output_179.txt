Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90   8   1  55  71  35  24  36
1  28  70  11  15  98  48  28  64
2  55  67  79   9  15  93  14   1
3   7  98  42  62  61  63  94  75
4   7  22  47  94   8  12  76   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can attempt to optimize the allocation so that each agent gets items with high personal value. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 4 (98).
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 5 (93).
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 1 (98).
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (94).
6. **Allocate remaining items**: Items 2, 6, and 7 should be allocated to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring fairness.

Based on this, here's one way to fairly allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Assign item 3 to agent 4.
- For the remaining items, assign:
  - Item 2 to agent 2 (second highest valuation at 79).
  - Item 6 to agent 3 (highest remaining valuation at 94).
  - Item 7 to agent 3 (highest remaining valuation at 75).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [1, 6, 7],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize the individual valuation for each allocated item.
