Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  80  43  62  36  53  68  70
1  62  90  75  38  13  72  92  49
2  74  96  70  25  37  29  11  52
3  13  77  10  81   1  20  63  18
4  87  94  88  69  17  70   4  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[77 80 43 62 36 53 68 70]
 [62 90 75 38 13 72 92 49]
 [74 96 70 25 37 29 11 52]
 [13 77 10 81  1 20 63 18]
 [87 94 88 69 17 70  4 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can take into account the valuations provided in the table. One approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuation table:

1. Assign agent 0 the item with the highest valuation for them.
2. Repeat this for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
3. Consider remaining items and allocate them based on maximizing the total valuation.

Given the constraints, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1 (80)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (92)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (70)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (81)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (87)
- Remaining items: 4, 5, 7

Allocate the remaining items based on the maximum valuation:

- Agent 0: Item 7 (70)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (72)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (37)

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all the items are allocated.
