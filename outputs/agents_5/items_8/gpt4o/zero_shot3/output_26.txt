Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  22  78  38  70  76  83  84
1  44  21  78  90  32  47  98  73
2  55  61  53  52  71  52  26  99
3  50   8  57  90  78  75   2  92
4  46  12  82  79  66  35  91  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that the overall distribution is as balanced as possible given the valuations. One common approach is to use a method like the "maximum envy-free" method, where allocations aim to minimize envy among agents based on their valuations.

Let's attempt a simple allocation by evaluating the highest bids for each item and assigning items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

1. **Item 0:** 
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (55).

2. **Item 1:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (61).

3. **Item 2:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 0 and Agent 1 (78). Assign to Agent 0 to balance distribution.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 and Agent 3 (90). Assign to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (70).

6. **Item 5:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (76).

7. **Item 6:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (98).

8. **Item 7:**
   - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (99).

Now, we can check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 7
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: No items

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 1, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": []
}
``` 

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and attempts to balance the agents' highest valuations while keeping the distribution fair.
