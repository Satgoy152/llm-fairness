Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  38  56  27  66  18  58  31
1  61  80  81  77  73  92  77   9
2  54  23  29  37  78  14  13   2
3  99  48  72  34  24  23  26  41
4  13  52  39  13  65  35   2   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 5 agents, we can use a simple algorithm that considers each agent's valuations and tries to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. We will allocate items by iterating through agents and assigning the item with the highest valuation available to them, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 99), so we assign item 0 to agent 3.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 92), so we assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 81), so we assign item 2 to agent 1.
4. Agent 3 has the next highest valuation for item 1 (value 48), so we assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 78), so we assign item 4 to agent 2.
6. Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 6 (value 58), so we assign item 6 to agent 0.
7. Agent 0 has the next highest valuation for item 3 (value 27), so we assign item 3 to agent 0.
8. Agent 4 has the remaining item 7, so we assign item 7 to agent 4.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item if possible.
