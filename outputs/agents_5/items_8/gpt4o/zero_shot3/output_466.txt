Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  71  60  81   4  85  84  11
1  20  71  30  96  22  95  92  89
2   5  52  12  63  94  38   6  53
3  92  79  25  27  50  83  12  26
4  99  66  88  25  87  65  87  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations while each agent ends up with an integer number of items. Since there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring a fair distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 5 (values 34 and 85)
2. **Agent 1**: Items 3 and 6 (values 96 and 92)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 4 (value 94)
4. **Agent 3**: Items 1 and 7 (values 79 and 26)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 2 (value 88)

This allocation tries to distribute the items so that the agents receive items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```
