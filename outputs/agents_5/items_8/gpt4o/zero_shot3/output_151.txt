Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  11  51  61   3  17  94  29
1  54  30  28  27  77  82  87  38
2  71  75  34  31  79  76  21  69
3  27  48  76  52  17  97   7  77
4  16  54  96  70  58  59  50  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given the valuations in the table, let's try to distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Based on the highest valuation, Agent 0 should get item 6 (value 94).

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 5 (value 82).

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 4 (value 79).

4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 5 (value 97), but it is already allocated, so the next highest is item 7 (value 77).

5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 2 (value 96).

Now, let's distribute the remaining items considering the next highest valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 0 (value 79).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest is item 6 (value 87), but it is already allocated, so the next highest is item 4 (value 77).
- **Agent 2**: Next highest is item 1 (value 75).
- **Agent 3**: After item 7, the next highest is item 3 (value 52).
- **Agent 4**: After item 2, the next highest is item 7 (value 87), but it is already allocated, so the next highest is item 3 (value 70).

Adjusting this to ensure all items are allocated:

- **Item 0**: Allocated to Agent 0
- **Item 1**: Allocated to Agent 2
- **Item 2**: Allocated to Agent 4
- **Item 3**: Allocated to Agent 3
- **Item 4**: Allocated to Agent 1
- **Item 5**: Allocated to Agent 1
- **Item 6**: Allocated to Agent 0
- **Item 7**: Allocated to Agent 3

Allocating these items results in:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
