Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  71  60  83  90   4  20  98
1  24  55   8  25  46  70  80   4
2  60  10  15  32  28  46  36  72
3  73  88  92  39  52  15  50  93
4  85  11  73  73  74  31  83  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations, given that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is a possible allocation that attempts to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 the highest. Assign item 7 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest. Assign item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest. Assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the highest. Assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest. Assign item 4 to agent 4.
6. Agent 3 also values item 3 highly after item 2. Assign item 3 to agent 3.
7. Agent 0 also values item 4 highly after item 7, but it's already allocated, so we move to the next highest, item 1. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
8. Agent 1 also values item 5 highly after item 6. Assign item 5 to agent 1.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

Each agent is assigned an integer number of items, and a total of 8 items are allocated.
