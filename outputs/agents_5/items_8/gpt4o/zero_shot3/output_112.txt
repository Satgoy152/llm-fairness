Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  54   1   8  14  89  43  57
1  75  32  81  35  33  14   0  38
2  97  18  16  10  49  68  76  42
3  69  22  58  30  40  47  64  58
4  34  27  24  82  67  73   2  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Values are: [38, 54, 1, 8, 14, 89, 43, 57]
   - Highest value: Item 5 (89)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values are: [75, 32, 81, 35, 33, 14, 0, 38]
   - Highest value: Item 2 (81)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values are: [97, 18, 16, 10, 49, 68, 76, 42]
   - Highest value: Item 0 (97)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values are: [69, 22, 58, 30, 40, 47, 64, 58]
   - Highest value: Item 6 (64)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Values are: [34, 27, 24, 82, 67, 73, 2, 70]
   - Highest value: Item 3 (82)

Using this strategy, let's allocate the highest valued item for each agent, then distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 0:** Allocated item 5 (Value: 89)
- **Agent 1:** Allocated item 2 (Value: 81)
- **Agent 2:** Allocated item 0 (Value: 97)
- **Agent 3:** Allocated item 6 (Value: 64)
- **Agent 4:** Allocated item 3 (Value: 82)

Now we need to allocate the remaining items [1, 4, 7]:

- **Agent 0:** Allocated item 1 (Value: 54)
- **Agent 4:** Allocated item 4 (Value: 67)
- **Agent 3:** Allocated item 7 (Value: 58)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item. Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
