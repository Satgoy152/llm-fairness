Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  41  17  44  70  26  72  66
1  86  59  38  23  23  87  36  85
2  66   7  41  82  88  49  12  75
3  18  66  44  20  96  55  79  56
4  30  78  61  65  44  36  65  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can apply a method that attempts to maximize the individual valuations of the items for each agent and ensures each agent receives at least one item. A simple way is to allocate the highest valued item for each agent first, then proceed with the next highest valued unallocated items, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 6 with a value of 72.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 5 with a value of 87.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 4 with a value of 88.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 4 with a value of 96, but since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 2, we allocate the next highest value item - item 6 with a value of 79 - to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is item 1 with a value of 78.

Now we have allocated items 1, 4, 5, 6, and each agent has at least one item. We still have items 0, 2, 3, 7 to allocate.

6. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1, as the second highest value for Agent 1 after item 5 is item 0 with a value of 86.
7. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4, as the second highest value for Agent 4 after item 1 is item 2 with a value of 61.
8. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as the second highest value for Agent 2 after item 4 is item 3 with a value of 82.
9. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3, as the second highest value for Agent 3 after item 6 is item 7 with a value of 56.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items of relatively high value to them and all items are distributed. Here's the solution in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```
