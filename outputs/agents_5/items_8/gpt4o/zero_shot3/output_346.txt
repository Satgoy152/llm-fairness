Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  63  62  41  83  26  38  17
1  78   5  48  55  36  55  15  18
2  92  98  96  48  41  70  14  86
3  53  68  56  35   1  77  73  62
4  80  45  77  24  56  63  86  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 5 agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. This approach generally tries to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, within the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0. 
   
2. **Agent 1:**  
   Agent 1 has relatively lower valuations compared to others, but they have some interest in item 3.

3. **Agent 2:**  
   Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 7. We can assign one of these to them.

4. **Agent 3:**  
   Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5.

5. **Agent 4:**  
   Agent 4 has a high valuation for items 6 and 4.

Here's how we can distribute the items:

- Agent 0: [0] (since they have high valuation for item 0)
- Agent 1: [3] (since they have some interest in item 3)
- Agent 2: [1, 7] (since they have high valuations for these items)
- Agent 3: [5] (high valuation for item 5)
- Agent 4: [2, 4, 6] (high valuations for these items)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 4, 6]
}
```
