Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98   1  92  82  39  72  93  12
1  17   8   5  65  90  38  33  60
2  77  54  76  61  84  84  79  46
3  32   2  10  90  86  55  86  88
4  91   4  42  75  54  62  79  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98  1 92 82 39 72 93 12]
 [17  8  5 65 90 38 33 60]
 [77 54 76 61 84 84 79 46]
 [32  2 10 90 86 55 86 88]
 [91  4 42 75 54 62 79 19]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item when possible, given that there are more items than agents.

Here's one possible fair allocation based on the valuations:

1. Agent 0: Item 0 (value 98), Item 2 (value 92)
2. Agent 1: Item 4 (value 90)
3. Agent 2: Item 6 (value 79)
4. Agent 3: Item 3 (value 90), Item 7 (value 88)
5. Agent 4: Item 5 (value 62), Item 1 (value 4)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and maximizes the overall valuation based on the provided table.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [5, 1]
}
```
