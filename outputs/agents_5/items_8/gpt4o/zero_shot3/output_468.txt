Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  31  47  13  87  69  31  21
1  72  42  28  72  32  65  47  12
2   3  35  61  65  35  26  64  17
3  93  34   2  30  70  88  73   8
4  40  63  55  25  99  66  83  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. We can use a common method called the "round-robin" approach, where each agent selects the most valuable remaining item for them in turns. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Start with Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (87). Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. Next, Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (72). Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. Next, Agent 2:
   - Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (65). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. Next, Agent 3:
   - Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (88). Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. Next, Agent 4:
   - Agent 4 values item 4 the highest, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 6 (83). Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

6. Back to Agent 0:
   - Agent 0's next highest available is item 2 (47). Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

7. Agent 1:
   - Next highest available for Agent 1 is item 5, but it's taken. Next is item 1 (42). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

8. Agent 2:
   - Remaining items are 7. Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
