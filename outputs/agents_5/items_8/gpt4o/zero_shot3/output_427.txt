Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  40   4  91  58  98  82  82
1  58  79  59  10   0  21  84  84
2  67  67  35  21  79  34  79  91
3  77  87  35  36  39   6  40  89
4  60  89  88  16  47  93  47   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an approximately equal number of items, and also consider the values each agent has for the items to ensure fairness and maximize total satisfaction.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 3 and 5. Assign these items to Agent 0.
   - Allocated items: [3, 5]

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 1 and 6. Assign these items to Agent 1.
   - Allocated items: [1, 6]

3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a high value for item 7. Assign this item to Agent 2.
   - Allocated items: [7]

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 highly. Assign this item to Agent 3.
   - Allocated items: [0]

5. **Agent 4**: This agent has high valuations for items 4 and 2. Assign these items to Agent 4.
   - Allocated items: [2, 4]

Now, let's ensure that all 8 items are allocated, and the distribution is fair, meaning each agent should ideally get one or two items, as close as possible given there are 8 items and 5 agents. The allocation above achieves this:

- Agent 0: 2 items
- Agent 1: 2 items
- Agent 2: 1 item
- Agent 3: 1 item
- Agent 4: 2 items

This allocation uses all 8 items and distributes them fairly among the agents. Below is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
