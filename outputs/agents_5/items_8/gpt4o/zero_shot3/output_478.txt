Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  61  92  15  26  69  62  35
1  12  68   7  98  19   7  48  53
2  31  76  17  61  77  82  95  77
3  67   9  41  53  57  55  83  65
4   8  20  59  23  15  50  28  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent given their preferences. We'll try to ensure that each item is assigned such that it benefits the agents as much as possible.

Let's consider each item's valuation across all agents and assign it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Valuations: [35, 12, 31, 67, 8] - Assign to Agent 3 (value: 67)
2. **Item 1**: Valuations: [61, 68, 76, 9, 20] - Assign to Agent 2 (value: 76)
3. **Item 2**: Valuations: [92, 7, 17, 41, 59] - Assign to Agent 0 (value: 92)
4. **Item 3**: Valuations: [15, 98, 61, 53, 23] - Assign to Agent 1 (value: 98)
5. **Item 4**: Valuations: [26, 19, 77, 57, 15] - Assign to Agent 2 (value: 77)
6. **Item 5**: Valuations: [69, 7, 82, 55, 50] - Assign to Agent 2 (value: 82)
7. **Item 6**: Valuations: [62, 48, 95, 83, 28] - Assign to Agent 2 (value: 95)
8. **Item 7**: Valuations: [35, 53, 77, 65, 40] - Assign to Agent 2 (value: 77)

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, and distribute the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 1, 4, 5, 6, 7
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: No items, as all have been allocated

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4, 5, 6, 7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while also attempting to distribute items fairly among the agents.
