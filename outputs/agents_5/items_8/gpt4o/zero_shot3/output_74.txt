Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  12  42  39  38  19  17  58
1  74  30  54  41  90  93  70  95
2  77  48  71  78  44  96  51  44
3  55  45   1  54  42  64  37  53
4  29  18  25  55  54  52  89  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we can look for an allocation strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed. Let's use a greedy approach where each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Initial Allocation by Highest Valuation:**
    - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item:**
    - If any agent does not receive an item in the initial allocation, reallocate from another agent who has more than one item, starting with reallocating the item with the lowest valuation difference.

Letâ€™s proceed with the allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation:**
    - Item 0: Agent 2 (77)
    - Item 1: Agent 2 (48)
    - Item 2: Agent 2 (71)
    - Item 3: Agent 2 (78)
    - Item 4: Agent 1 (90)
    - Item 5: Agent 2 (96)
    - Item 6: Agent 4 (89)
    - Item 7: Agent 1 (95)

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item:**
    - Agents 0 and 3 do not have any items. We need to reallocate some items to them.

3. **Reallocation:**
    - Since Agent 2 has many items, we can reallocate some of those.
    - Reallocate Item 1 from Agent 2 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it at 12 and it is the least valuable item for Agent 2 of what they have).
    - Reallocate Item 3 from Agent 2 to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 values it at 54 and it is another least valuable item for Agent 2).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [4, 7]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [6]

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6]
}
```
