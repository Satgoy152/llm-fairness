Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  87  50  51  28  67  32  41
1  26  59  65  61  58  44  55  95
2  69  39  94   3  82   3  47  55
3  34  96   8  86   1  29  28  54
4  22  60  76  97  22  60  97  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 7.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 but that conflicts with Agent 0, so we will consider their next highest valuation, which is item 3.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 3, 6, and 7. Since item 3 is taken by Agent 3 and item 7 by Agent 1, the next best for Agent 4 is item 6.

Based on this analysis and ensuring that every item is allocated, let's create a fair distribution:

1. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 as their second choice.
7. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2 as their next best choice.
8. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 as their next best choice.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations, and all 8 items are distributed.
