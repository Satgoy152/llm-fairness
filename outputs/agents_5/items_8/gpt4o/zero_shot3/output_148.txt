Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  69  48  17  35  65  28  23
1  63  66  40  66  48  59  50  29
2  54  63  99  51  38  39  28  60
3  17  58   1  11   5  61  16  60
4  62  92  46  42  59  85  69  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 58  1 11  5 61 16 60]
 [62 92 46 42 59 85 69 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value, if possible. Given there are 5 agents and 8 items, not every agent will necessarily get an item, but we should aim for a balanced distribution of value.

The allocations below aim to balance the total valuation across the agents as evenly as possible:

- Agent 0: [1, 7]
- Agent 1: [4, 5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [0, 6]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair value based on their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
