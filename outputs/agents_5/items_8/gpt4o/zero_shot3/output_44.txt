Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  54  42  97  56  31  66   1
1  82  38  64  54  74  72  72  35
2  58  76  97  66  20  87  58  33
3  55  30  63  86  71  54  35  35
4  50  16  41  63  57   4  88  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations to ensure each agent receives a fair share of value. One approach is to use a method inspired by the "maximin" fairness principle, where we try to maximize the minimum value received by any agent.

Here, I'll allocate the items by considering each agent's highest-valued items first while keeping fairness in mind. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 with a valuation of 97. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 0 with a valuation of 82. Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 2 with a valuation of 97. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 3 with a valuation of 86, but it's already allocated. Next is item 4 with a valuation of 71. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 6 with a valuation of 88. Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 out of 8 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items:

6. **Agent 0**: Next highest value is item 6, but it is allocated. The next available is item 0 (65), but it is also allocated. The next available with highest value is item 1 (54). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1**: Next highest value is item 5 with a valuation of 72. Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
8. **Agent 2**: Next highest value is item 3, but it is allocated. Next available is item 7 with a valuation of 33. Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

The allocation is complete, and each agent has received at least one item. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6]
}
```
