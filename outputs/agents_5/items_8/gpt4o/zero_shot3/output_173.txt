Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   1  28  52  29  46  39  55  22
1  86  35   8   0   6  65   0   8
2  73  44  28  60  90  99  59   3
3  80  26  28   5  56  83  18  92
4  88  88   3  75  62  54  34   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction (valuation) for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, or as equitably as possible. Let's work through this step by step:

1. **Calculate Preferences:**
   - Determine each agent's preference for the items based on the given valuations.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations that have not yet been assigned to another agent.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   - Ensure each agent has at least one item, if possible, and adjust to balance the total number of items allocated.

Let's apply this approach:

- **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are 55 (item 6), 52 (item 2), and 46 (item 4). 
- **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are 86 (item 0) and 65 (item 5).
- **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are 99 (item 5) and 90 (item 4).
- **Agent 3:** Highest valuations are 92 (item 7) and 83 (item 5).
- **Agent 4:** Highest valuations are 88 (item 0) and 88 (item 1).

**Allocation Strategy:**

- **Agent 0:** Give item 6 (valuation 55).
- **Agent 1:** Give item 0 (valuation 86).
- **Agent 2:** Give item 5 (valuation 99).
- **Agent 3:** Give item 7 (valuation 92).
- **Agent 4:** Give item 1 (valuation 88).

Now, the remaining items are 2, 3, and 4.

- **Agent 0:** Assign item 2 (valuation 52).
- **Agent 3:** Assign item 4 (valuation 56).
- **Agent 4:** Assign item 3 (valuation 75).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their preferences based on the given valuations.

**Final Allocations in JSON Format:**
```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7, 4],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```
