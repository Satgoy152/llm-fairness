Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  65   0  21  41  37  30  63
1  10  70  62  84  19  31  54  13
2  19  10  35  22  63   2  13   2
3  76  95  65   3  30  74  59  35
4  47   5  14  93  16  37  40  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. We can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high value for items 1 and 7.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 0 and 5 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 7 highly, but since item 7 is already allocated to Agent 0, Agent 4 can get items that are less competitive.

Based on this analysis, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 7
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 0, 5
- Agent 4: Items 2, 6

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```
