Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32  92  90  81  32  71  82  45
1  54  56  71  23   4  60  29  50
2  92  36  70  29  56   6  54  14
3  11  30  56  15  43  12  32  79
4  60  71  25  92   5  43  34  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a "maximum sum of valuations" approach. This involves assigning items to the agents in such a way that the total valuation across all agents is maximized. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Start by looking for the highest-valued item for each agent and allocate accordingly.
2. Continue assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Check if each agent has at least one item and adjust if needed to ensure fairness.

Let's allocate the items based on the valuations:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (92).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (71).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (92).
4. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3 (92).
5. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 7 (79).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as it has a high valuation (60) and Agent 1 has only one item currently.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as it has a high valuation (82) and Agent 0 has only one item currently.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as it has a reasonably high valuation (5) compared to Agent 3 and Agent 2 for the remaining items.

Final allocations ensure all items are allocated, and each agent receives items:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
