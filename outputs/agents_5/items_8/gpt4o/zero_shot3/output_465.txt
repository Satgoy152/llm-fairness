Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  47  26  69  26  32   0  37
1  64  39  43  11  76  89  17  97
2  12   3  98  47  89  45  21  50
3   2  73  53   1   6  47  52  40
4  56  68  12  31  64  10  90  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 47 26 69 26 32  0 37]
 [64 39 43 11 76 89 17 97]
 [12  3 98 47 89 45 21 50]
 [ 2 73 53  1  6 47 52 40]
 [56 68 12 31 64 10 90 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's analyze the valuation table and allocate the items accordingly.

1. Agent 1 should get item 7 since it has the highest value (97).
2. Agent 2 should get item 2 as it has the highest value (98).
3. Agent 3 should get item 1 because it has a relatively high value (73).
4. Agent 4 should receive item 6 because it has the highest value (90).
5. Agent 1 should also receive item 5 as it has a high value (89).
6. Agent 4 should also get item 4 since it has a high value (64).
7. Agent 0 should receive item 3 as it has the highest value for them (69).
8. Agent 0 should also get item 0 because it has the highest remaining value (25).

After this allocation, all 8 items are distributed among the agents. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
