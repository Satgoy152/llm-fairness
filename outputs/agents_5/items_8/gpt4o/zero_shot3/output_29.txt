Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53   3  55  76  99  69   9  14
1  54  87  85  95  31  59  32  81
2  44  72  70  80  95  62  31   3
3  82  70  89  83  64  37  64  21
4  39  88   7  17  69  98   7  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that considers the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most. 
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure all items are allocated and each agent has an integer number of items.

Based on these steps, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4
- Agent 3: Items 6
- Agent 4: Items 7

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agents receive items based on their valuations to the best extent possible.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
