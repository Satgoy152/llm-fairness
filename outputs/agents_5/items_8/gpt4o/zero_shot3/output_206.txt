Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  48  11  23  30  65  22   2
1  23  73   6  86  81  12  31  47
2  60  85  90  95  95  43  68  68
3   4  32  31  14   0  60  36   5
4  96  71  82  17  43   5  16  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others, but we should try to balance the distribution based on valuations.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Start by allocating items with the highest individual valuations first, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible.
2. Then, distribute remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (99). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 3 (86). Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (95) but it is already taken, so we allocate item 2 (90) to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 (60) the most. Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 0 (96), but it is already taken, so allocate item 2 (82) which is the next highest available.

At this stage, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items.

6. Allocate item 6 (68) to Agent 2, as it is one of the highest remaining values (68).
7. Allocate item 1 (48) to Agent 0, as it is the highest remaining value for them.
8. Allocate item 4 (43) to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated all 8 items. Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the items given the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible, and all items are distributed.
