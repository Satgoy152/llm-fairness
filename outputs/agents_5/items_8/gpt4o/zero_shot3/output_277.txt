Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  77  78  10  80  77  34  89
1  70  45  31  17  26  81  12  14
2  45  31  41   5  64   5  16  46
3  92  76  46  29  58  17  82  68
4  37  58  28  48  44   3  62  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. In this scenario, since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. 

One possible approach is to iterate through the items and allocate them to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that no agent receives more than 2 items initially. Then, distribute any remaining items to agents with fewer allocations, prioritizing those who value them highly. 

Let's go through the allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (92)
   - Allocate to Agent 3

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (77)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (78)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value: Agent 4 (48)
   - Allocate to Agent 4

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (80)
   - Allocate to Agent 0

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (81)
   - Allocate to Agent 1

7. **Item 6**:
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (82)
   - Allocate to Agent 3

8. **Item 7**:
   - Highest value: Agent 4 (93)
   - Allocate to Agent 4

Now let's ensure each agent gets a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 has 3 items (1, 2, 4)
- Agent 1 has 1 item (5)
- Agent 2 has 0 items
- Agent 3 has 2 items (0, 6)
- Agent 4 has 2 items (3, 7)

Since Agent 2 has no items, we can adjust the allocation slightly to ensure some fairness:

Revised Allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Allocate to Agent 3

2. **Item 1**:
   - Allocate to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**:
   - Allocate to Agent 0

4. **Item 3**:
   - Allocate to Agent 4

5. **Item 4**:
   - Allocate to Agent 1 (Instead of Agent 0, to give Agent 1 another item)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Allocate to Agent 1

7. **Item 6**:
   - Allocate to Agent 3

8. **Item 7**:
   - Allocate to Agent 4

After ensuring fair distribution, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 2: Items []
- Agent 3: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 7]

Now, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items while considering the highest valuations for each item.
