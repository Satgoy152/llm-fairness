Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  89  15  74   3  62   2  16
1  16  13  82  50  69  19  95  96
2  70  71  97  33  13  29  22  34
3  90  39  97   0  28  46  29   4
4  94   5  98   5  97  66  13  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent has an integer number of items and that all items are distributed. One approach is to assign items based on maximizing each agent's individual valuation for those items, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. We start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most:

   - Item 0: Agent 4 (valuation 94)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (valuation 89)
   - Item 2: Agent 4 (valuation 98)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (valuation 74)
   - Item 4: Agent 4 (valuation 97)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (valuation 62)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (valuation 95)
   - Item 7: Agent 1 (valuation 96)

2. Make sure each agent has been assigned a fair number of items and adjust if necessary to ensure all items are allocated:

   - Agent 0: [1, 3, 5]
   - Agent 1: [6, 7]
   - Agent 2: []
   - Agent 3: []
   - Agent 4: [0, 2, 4]

Now, let's present the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 2, 4]
}
```
