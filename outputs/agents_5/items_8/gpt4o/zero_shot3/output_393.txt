Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  71  42  63  19  55  32  24
1  27  33  33  66  14  60  63  53
2  56  43  98   4   7  43  27  88
3  22  21  88  12  85  43  54  13
4  65  70  83  18   5   4  99  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method where each agent is assigned items based on their valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more than one item.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify Preferences:** First, let's identify which items each agent values the most. This will help in making sure each agent gets at least one item they highly value.

2. **Assign Items:** Start by assigning the highest valued item to each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Then, allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valued items that haven't been assigned yet.

3. **Ensure Fairness:** Make sure that no agent gets all low-valued items unless unavoidable. Attempt to balance the allocations based on the overall value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most, so assign item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most, so assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most, so assign item 4 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most, but it's already assigned, so assign the next highest value item, which is 2 for agent 4. However, it's also assigned, so assign item 7 to agent 4.

Now, the remaining items are 1, 3, and 5. Let's assign them based on remaining preferences:

- Agent 0 has the next highest value for item 1, assign it to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the next highest value for item 3, assign it to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the next highest value for item 5, assign it to agent 2.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items have been allocated fairly.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the items are distributed based on their valuations.
