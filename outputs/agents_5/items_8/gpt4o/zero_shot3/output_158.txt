Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  32   4  66   1  29  66  92  15
1  29  63   6  53  13  13  29  19
2  67  35  75  32  16  92  91   4
3  78  62   2  95  73  83  97  69
4  52  32  95  30  66  89  82  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations given by each agent. This approach aims to give each agent the items they value the most while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Value highest for item 6 (92)
   - Value second highest for item 2 (66)
   - Value third highest for item 0 (32)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Value highest for item 1 (63)
   - Value second highest for item 3 (53)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Value highest for item 5 (92)
   - Value second highest for item 6 (91)
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Value highest for item 7 (69)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Value highest for item 4 (66)

Now, let's allocate these items to the agents based on their highest valuations:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

This ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, using all 8 items. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction based on their valuation.
