Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  87  63  66  56  35  79   0
1  19  97  32  21  96  76  79  39
2  51  61  34  97  90  41  42  42
3  17  53  41  17  24  11  26  93
4  21  47  84  72  73  47   3  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Start by identifying the highest valuations each agent has for the items and allocate those items to the respective agents if they are the highest amongst all agents for that item.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item**: Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, while still trying to respect the highest valuations.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items**: For items that have not yet been allocated, choose the agent with the next highest valuation who hasn't yet received an item.

Following this approach, here is a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1 (Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1)
- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 6 (Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3, 5 (Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3)
- **Agent 3**: Item 7 (Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 7)
- **Agent 4**: Item 2 (Agent 4 values item 2 highly)

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
