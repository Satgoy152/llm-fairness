Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  37   1  76  39  12  30  16
1  15  21  69  44  54  62  18  49
2  46   1  16  36  69  12  62  41
3  29  96  48   9   6  59  92  16
4   6  65  53  69  66  73  98  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [15 21 69 44 54 62 18 49]
 [46  1 16 36 69 12 62 41]
 [29 96 48  9  6 59 92 16]
 [ 6 65 53 69 66 73 98 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider distributing the items in a way that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, not every agent will receive an equal number of items, but we will aim for a fair distribution based on the valuations.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 0 (valuations 76 and 27)
- Agent 1: Items 5 and 2 (valuations 62 and 69)
- Agent 2: Items 4 and 6 (valuations 69 and 62)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (valuation 96)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (valuation 61)

This allocation attempts to maximize the value for each agent based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7]
}
```
