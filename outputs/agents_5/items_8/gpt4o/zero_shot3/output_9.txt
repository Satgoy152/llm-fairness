Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  73  29  10  45  23   5  32
1  34  36  81   2  13  73  19  74
2  71   5   6   6  24  20  24  90
3  17  26  28  56   1  85  54  41
4  65  79  39  94  66  26  35  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 7.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3.

Then we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 4, 6) fairly:

- Agent 0 gets item 1 (second highest valuation for agent 0).
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (second highest valuation for agent 1).
- Agent 4 gets item 6 (has a decent valuation and agent 4 has already a highly valuable item).

The allocation ensuring each agent receives at least one item and maximizing their preference could look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of item values among the agents while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
