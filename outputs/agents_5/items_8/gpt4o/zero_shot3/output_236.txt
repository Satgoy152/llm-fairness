Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  97  97  71  18  20  20  11
1  44   4  71  47  80   2   1  85
2  67  60  65   7  51  19  98  97
3  88  58  87  13  78  95  10  36
4  60  99  10  21  51  54  31  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can aim to give each agent at least one item, ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible based on their valuations. Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items highly at index 0, 1, and 2. We can allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 4 and item 7. We can allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values items 6 and 7. We can allocate item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values items 0, 2, and 5. We can allocate item 5 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 1 and item 7. We can allocate item 1 to agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to ensure all items are distributed:

- Item 2: Agent 3 highly values item 2, so allocate it to agent 3.
- Item 3: Agent 0 has a decent valuation for item 3, so allocate it to agent 0.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values item 7 highly, so allocate it to agent 2.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.
