Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  18  92  83   4  18  35  56
1   7  75  61  82  38  41  83  10
2  13  96   2   7  80  18  66   0
3  83  99  67  77  72  86  90  90
4  38  60  94  75  22   5  86  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated. One way to approach this is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Collect all the valuations for each item across all agents.
2. For each item, assign it to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0:
  - Agent 3 values it the most at 83.
- Item 1:
  - Agent 3 values it the most at 99.
- Item 2:
  - Agent 4 values it the most at 94.
- Item 3:
  - Agent 0 values it at 83, which is the highest for this item.
- Item 4:
  - Agent 2 values it the most at 80.
- Item 5:
  - Agent 3 values it the most at 86.
- Item 6:
  - Agent 3 values it the most at 90.
- Item 7:
  - Agent 3 values it the most at 90.

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item. Since Agent 3 has been allocated the majority of the items, we can redistribute some items to ensure all agents receive an allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 0, 5, 6, 7
- Agent 4: Item 2

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 5, 6, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, while trying to maximize each agent's total valuation from the items they receive.
