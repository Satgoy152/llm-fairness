Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  36  61   1  64   8  47  31
1  97  28   9  39  47  87  34  79
2   5  97  94  31  93  81  30  50
3  20  78  11  38  39  71  88  55
4   6  67  27  47  15  89  60  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to optimize for maximum total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here’s one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 highly, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 highly, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 highly, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 3 more items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and considering their valuations.

6. Agent 0 also has a relatively high value for item 2, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
7. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 7, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 1.
8. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

This ensures each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated. Here’s the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
