Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  42  13  65  21  43  38  99
1  94  26  72  97  52  69  72   5
2  74  94  70   5  13  33  91  61
3  44  11  35  38  50  20  24  69
4  91  98  50  43  88  40  77   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll prioritize maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Here's how we can approach this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Determine which items have the highest value for each agent and try to allocate those items to increase overall satisfaction.
2. **Balance Assignments**: Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, to ensure fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 is the most valued by Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Item 1 is the best option for Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 provides a balanced choice for Agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 7, let's add item 5, which is their next highest value.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 3, let's add item 6, which is their next preference.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 1, let's add item 2. 
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 4, let's add item 3 for balance.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 0, let's add item 6 for balance.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

Note: This allocation aims to maximize the total satisfaction based on the given valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
