Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  82  72  52  87  74  43  39
1  60  58  86  73  39  35  76  63
2  38  67  24  90  51  51  38  37
3  44  14   6  82  11  10  74  34
4  26  96  67  77  37  14  36  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value received by each agent. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total value. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (87), Item 1 (82)
   - Allocation: Item 4

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (86), Item 0 (60)
   - Allocation: Item 2

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (90), Item 1 (67)
   - Allocation: Item 3

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (82), Item 6 (74)
   - Allocation: Item 6

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (96), Item 7 (97)
   - Allocation: Item 1, Item 7

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 0 is still unallocated. The highest remaining valuation is by Agent 0 (76).
- Item 5 is still unallocated. The highest remaining valuation is by Agent 0 (74).

Let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to an agent, and the allocation aims to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.
