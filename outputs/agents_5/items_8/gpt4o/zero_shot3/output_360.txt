Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  33  29  22  86  85  10  68
1  25  24  87  29   1  33  10  82
2  32  71  41  25  16   6  35  86
3  84  99  13  25  37  67  41  72
4  89  10  54  89   5  15  72  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated. One approach is to maximize each agent's total valuation by considering their preferences, while ensuring fairness in distribution.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations are for items 4 (86), 0 (85), and 5 (85). 
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is for item 2 (87).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 7 (86).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 1 (99).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuation is for item 0 (89).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, allocate the remaining items 3, 5, and 6 based on the next highest valuations that haven't been assigned yet:

6. **Agent 3** (next highest valuations after item 1):
   - Item 5 (67) is the highest remaining.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

7. **Agent 0** (next highest valuations after item 4):
   - Item 6 (10) is the highest remaining.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

8. **Agent 4** (next highest valuations after item 0):
   - Item 3 (89) is the highest remaining.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed.
