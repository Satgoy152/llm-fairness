Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  93  27  65  32  72  91  74
1   0  27   8  92   8   8  68  97
2  91  78  57  78  34  21  25  47
3  95  95  12  95  22  74  83  20
4  21  73   3  49  82   4  90  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items they value highly while trying to balance the overall distribution. Here's one approach:

1. **Assign Highest Valued Items**: Start by assigning each agent their highest valued items, ensuring no overlaps.
2. **Balance the Distribution**: After initial assignment, distribute any remaining items to agents who have received fewer items, while still trying to allocate items they value.

Following this strategy, we can derive the allocations:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 1, 6, and 7.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the highest.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest.
- Agent 3 values items 0, 1, and 3 equally.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest.

Let's assign items:

- Give item 1 to Agent 0 (they value it highly at 93).
- Give item 7 to Agent 1 (they value it highly at 97).
- Give item 0 to Agent 2 (they value it highly at 91).
- Give item 3 to Agent 3 (they value it highly at 95).
- Give item 6 to Agent 4 (they value it highly at 90).

Now, allocate the remaining items (2, 4, and 5):

- Item 2: Assign to Agent 2 (second-highest value at 57).
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 4 (they value it at 82).
- Item 5: Assign to Agent 0 (they value it at 72).

Here is the finalized allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value while distributing all 8 items across the 5 agents.
