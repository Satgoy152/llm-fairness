Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  22  12  33  68  66  60  22
1  80  68  52  26  53  90  51  74
2   4  89  92  83  91  75  36  61
3  29  53   6  83  83  14  22  64
4  82   3  80  41  42  73  57  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent according to their preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Valuations: [21, 22, 12, 33, 68, 66, 60, 22]
   - Highest valuations: Items 4, 5
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations: [80, 68, 52, 26, 53, 90, 51, 74]
   - Highest valuations: Items 0, 5
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations: [4, 89, 92, 83, 91, 75, 36, 61]
   - Highest valuations: Items 2, 4
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Valuations: [29, 53, 6, 83, 83, 14, 22, 64]
   - Highest valuations: Items 3, 4
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Valuations: [82, 3, 80, 41, 42, 73, 57, 96]
   - Highest valuations: Items 0, 7
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 4

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 5, 6) to maximize the satisfaction:

- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 (highest valuation after Item 0)
- Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2 (second-highest valuation)
- Allocate Item 6 to Agent 4 (next highest valuation)

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7, 6]
}
```
