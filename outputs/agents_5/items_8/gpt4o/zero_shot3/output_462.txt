Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  77  18  11  15  70  88  65
1   6  44  68  24  18   4  61  24
2  38  17  44  74  40  14  59  71
3  65  83  76  87  11  23  89  34
4  62  79  20  78  36  35  12  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will attempt to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a method like the maximum weighted matching in a bipartite graph, but for simplicity, we'll aim for a reasonable allocation manually.

Let's start by examining the highest valuations for each agent to try to give each the items they value the most:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the most (88) and item 1 (77). 
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (68).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (74).
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most (89).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most (79).

We should avoid assigning the same item to more than one agent, and we should make sure every item is assigned to an agent.

Let's try to allocate items by selecting the highest-valued available item for each agent, and then filling in the remaining items based on leftover preferences:

1. Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (valued at 89).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (valued at 74).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (valued at 77).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (valued at 62).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 68).

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- Item 4 can go to Agent 2 (valued at 40).
- Item 5 can go to Agent 0 (valued at 70).
- Item 7 can go to Agent 4 (valued at 56).

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Items 3, 4
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 0, 7

This allocation uses each item exactly once and assigns each agent at least one item, where possible, aligning with their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```
