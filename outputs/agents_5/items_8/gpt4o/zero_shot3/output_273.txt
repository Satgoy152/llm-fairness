Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  37  28  28   8  46  44  99
1  65  45  40  68  24  73  89  12
2  56  75  75  91  65  72  24  84
3  72  51  80  58  61  70  84  79
4   8  50  34   2  57  18  29  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. This approach is a simplified version of the "maximum sum allocation" problem, which is common in fair division tasks.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (83), Item 7 (99)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (89), Item 5 (73)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 1 (75), Item 2 (75)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (80), Item 6 (84)
   - Since Item 6 is already allocated, allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (57), Item 1 (50)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 3 more items:

- Remaining items: 0, 1, 5
- Let's allocate based on the highest remaining valuations for these items:

6. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate Item 0 (83) since it has the highest valuation for it.
   
7. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate Item 5 (73) since it has the highest remaining valuation for it.

8. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate Item 1 (75) since it has the highest remaining valuation for it.

Now, all 8 items have been allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
