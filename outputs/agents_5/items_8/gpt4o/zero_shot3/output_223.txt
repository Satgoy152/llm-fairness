Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7   9  30   4  90  56  98  30
1  28  68  43  40  75   6  62   2
2  10  41  13  19  40  20  32  44
3  14  66   0  42  20  38  21  30
4  56   0  62  44  58  91  73  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

One heuristic that could be used is to iterate over agents, giving each agent their most valued available item until all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 the most (98), so it gets allocated to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (68), so it gets allocated to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 the most (44), so it gets allocated to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 3 (42), so it gets allocated to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the most (91), so it gets allocated to Agent 4.
6. Agent 0 can then receive item 4 (90), as it is the next highest available.
7. Agent 1 can then receive item 0 (28), as it is the next highest available.
8. Finally, Agent 2 can receive item 2 (13), as it is the next highest available.

Let's ensure all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has a fair distribution based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
