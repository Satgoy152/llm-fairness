Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  20  95  47  68  34  96  17
1  62  63  99  41  48  31  28  38
2  28  16  85  41  29  36  91  55
3  20  84   1  52  93   5  49  28
4  83  51  51   6  76  34  65  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations of the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and no agent should be left without any item unless necessary.

Here is one way to achieve a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 very highly (96), so it's beneficial to allocate item 6 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (99), so item 2 should be allocated to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5 (36), so we can allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly (93), therefore item 4 can be allocated to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 7 highly (91), so item 7 should be allocated to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can also take item 0 (82), which they value highly.
- Agent 3 can take item 1 (84), which they value well.
- Agent 4 can take item 3 (6), or alternatively, Agent 1 can take it, but we'll choose Agent 4 to balance the load.

This way, every agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed to maximize the value based on the agentsâ€™ preferences.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```
This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items they value highly.
