Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  43  88   5  37  80  81  80
1  44   6  58  32  90  50  17  67
2  18  62   2   4  55  26  10  85
3  12  68  90   9  39   1  64  35
4  85  73  56   4  72  71  76  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the valuations provided to maximize the satisfaction of each agent with their allocated items. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. First, identify the highest value an agent has for each item, and assign that item to the corresponding agent.
2. If an agent has already received an item, assign the highest available value to the next agent in line.

Following this approach:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 3, 5, and 7:

- Item 3 can be allocated to agent 1, who values it at 32.
- Item 5 can be allocated to agent 0, who values it at 80.
- Item 7 can be allocated to agent 2, who values it at 85.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
