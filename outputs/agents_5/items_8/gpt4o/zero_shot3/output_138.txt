Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  36  62  72  29  60  85  81
1  71  59  14  51  18  41  91  30
2  88  29  83  15  13  78  23  16
3  39  24  75  30  45   3  95  76
4  29  77  77  88  50  33  31   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We can use a simple greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Hereâ€™s how we can do it:

1. Start by assigning each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item by reassigning items if necessary.
3. Check if any agent has no items and adjust by redistributing from an agent with more than one item.

After processing, the allocation might look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

Here, each agent has received at least one item, and all items have been allocated. The allocation was made by considering the highest valuations and ensuring that each agent receives a fair share.
