Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  20  96  55  94   1  67  60
1  13  79  69  88  96  10  95  47
2   4  33  55   4  43  51  70  39
3  91  64  89  48  22  31  31  22
4   3  26  30   3  76   5  88   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 79 69 88 96 10 95 47]
 [ 4 33 55  4 43 51 70 39]

 [ 3 26 30  3 76  5 88  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach in fair division is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [81, 20, 96, 55, 94, 1, 67, 60]
Agent 1: [13, 79, 69, 88, 96, 10, 95, 47]
Agent 2: [4, 33, 55, 4, 43, 51, 70, 39]
Agent 3: [91, 64, 89, 48, 22, 31, 31, 22]
Agent 4: [3, 26, 30, 3, 76, 5, 88, 9]
```

### Allocation Strategy
- Allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item among agents, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
- Adjust allocations to ensure all items are assigned.

### Allocation Process
1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (91).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (79).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (96).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (88).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (96).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (51).
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (95).
8. **Item 7**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (60).

### Adjustments to Ensure Fair Distribution
- Rearrange allocations to ensure each agent gets at least one item.
- Agent 4, who currently has no items, receives an item with a relatively lesser impact on the total valuation.

### Final Allocations
```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1, 3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item, and the allocations are made considering the valuations provided.
