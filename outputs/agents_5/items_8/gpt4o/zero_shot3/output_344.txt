Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  10  45  88  63  52  76  54
1   7  59  96  46  53  22  53  78
2  60  93  26   2  78  77  33   1
3  31  81  39  69  20  44  66  64
4  94  58  82  86  57  40  22  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly while ensuring that all 8 items are allocated. Let's proceed with a strategy that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's highest-valued items.

Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 3 (88) and 6 (76). Assign item 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (96). Assign item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 1 (93) and 4 (78). Assign item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 1 (81), which is already allocated. Instead, assign item 5 (44), as it's one of the higher values left.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 0 (94) and 3 (86), but item 3 is already allocated. Assign item 0.

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated. We have so far allocated items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5, leaving items 4, 6, and 7 unallocated.

1. **Allocate item 4**: Assign to Agent 2 since they value it relatively high (78).
2. **Allocate item 6**: Assign to Agent 0 since they value it relatively high (76).
3. **Allocate item 7**: Assign to Agent 1 since they value it relatively high (78).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```
