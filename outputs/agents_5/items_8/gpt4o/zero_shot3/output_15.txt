Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  59  37  80  83  46  47  85
1  28  90  57  85  12  45  39  24
2  50  64  56  70  90  64  87  82
3  74  56  21   3  41  34  65  57
4  40  63  23  78  51  31  62  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy such as maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent. We might also consider ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible and that the allocations are balanced.

1. First, let's look at the highest valuations for each agent and see if we can assign items based on these preferences.
2. Then, distribute the remaining items to balance the allocation.

The goal is to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: We'll start by giving them item 7, as it has the highest valuation for agent 0.
- Agent 1: Assign item 1, which has the highest valuation for agent 1.
- Agent 2: Assign item 4, which has the highest valuation for agent 2.
- Agent 3: Assign item 0, which has a high valuation for agent 3.
- Agent 4: Assign item 3, which has the highest valuation for agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (2, 5, 6):
- Agent 0: Assign item 5, which is the next highest valuation.
- Agent 2: Assign item 6, which is a high valuation for agent 2.
- Agent 1: Assign item 2, which gives agent 1 a second item but fits within their value preference.

Ensure that each agent has at least one allocated item if possible, and a total of 8 items are assigned:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent is assigned items, with agent 0, 1, and 2 getting two items each, while agents 3 and 4 get one item each. The total number of items allocated is 8.
