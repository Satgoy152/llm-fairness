Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  83  81  96  43  47  76  71
1  70  83  75  48  94  50   4  51
2  53  10  35  85  41  67  27  78
3  48  61   6  18  93  68  89  85
4  41  77   4  73  55  51  49  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (since there are 5 agents and 8 items). 

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than necessary for a fair distribution.

2. Adjust allocations to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that no agent receives too many, while respecting the valuations as much as possible.

By following this approach, let's create a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 7.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 1 and 5.

Now, distribute the remaining items to agents who value them fairly and ensure each gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 7.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets items 1 and 5.
- Distribute remaining item 3 to Agent 0 and item 4 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the agents' preferences and ensures a fair distribution of items.
