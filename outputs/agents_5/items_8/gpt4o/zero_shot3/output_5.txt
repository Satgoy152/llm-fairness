Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  16  83  89  62  55  95  10
1  87  90  23  25  41  53  60  32
2  19  69  11  15  24  68   6  84
3  69  80  96  44  41  84  60  52
4  69  47  93  64  36   2  20  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets a share of the items that maximizes their total valuation. We'll consider a simple approach where we allocate items one by one to the agent that values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values this item the most (87), so we allocate it to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item the most (90), so we allocate it to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values this item the most (96), so we allocate it to Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values this item the most (89), so we allocate it to Agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values this item the most (62), so we allocate it to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values this item the most (84), so we allocate it to Agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values this item the most (95), so we allocate it to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values this item the most (84), so we allocate it to Agent 2.

After following this process, we have the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, each agent gets an integer number of items, and items are assigned to the agents who value them the most.
