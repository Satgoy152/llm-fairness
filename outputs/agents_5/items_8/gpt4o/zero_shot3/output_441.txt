Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  68  97  48  71  78   9  90
1  73  11  72  89  86  16  45  61
2  44   6  30  10  18  36  81  28
3  15  92  15  31  52  57  66  92
4  45  72  51  89  24  51  79  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[57 68 97 48 71 78  9 90]
 [73 11 72 89 86 16 45 61]
 [44  6 30 10 18 36 81 28]
 [15 92 15 31 52 57 66 92]
 [45 72 51 89 24 51 79 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Allocate items that they value highly, such as item 2 (value 97) and item 7 (value 90).
- Agent 1: Allocate items with high values for them, such as item 3 (value 89) and item 4 (value 86).
- Agent 2: Allocate item 6 (value 81), which is their highest valued item.
- Agent 3: Allocate item 1 (value 92) and item 7 (value 92), which are their highest valued items.
- Agent 4: Allocate item 0 (value 45) and item 5 (value 51), which are their highest valued items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least some items they highly value, while distributing the total of 8 items fairly across the agents.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```
