Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  77  31  74  63  41  18  48
1  82  98  59  95  82  32  15  41
2  61  41  67  29  39  33  16  46
3  14  36  82  53  15  44  71  74
4  76  90  85  53  39  49  82   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to assign the items in such a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given that there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive one item, while others may receive two items.

We will use a simple approach where we assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring no item is assigned more than once. After each agent has received one item, we will assign the remaining items to agents that have the next highest valuations for items not yet assigned.

Let's go through the allocations:

1. **Initial Allocation (one item per agent):**
   - **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (77).
   - **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (98) but it's already taken, so next highest is item 3 (95).
   - **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (67).
   - **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (82) but it's already taken, so next highest is item 7 (74).
   - **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (90) but it's already taken, so next highest is item 2 (85), but it's also taken. Next is item 0 (76).

2. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Items left: 4, 5, 6
   - Assign these to agents based on remaining high valuations.
   - **Agent 1**: Next highest valuation for remaining items is item 4 (82).
   - **Agent 4**: Next highest valuation for remaining items is item 5 (49).
   - **Agent 3**: Next highest valuation for remaining items is item 6 (71).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7, 6],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while trying to respect their preferences to the extent possible given the constraints.
