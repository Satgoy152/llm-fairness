Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  78   0  37  64  18  88  34
1   5  39  37  46  67  72  30  98
2  69  42  49  64  19  30   1  18
3  28  96  90  44  98  90  22  81
4  82   5  45  52  73  62  21  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 5 39 37 46 67 72 30 98]
 [69 42 49 64 19 30  1 18]

 [82  5 45 52 73 62 21 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 6 the highest (88), so they can be allocated item 6. Additionally, they value item 1 highly (78), so they can also get item 1.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 7 the highest (98), so they can be allocated item 7. They also value item 5 highly (72), so they can get item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 the highest (69), so they can be allocated item 0. They also have decent value for item 3 (64), so they can get item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 4 the highest (98), so they can be allocated item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 2 the highest (45), so they can be allocated item 2.

With this allocation, each agent is assigned items based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
