Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  40  72  68  63  98  99  63
1  82  63  46   8  36  22  93  45
2  90  35  94  65  13  65  98  20
3  11  87  41   4  53  42  40  49
4  10  66  87  35  40   8  17  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we want to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of high-valued items as much as possible. We will attempt to distribute the items such that the allocation is as balanced as possible in terms of total valuation for each agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 5, 6, and 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are for items 0, 1, and 6.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for items 0, 2, and 6.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuations are for items 1 and 4.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuations are for items 2 and 1.

Considering these high-value preferences, we attempt to distribute the items:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Items 2, 4
- Agent 3: Items 1
- Agent 4: Items 7

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, aiming for a fair distribution based on their valuations.
