Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  78  91  33  33  97  49  89
1  71  49  32  66  90  66  85  81
2  49  51   3  98  23  10  39  32
3  87  61   7  84  40  35  98  91
4  67  75  84  70   7  11  72  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a relatively fair share based on their valuations. This can be approached by considering both the total number of items each agent should receive and their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives items with higher valuations for this agent.
2. **Agent 1**: Receives items where this agent has relatively higher valuations.
3. **Agent 2**: Receives items where this agent has some higher than average valuations.
4. **Agent 3**: Receives items that provide some of the best values for this agent.
5. **Agent 4**: Receives items with higher valuations for this agent.

Let's allocate the items based on these observations:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 1 (high values for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6 (good values for agent 1)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (high value for agent 2)
- Agent 3: Items 5, 7 (high values for agent 3)
- Agent 4: Item 2 (high value for agent 4)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to consider the valuations each agent has for the items while ensuring that all 8 items are allocated. Each agent receives a portion of the items, with the distribution leaning towards their preferences as much as possible.
