Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  69  94  31  64  29  97  82
1   8  75  17  24  78  37  51   3
2  21  71   3  47  64  98   9  59
3  71  58   2   5  57  29   3  72
4  16  86  98   9  49  85  75   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[97 69 94 31 64 29 97 82]
 [ 8 75 17 24 78 37 51  3]
 [21 71  3 47 64 98  9 59]
 [71 58  2  5 57 29  3 72]
 [16 86 98  9 49 85 75  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. One way to achieve this is by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 6 (valuations 97 and 97).
- Agent 1: Assign item 4 (valuation 78).
- Agent 2: Assign items 5 and 7 (valuations 98 and 59).
- Agent 3: Assign item 3 (valuation 5).
- Agent 4: Assign items 1 and 2 (valuations 86 and 98).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```
