Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  69  48  37  31  87  61  17
1  95  68   5  61  11  72  37  70
2  57  32  45  17  57  11  93  40
3  50  57  97  42  84   0  97  85
4  56  95  39  22  39  53  90  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations of the items to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly. We also need to make sure that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated.

Let's consider a potential allocation method where each agent receives at least one item with the highest valuation possible for them. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 0 with a value of 96. Let's assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 0 with a value of 95, but since item 0 is already allocated, we look at the next highest available item, which is item 3 with a value of 61. Let's assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 the most at 93. Let's assign item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 2 and item 6 both at 97, but item 6 is already allocated, so let's assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4's highest valuation is for item 1 at 95. Let's assign item 1 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (4, 5, and 7).

- **Remaining items**: Let's allocate these items to balance the distribution further:

   - **Agent 0**: Assign item 5 (value 87 to agent 0), since agent 0 highly values item 5.
   - **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 (value 84 to agent 3), as agent 3 values item 4 highly.
   - **Agent 1**: Assign item 7 (value 70 to agent 1), as agent 1 values item 7 highly.

Now, let's compile the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, each agent receives an item, and the distribution is based on the highest valuations.
