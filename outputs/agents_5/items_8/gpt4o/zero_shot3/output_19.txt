Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  86  16   6  90  36  45  76
1  85  63  85  95  22  72  48  65
2  86  46   8  29  58  98  41  17
3  44  46  43  41  31  38   8  81
4  42  63  99  16  93   0  74  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation of items each agent receives while ensuring every item is assigned to one agent. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Adjust if necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Based on the table provided, let's determine the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 86 (highest)
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 86 (highest)
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it at 99 (highest)
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 95 (highest)
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 90 (highest)
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 98 (highest)
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it at 74 (highest)
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 65 (highest)

Based on this approach, let's adjust to ensure all agents have an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 3, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Items 2, 6

Now, let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```
