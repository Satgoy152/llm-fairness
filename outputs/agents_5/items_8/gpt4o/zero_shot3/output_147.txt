Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23   6  66  77  42  56  73   0
1  67  84   3  24  96  34  76  48
2  58  58  24  94  18  77  15  98
3  17  15  94  23  95  77  84  27
4  71  77  32  62  92  92  42  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives, taking into account their individual valuations for the items. Given the valuations in the table, I'll attempt to distribute the items so that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible.

Here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 has relatively high valuations on items 0 and 6.
- Agent 1 has high valuations on items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 has a very high valuation on item 7.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation on items 2 and 5.
- Agent 4 has high valuations on items 3.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [7]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 4: Item [3]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
