Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  31  97  94  73  21   8  97
1  20  88   4   8  53  71  60  31
2  87  74  83  43   9  74  53  25
3  72  64  11  84  37  97  25  48
4  63  60  17  10  99  37  41  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the values in such a way that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to the items they value the most. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each agent is allocated the item they value the most in descending order of values, ensuring that no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Let's perform the allocation step-by-step:

1. Look for the highest value in the table and allocate that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Remove the allocated item from further consideration.
3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Following this method:

1. Item 0, valued highest by agent 0 at 68, is allocated to agent 0.
2. Item 1, valued highest by agent 1 at 88, is allocated to agent 1.
3. Item 2, valued highest by agent 0 at 97, is already allocated, so skip.
4. Item 3, valued highest by agent 0 at 94, is allocated to agent 0.
5. Item 4, valued highest by agent 4 at 99, is allocated to agent 4.
6. Item 5, valued highest by agent 3 at 97, is allocated to agent 3.
7. Item 6, valued highest by agent 1 at 60, is allocated to agent 1.
8. Item 7, valued highest by agent 0 at 97, is allocated to agent 0.

After allocation, we have:

- Agent 0 has items 0, 3, and 7.
- Agent 1 has items 1 and 6.
- Agent 2 has no items.
- Agent 3 has item 5.
- Agent 4 has item 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```
