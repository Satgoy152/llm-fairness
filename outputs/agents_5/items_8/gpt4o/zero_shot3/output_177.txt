Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  29  14  17  23  23  34  49
1  49  81  53  48  12  30  64  33
2  85  70  22  38  94  17   0  17
3   6   1  44   8  90  92  36  38
4  13  16  54   5  53  33   4  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we can attempt to maximize the total value each agent obtains from the items they receive while ensuring all items are distributed. This method is often referred to as maximizing the social welfare.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest at 94.
2. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it the highest at 92.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest at 81.
4. Assign item 6 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it highly at 64.
5. Assign item 7 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it the highest at 80.
6. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest at 17.
7. Assign item 2 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it the highest at 54.
8. Assign item 0 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest at 85.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least some value.
