Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  95  40  91  86  31  54  73
1  92  86  42   5   1   7  76  28
2  31  89   3  30  71  78  57  19
3  38  30  49  44  57  66  77  36
4  44  37  69  37  96  84  88  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more than one item while others may receive just one. 

Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Identify the highest value each agent places on an item and initially allocate those items.
2. Distribute the remaining items to balance the number of items each agent receives and maximize their valuations.

Following this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (95), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (92), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (78), so assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most (77), so assign item 6 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (96), so assign item 4 to agent 4.

Now, we have 3 more items to allocate: items 2, 3, and 7. We try to distribute them while considering the remaining highest valuations:

- Agent 0 has room for item 3 (91).
- Agent 3 has room for item 7 (36).
- Agent 4 has room for item 2 (69).

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while attempting to maximize the total valuation each agent receives.
