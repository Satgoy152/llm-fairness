Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  24  17   2  53  46  53  93
1  29   0  70  40  36  69  52  98
2  50  85  10  71  38  64  51   7
3  66  53  14  28  10  26  14  33
4  91  24  75  67  48  21  38  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A fair allocation would aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item when possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 7 the most (value 93), so assign item 7 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 the most (value 98), but it's already taken. So, assign item 2 to Agent 1, which has the next highest value (value 70).
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the most (value 85), so assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (value 66), so assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the most (value 91), but it's already taken. So, assign item 2 to Agent 4, which has the next highest value (value 75).

After this initial allocation, the remaining items are 3, 4, 5, and 6. 

6. Agent 0 can pick item 6 (value 53).
7. Agent 1 can pick item 5 (value 69).
8. Agent 3 can pick item 3 (value 28).

Now, only item 4 is left. Since Agent 4 has only one item so far, assign item 4 to Agent 4 to balance the distribution.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
