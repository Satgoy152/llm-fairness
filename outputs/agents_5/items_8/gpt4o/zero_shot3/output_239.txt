Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  98  42   0  92  19   9  67
1  28  43  28  33  32  76  47  70
2  95  60  14  57  67  83  45  42
3  48  66  52  97  29  68   8  59
4  82  11  37  99   0  92  78  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their individual valuations. With five agents and eight items, some agents will receive fewer items than others. Given the valuations provided, let's allocate the items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 1 and item 4, so let's allocate those items to them.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 the most, so we'll allocate item 5 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent places high value on item 0, so we'll allocate item 0 to them.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 3, so we'll allocate item 3 to them.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent places high value on item 7 and item 6, so we'll allocate items 7 and 6 to them.

Now, let's check if all items are allocated:
- Items 0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are allocated, leaving item 2.

For item 2:
- Agent 0 values item 2 at 42, which is the highest valuation among agents who have fewer items.
  
Thus, we can allocate item 2 to Agent 0 to balance the allocation.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.
