Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  24  27  78  77  37  26  74
1  29  61  79  29  90  67  65  65
2  63  92  24  69  71  41  90  22
3  64  43  45  92  24  50  31  73
4  42  39  42  11  76  49  26   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are assigned. One approach is to prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no overlap, and then assigning any remaining items based on the highest remaining values.

Let's proceed step by step:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Assign each agent the item they value the most, provided it hasn't been assigned yet.

   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (85).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the most (90).
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the most (92).
   - Agent 3 values item 3 the most (92).
   - Agent 4 values item 4 the most, but it's already taken, so assign next highest, item 5 (49).

2. **Assign Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items based on the next highest available values.

   - Remaining items: 2, 4, 6, 7
   - Agent 0 gets item 7 (74).
   - Agent 1 gets item 6 (65).
   - Agent 2 gets item 4 (71).
   - Agent 3 gets item 2 (45).
   - Agent 4 has already received an item.

After ensuring each agent gets at least one item and using remaining value preferences, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [5]
}
```
