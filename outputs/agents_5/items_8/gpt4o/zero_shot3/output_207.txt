Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  42  32  63  74  43  21  57
1  73  97  59  54  27  39  38  61
2  93  62  55  73  64  84  44  58
3  38  86  13  20  10  58  78  72
4  18  20  94  30  12  74  55  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 42 32 63 74 43 21 57]
 [73 97 59 54 27 39 38 61]
 [93 62 55 73 64 84 44 58]

 [18 20 94 30 12 74 55 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, given there are 5 agents and 8 items. We'll try to consider both the values agents assign to items and the necessity to distribute all items.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (Value of 85)
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2 (Values of 97 and 59)
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 5 (Values of 73 and 84)
- Agent 3: Items 7 (Value of 72)
- Agent 4: Items 4 and 6 (Values of 12 and 55)

This allocation considers both the values of the items for each agent and attempts to balance the allocation fairly. Now let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
