Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  66  71  13   2  68   1  64
1  81  14  33   5  61  15  56  24
2  93  15  17  44  33  32  14  60
3  42  15  32   9  72  72  75  95
4   3  72  10  52  49  75  41  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a manner that balances the total value each agent receives. We'll aim for an allocation where the total value perceived by each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0** values items highly at: 81, 66, 71, 68, 64.
2. **Agent 1** values items highly at: 81, 61, 56.
3. **Agent 2** values items highly at: 93, 44, 60.
4. **Agent 3** values items highly at: 72, 72, 75, 95.
5. **Agent 4** values items highly at: 72, 75.

Considering these high-value preferences, we can try to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences:

- Agent 0: Items 0 (81) and 2 (71) - Total value = 152
- Agent 1: Items 1 (14), 4 (61), and 6 (56) - Total value = 131
- Agent 2: Item 3 (44) - Total value = 44
- Agent 3: Items 5 (72) and 7 (95) - Total value = 167
- Agent 4: No items allocated

Now, let's check the total number of items allocated:

- Total items allocated: 2 (Agent 0) + 3 (Agent 1) + 1 (Agent 2) + 2 (Agent 3) = 8 items, which matches the required total.

Finally, here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": []
}
```
