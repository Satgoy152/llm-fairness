Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  66  59  33  39  11  69  95
1  49  29  31  31  45  67  10  28
2  96   3  12  26  78  95  85  98
3  85  49   0  91  66  69   2  13
4  97  87  79  85  30  74  15  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can follow a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring an equitable distribution among all agents. Given that there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others, but we'll try to ensure that all agents receive items with relatively high valuations for them. 

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation for each agent and assigning that item to them if it's not already taken.
2. Continue assigning remaining items to agents based on the next highest valuations available per agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust as necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Based on the table provided, hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 (80) and 7 (95).
- Agent 1 has moderate valuations, with the highest being item 5 (67) and item 4 (45).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 (96), 5 (95), and 7 (98).
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3 (91).
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 0 (97), 1 (87), and 3 (85).

Based on these considerations, here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (97 is the highest single valuation for this item).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (95 is the highest for Agent 2, and item 5 is a high priority).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (95 is very high for Agent 0 and not a priority for others).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (91 is the highest valuation for this item).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (87 is high for Agent 4).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (59 is a decent valuation and not highly contested).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (45 is the best remaining for Agent 1).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (85 is high for Agent 2).

Now, let's format this allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items with high values according to their preferences.
