Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16   1  84  99  12  96  27  74
1  11  85  11  96  93  55  56  73
2  99  56  10  17  65   7   2  58
3  67  19  71  29  33  82   0  20
4  75  61   3  86  94  65  88  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to give each agent the items that they value the most while ensuring all items are allocated.

First, let's identify the highest-valued item for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (value 99)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (value 85)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (value 99)
- Agent 3: Item 5 (value 82)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (value 94)

Now, let's allocate these items to their respective agents:

- Agent 0 gets Item 3
- Agent 1 gets Item 1
- Agent 2 gets Item 0
- Agent 3 gets Item 5
- Agent 4 gets Item 4

There are 3 items left to allocate: Items 2, 6, and 7. Let's allocate them based on the remaining highest values:

- Item 2 has the highest remaining value for Agent 0 (value 84)
- Item 6 has the highest remaining value for Agent 4 (value 88)
- Item 7 has the highest remaining value for Agent 4 (value 79)

Now, let's allocate these items:

- Agent 0 gets Item 2
- Agent 4 gets Items 6 and 7

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives items.
