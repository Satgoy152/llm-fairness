Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  79  50  70  52  61  32  20
1   8  20  62   0   3  81   7  55
2  86   2  51  15  89  89   9  92
3  94  75  15  82  92  76  86  88
4  11  73  30  56  49  49  48  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Here's one way to allocate the items fairly based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1 the most compared to the other agents, so we'll start by assigning item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the highest, so we'll assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest, so we'll assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 0, so we'll assign item 0 to Agent 3.

5. For **Agent 4**, we can assign item 7, as it is the highest remaining value for this agent.

6. Now, for the remaining items, we continue to allocate based on the highest remaining values:

   - **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 (next highest available for Agent 2).
   - **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 (next highest available for Agent 3).
   - **Agent 4**: Assign item 2 (next highest available for Agent 4).

Let's ensure that each agent is included in the JSON format, even if they received no items. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are fairly distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item based on their highest valuations.
