Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  88   2  67  74  51  34  79
1  52  27  21  24  61  61  42  16
2   2  47  70  29  38  39  93  35
3  84  33  75  64  38  68  40  93
4   1  27  75  52  60  36  82  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's one potential way to allocate the items:

1. Start by analyzing the highest valuations for each item across all agents and try to assign the item to the agent that values it the most. This initial allocation process helps ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly.

2. After the initial allocation, check if any agents have no items. If so, consider redistributing some items to ensure all agents receive at least one item.

3. Ensure all items from 0 to 7 are allocated, and no agent receives more than three items to maintain fairness.

Based on the valuations table, here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 (88) and item 0 (66) highly.
- **Agent 1** values item 4 (61) and item 5 (61) highly.
- **Agent 2** values item 6 (93) highly.
- **Agent 3** values item 7 (93) and item 3 (64) highly.
- **Agent 4** values item 2 (75) highly.

Following these observations, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [6]
- Agent 3: Items [7, 3]
- Agent 4: Items [2]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while all items are distributed. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
