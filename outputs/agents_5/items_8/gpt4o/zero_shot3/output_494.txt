Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49   3  79  21  30  19   3  87
1  91  19  20  77   0  72  99  48
2  32  60  94  69  29  58  41  58
3  57  95  87  89  24  45  31  86
4  38  95  66  34  57  15  62  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives from their assigned items, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Here's one approach for a fair allocation:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents such that the total value is maximized for each agent, while ensuring no item is allocated more than once and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the table and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 7 highly (87) and item 2 highly (79).
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly (91) and item 6 highly (99).
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly (94).
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly (95).
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly (95).

Now, let's allocate items ensuring each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items while covering all items:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [0, 6]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1, 4, 5]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a reasonable allocation based on their highest preferences.
