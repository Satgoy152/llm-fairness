Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  49  20  68  22  27  54  30
1   0  85  35  34  55  45  93  94
2  16  32  24  16  16  26  68  72
3  14  70   4  58  25  65  36  25
4  50  81  76  53  76  23  25  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring every agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has a high value for item 0 (87). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 7 (94) and item 6 (93) the most. Assign items 6 and 7 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 (72) next highest after Agent 1. However, item 7 is already assigned. Assign item 5 (26) to Agent 2, which is their highest remaining value.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 (70) the most after Agent 1 has taken their highest preference. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 (81) highest, but it's already assigned. Their next highest preference is item 2 (76). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now let's look at the remaining items. Items 3 and 4 are left unassigned.

6. Agent 0 has the highest remaining valuation for item 3 (68) among unassigned items. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
7. Agent 4 has the highest remaining valuation for item 4 (76). Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value relatively high while distributing all items fairly. Here is the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
