Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  15   9  93  44  51   3   5
1  35  42  50  53  83  23  74  52
2  52  83  25  47  94  66  34  37
3  56  66  14   5  59  87  57  53
4   6  76  85  58  65  55  14  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a manner that balances fairness and efficiency. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Values item 3 highly (93). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. Agent 1:
   - Values item 4 highly (83). Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

3. Agent 2:
   - Values item 1 highly (83). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. Agent 3:
   - Values item 5 highly (87). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. Agent 4:
   - Values item 2 highly (85). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 3 more items. 

6. Agent 0:
   - Let's also allocate item 0 (56) to Agent 0, as it has a reasonably high value.

7. Agent 3:
   - Let's allocate item 7 (53) to Agent 3, as it has a reasonably high value.

8. Agent 4:
   - Let's allocate item 6 (14) to Agent 4, as it would be fair for Agent 4 to have another item.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable number of items based on their valuations. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```
