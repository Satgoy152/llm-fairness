Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  44  38  51  50  88  26  72
1  15   6  52  77  57  73  51  80
2  21  80  52  28  67  98  63  65
3  53   6   4  14  36  37  80  12
4  94  55  96  16  44  40  81  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We'll try to distribute the items such that agents get the items that they value the most.

Let's analyze the situation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (98).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (77).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (98).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6 (80).
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 2 (96).

Now, let's allocate the rest of the items:

- Item 1: Agent 2 values it highly (80), so allocate to agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it highly (67), so allocate to agent 2.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it highly (80), so allocate to agent 1.

Now, let's summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: 0
- Agent 1: 3, 7
- Agent 2: 1, 4, 5
- Agent 3: 6
- Agent 4: 2

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1, 4, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```
