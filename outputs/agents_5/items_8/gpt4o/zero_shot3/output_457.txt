Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  33  20  90  37  40  16  87
1  95  62  26  30  70  82  34  11
2  97  47  61  44  75  22  71  90
3  36  54  38  42  56  24  62  74
4  33  34   6   0  76  57  82  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [95 62 26 30 70 82 34 11]

 [33 34  6  0 76 57 82 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution considers the agents' valuations. Here's a potential fair allocation:

- Agent 0 has high value for item 3 and moderate values for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 1 has high value for item 0.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 0, 4, and 7.
- Agent 3 has moderate values for items 1, 6, and 7.
- Agent 4 has high values for items 4 and 6.

Based on these observations, a fair allocation could be as follows:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
7. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
8. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Now, we will present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6, 4]
}
```
