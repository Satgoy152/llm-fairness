Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  35  52  47  65  62  80  10
1  36  13  53  10  94  10  85  87
2  44  25  80  79  80  67  17  90
3  29  25  68  57  22  86  16  42
4  41  14  34  42  76  15  57  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [41 14 34 42 76 15 57 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives, ensuring that all items are allocated and no agent is left without considering their valuations. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items of highest value: 6 (80), 4 (65), 5 (62)
   - Allocating: [6, 5]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items of highest value: 4 (94), 6 (85), 7 (87)
   - Allocating: [4]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items of highest value: 2 (80), 3 (79), 7 (90)
   - Allocating: [2, 7]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items of highest value: 5 (86), 2 (68), 3 (57)
   - Allocating: [5, 3]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items of highest value: 7 (95), 4 (76)
   - Allocating: [0, 1]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent receives items in accordance with their valuations.
