Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  85  74  18  42  16  59  90
1  78  94  41  75  43  24  33  77
2  95  25  10  95  63  48  39  27
3  93  93  97  50  14  64  53  14
4  80   5  46  99   4  16  33   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. This kind of problem can often be approached with a greedy method, assigning items based on the highest valuations first, or using optimization techniques to balance the allocations.

Let's try to allocate the items based on the highest individual valuations first:

1. Start with the highest valuations for each item and assign them to the respective agents.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that no item is left unallocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Item 0 is valued the highest by Agent 2.
- Item 1 is valued the highest by Agent 1.
- Item 2 is valued the highest by Agent 3.
- Item 3 is valued the highest by Agent 4.
- Item 4 is valued the highest by Agent 2.
- Item 5 is valued the highest by Agent 3.
- Item 6 is valued the highest by Agent 0.
- Item 7 is valued the highest by Agent 0.

Let's review the allocations to ensure fairness and make adjustments if necessary.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item while maximizing their satisfaction based on valuations. Note that Agent 1, despite having only one item, receives the item they value the most, and all items are allocated.
