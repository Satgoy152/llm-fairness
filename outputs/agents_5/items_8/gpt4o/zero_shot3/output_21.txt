Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  67  66  96   6  64  46  74
1  48  55  17  68  38  16  84  59
2  81  41  75  62  41  50  60  38
3  33  10  56  38  20  69  61  38
4  86   1  25  37  87  50  42  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that every item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that maximizes fairness by considering each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 3 (96), 0 (79)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 6 (84), 3 (68)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 0 (81), 2 (75)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value items: 5 (69), 6 (61)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest value items: 0 (86), 4 (87)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, allocate the remaining items considering each agent's remaining high-value items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (second choice was also 79).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (second choice was 55).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 4 (third choice was 64).

Checking if each agent is assigned at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8:

- Agent 0: 0, 3
- Agent 1: 1, 6
- Agent 2: 2
- Agent 3: 5
- Agent 4: 4, 7

This allocation is fair and complete.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
