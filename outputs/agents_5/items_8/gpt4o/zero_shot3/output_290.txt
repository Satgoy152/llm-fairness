Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  47  19   9  71  24  87   0
1  61   6  56   5  74  80  12  98
2  30  37  25  90  14  31  79  70
3  43  14  97  15  42  45   9  68
4  79  14  45  12  61  35  52  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider both the values agents place on the items and the need to distribute the items evenly. Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. To balance this, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by assigning items where they have the highest valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 85).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value 47).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value 97).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 90).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 74).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 80).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 87).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1 (value 98).

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation, agents 0 and 1 receive three items each, while agents 2 and 3 receive one item each, and agent 4 receives no items. This distribution maximizes the satisfaction based on item valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
