Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  59  37  72  11  33  99  68
1  32  52  42  55  65  56  30  91
2  34  47  49  24  72  59  60  19
3  65   6  40  68  96  18  75  64
4  89  65  46  46  41  48  74  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the total value of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here's one approach to achieve that:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 6 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 7 (91).
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 4 (72).
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 4 (96) but will take item 3 (68) as item 4 is better allocated to agent 2.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values item 0 (89).

Now to balance other allocations, we'll assign the remaining items based on their next highest values:

- **Agent 0**: Can take item 1 (59) after item 6.
- **Agent 1**: Can take item 4 (65) after item 7.
- **Agent 2**: Can take item 5 (59) after item 4.
- **Agent 3**: Can take item 5 (59) after item 3, but item 5 is better suited for agent 2, so consider item 2 (40).
- **Agent 4**: Can take item 2 (46) after item 0.

Given these allocations, each agent should have items they value, and the total distribution is fair.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This ensures all 8 items are allocated, and each agent gets items they value highly.
