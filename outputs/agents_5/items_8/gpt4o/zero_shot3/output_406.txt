Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  69  15  76  93   1  33  16
1  87  99  85  31  91  26  37  76
2  77  85  58  92  44   5  64  65
3  95  51  33  50  43  43  14  93
4  25  43  74  45  94   0   2  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the valuations, the goal is to assign items to agents such that each agent is satisfied based on their preferences. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 1 (99) compared to others.
2. **Agent 3** values item 0 the most (95).
3. **Agent 0** is assigned item 4 since they value it the highest (93).
4. **Agent 2** is given item 3, which they value highly (92).
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 the most, but it's already taken. Instead, item 2 is second best for them (74).
6. **Agent 3** also values item 7 highly (93), so they get item 7.
7. **Agent 1** can take item 5, which they value more than other remaining options (26).
8. **Agent 2** is assigned item 6, which they value decently (64).

Now we have made sure each item is allocated and each agent has an integer number of items. 

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```
