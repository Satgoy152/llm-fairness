Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  48  65  85  20  90   2  84
1  57  49   8  68  19  71  41  18
2   2  64  29  15  39  63   1  84
3  38  16  58  72  55  70  76   9
4  77  31  37  47  36  54  57  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents such that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation for each item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest (71).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest (64).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest (65).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest (85).
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the highest (55).
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the highest (90).
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the highest (76).
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the highest (84).

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item by redistributing some items, if necessary:

- Agent 0 has items [0, 2, 3, 5, 7]
- Agent 1 has no items
- Agent 2 has item [1]
- Agent 3 has items [4, 6]
- Agent 4 has no items

To ensure fairness and that each agent receives at least one item, we can adjust the allocation slightly:

- Move item 7 from agent 0 to agent 4.
- Move item 3 from agent 0 to agent 1.

Now the allocation is:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [4, 6]
- Agent 4: [7]

Let's present the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
