Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61  82  28  44  84  19  28  66
1  87  76  48  22  64  89  38  78
2  14   9  35  61  13  38  21  15
3  96  83  79  80  36  28  86  28
4  76  42  15  56  61  10  46  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction (or total valuation) across all agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A reasonable way to approach this is to iteratively allocate the item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the provided table:

1. **Item 0**: Allocate to Agent 3 (value 96, highest).
2. **Item 1**: Allocate to Agent 0 (value 82, highest).
3. **Item 2**: Allocate to Agent 3 (value 79, highest).
4. **Item 3**: Allocate to Agent 3 (value 80, highest).
5. **Item 4**: Allocate to Agent 0 (value 84, highest).
6. **Item 5**: Allocate to Agent 1 (value 89, highest).
7. **Item 6**: Allocate to Agent 3 (value 86, highest).
8. **Item 7**: Allocate to Agent 1 (value 78, second highest after Agent 0 who already has two items).

Now we check how many items each agent has and adjust if necessary to ensure fairness and integer allocation. Agent 3 has 4 items, which might be too many compared to others. We can consider redistributing one item:

- Redistribute Item 2 from Agent 3 to Agent 4, as Agent 4 has no items yet and Agent 3 has the second-highest value for Item 2.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 3, 6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with Agent 2 being the only one not receiving any due to their consistently low valuations across all items. The allocation respects the constraint of distributing exactly 8 items.
