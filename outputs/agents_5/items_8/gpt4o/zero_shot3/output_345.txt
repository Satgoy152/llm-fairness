Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  11  64  32  60  87  98  66
1  13  34  32  47  84  13  18  61
2  54  98  99  11   7  46  87  88
3  41  71  49  10  76  42  88  20
4   6  20  43  15  80  29  12  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 11 64 32 60 87 98 66]
 [13 34 32 47 84 13 18 61]
 [54 98 99 11  7 46 87 88]
 [41 71 49 10 76 42 88 20]
 [ 6 20 43 15 80 29 12 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 8 items are allocated in total. We can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix and allocate items based on maximizing each agent's valuation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 6, 5, and 4.
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 4, 3, and 7.
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 2, 1, and 7.
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 6, 1, and 4.
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 4, 7, and 2.

We need to find an allocation that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated.

Considering each agent's highest valuations, let's allocate the items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items [5, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Items [3, 7]
- **Agent 2**: Items [1, 2]
- **Agent 3**: Item [0]
- **Agent 4**: Item [4]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 8 items are fairly distributed. Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
