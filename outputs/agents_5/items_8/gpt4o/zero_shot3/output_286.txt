Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  94   8  54  67  39  17  51
1  12  27  12  43  81  26  21  38
2  83   3  78  99  12  87  59  69
3   2  50  21  72  34  46  78   7
4  31   5  80  14  69  68  86  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (94), so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (81), so we allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (99), so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (78), so we allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the highest (87), so we allocate item 7 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate 3 more. We can allocate the remaining items based on the highest valuations from the remaining items.

6. Agent 2 values item 0 the second highest (83), so we allocate item 0 to agent 2.
7. Agent 4 values item 2 the second highest (80), so we allocate item 2 to agent 4.
8. Agent 4 also values item 5 the third highest (68), so we allocate item 5 to agent 4.

Now, all 8 items have been allocated. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
