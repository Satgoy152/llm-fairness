Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28  75  33  67  40  77  46  66
1  71   7  15   2  42  89  70  40
2  88  93  40  94  82  76   2  12
3  53  50  76  74   0  74  22  67
4  78  29  13   1  52  88  19  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's try to distribute the items in a way that gives each agent a relatively balanced share of the total value. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent to get a sense of their preferences.
2. Distribute the items by attempting to optimize the allocation so that each agent gets a fair share.

Here's a possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 7, which they value relatively highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 5, which has the highest value for them compared to other items.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3, which are among the highest values for them.
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 6, which they value reasonably well.
- Agent 4 receives item 4, which fits well based on their preferences and the remaining items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a portion of the items and attempts to balance the total value received by each agent.
