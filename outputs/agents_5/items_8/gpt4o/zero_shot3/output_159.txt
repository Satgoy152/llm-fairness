Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  40  12  54   4  91  58  26
1  27  53  90  36  36  84  21  47
2  65  55  91  69  39  38  27  89
3  88  44  26  66  73  54  78  37
4   3  97  73  25  38  69  88  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a relatively balanced share according to their valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Give item 5 (value 91) to agent 0 because it has the highest value for this agent.
   - Give item 3 (value 54) to agent 0 as it's the next highest value for this agent.

2. Agent 1:
   - Give item 2 (value 90) to agent 1 because it's the highest value for this agent.
   - Give item 1 (value 53) to agent 1 because it's the next highest value.

3. Agent 2:
   - Give item 7 (value 89) to agent 2 because it's the highest value for this agent.
   - Give item 0 (value 65) to agent 2 as it's another high value for this agent.

4. Agent 3:
   - Give item 4 (value 73) to agent 3 because it's the highest value for this agent.

5. Agent 4:
   - Give item 6 (value 88) to agent 4 because it has a high value for this agent.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [7, 0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and all 8 items are distributed.
