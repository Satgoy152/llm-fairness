Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  62  55  73  96  91  54  63
1  48  42  47  47  26  60  27   0
2  97  63  51  30  43  56  24   3
3  79  44   7  66  94  58   7  70
4   8  75  62   4  99  29  89  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the values each agent assigns to the items and aim for a distribution that maximizes overall satisfaction. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4. To maximize their satisfaction, we can assign them some of these high-value items.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has relatively low valuations compared to others, but item 2 has a moderate value. We can try to give them an item they value reasonably well.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest, but since it's already prioritized for Agent 0, we can look at other items they value reasonably, like 5.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0 and 4, but since these are prioritized for other agents, we can look at item 7, which they value significantly.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 has high valuations for items 4 and 7. Since these are partially prioritized for others, we can assign them item 6, which they also value quite well.

Considering these observations, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [2]
- Agent 2: Items [5]
- Agent 3: Items [7]
- Agent 4: Items [1, 3, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair distribution of items based on their valuations while ensuring all 8 items are allocated.

The JSON allocation would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 3, 6]
}
```
