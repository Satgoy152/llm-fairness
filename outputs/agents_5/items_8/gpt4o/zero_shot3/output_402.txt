Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  90  38   3  68   3  26  21
1  13  35  92  36  20   9  98   9
2  94  44  75  74  91  69  12  43
3  49  37  37  59  73  65  68  89
4  50  62   6  24  83  34  73  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [13 35 92 36 20  9 98  9]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value of all items. One approach is to use the concept of maximizing the overall valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and minimizing the envy. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Attempt to allocate items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their total valuation.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values: [13, 90, 38, 3, 68, 3, 26, 21] -> Total: 262
- Agent 1 values: [13, 35, 92, 36, 20, 9, 98, 9] -> Total: 312
- Agent 2 values: [94, 44, 75, 74, 91, 69, 12, 43] -> Total: 502
- Agent 3 values: [49, 37, 37, 59, 73, 65, 68, 89] -> Total: 477
- Agent 4 values: [50, 62, 6, 24, 83, 34, 73, 16] -> Total: 348

Let's allocate items to maximize value based on the above totals:

- Agent 0: [1] (90)
- Agent 1: [2, 6] (92, 98)
- Agent 2: [0, 4] (94, 91)
- Agent 3: [7] (89)
- Agent 4: [3, 5] (24, 34)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and it attempts to distribute the items fairly based on their valuations.

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```
