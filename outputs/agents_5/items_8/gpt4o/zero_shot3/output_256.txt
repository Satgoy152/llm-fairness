Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  86  69  94  87  27  98  23
1  90  40  49   4  41  62   6  59
2  12  75  79  40  60  23  57  49
3  81   3  25  93  78  50  50  23
4  55   0  16  93  99  21  75  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation of items assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and that all 8 items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item.
3. Allocate remaining items to the agents who value them the most.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valued item for agent 0 is item 6 with a value of 98.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valued item for agent 1 is item 0 with a value of 90.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valued item for agent 2 is item 2 with a value of 79.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valued item for agent 3 is item 3 with a value of 93.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valued item for agent 4 is item 4 with a value of 99.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and we have allocated 5 items so far. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items: 1, 5, and 7.

6. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 2 values item 1 the highest with a value of 75.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 2.

7. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest with a value of 62.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 4 values item 7 the highest with a value of 96.
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 4.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is made considering the highest valuations.
