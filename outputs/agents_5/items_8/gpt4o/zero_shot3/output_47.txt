Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  23  75   8  43  61  78  51
1  57  95  70  61  15  55  67   1
2   6  89  44  76  17  25  30  25
3  46  23  35   6  52  50  16  16
4  67  39  76  51  76  96  97  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes the total valuations for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as it has the highest valuation (95).
2. Assign item 6 to agent 4, since it has the highest valuation among unallocated items for agent 4 (97).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as it has the highest valuation for agent 0 (81).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as it has a high valuation (76).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as it has the highest valuation for agent 3 among remaining items (50).
6. Assign item 2 to agent 0, because it has a high valuation for agent 0 among remaining items (75).
7. Assign item 4 to agent 4, as it has a high valuation for agent 4 among remaining items (76).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 2, as it has a reasonable valuation (25) and is the highest among remaining options for agent 2.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets assigned at least one item and that the total allocations add up to 8 items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
