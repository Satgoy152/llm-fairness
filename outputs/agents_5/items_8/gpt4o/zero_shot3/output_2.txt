Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  54  59  51  39  56  63  56
1  33   4  95  99  31  21  17  49
2  95  34  80  25  16  62  83  83
3  24  35  14  86  40  40  88  87
4   5  55  53  50  86  38  78  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent is allocated an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 54.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 95.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most at 86.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 62.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most at 88.
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most at 87.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 2, 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: Items 6, 7
- Agent 4: Item 4

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```
