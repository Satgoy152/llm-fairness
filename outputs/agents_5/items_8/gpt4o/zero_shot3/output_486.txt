Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  39  90  47   5  99  19  27
1  82  82  66  59  74   6  88  94
2   9  92  38  24  84  93  55  30
3  52  94  56  60  60  26  35  82
4  49  61  83  28  60  12  44  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuation, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's take a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items**:
   - Agent 0: 35 + 39 + 90 + 47 + 5 + 99 + 19 + 27 = 361
   - Agent 1: 82 + 82 + 66 + 59 + 74 + 6 + 88 + 94 = 551
   - Agent 2: 9 + 92 + 38 + 24 + 84 + 93 + 55 + 30 = 425
   - Agent 3: 52 + 94 + 56 + 60 + 60 + 26 + 35 + 82 = 465
   - Agent 4: 49 + 61 + 83 + 28 + 60 + 12 + 44 + 63 = 400

2. **Allocate items to maximize individual satisfaction**:
   - Prioritize agents by their highest individual item valuations.
   - Ensure no agent receives more than two items as there are 8 items and 5 agents.

3. **Allocate items**:
   - Agent 0 values item 5 the most (99), allocate item 5.
   - Agent 1 values item 7 the most (94), allocate item 7.
   - Agent 2 values item 5 the second-highest (93), but it's already taken. Allocate item 1 (92).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (94), but it's already taken. Allocate item 3 (60).
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the most (83), allocate item 2.

4. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 was desired but is taken, allocate item 3 (47).
   - Agent 2: Item 4 is the next highest available (84), allocate item 4.
   - Agent 4: Only item 0 remains, allocate item 0.

5. **Final allocation**:
```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item (except Agent 3 due to their lower overall valuations compared to others), and all items are allocated.
