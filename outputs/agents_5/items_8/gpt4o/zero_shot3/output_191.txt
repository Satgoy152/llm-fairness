Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  29  68  71  98  99  93  39
1   1   8  52  15  17  27  22  95
2  17  98  18   5  84   9  18  94
3  88  19  43   3  70  75  54  82
4  39  43   8  24  29  30  72  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that have high value for agent 0. These are items 3 (71) and 5 (99).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that have high value for agent 1. These are items 2 (52) and 7 (95).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that have high value for agent 2. These are items 1 (98) and 4 (84).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that have high value for agent 3. These are items 0 (88) and 6 (54).
5. **Agent 4**: Since all items have been distributed, agent 4 will have no items in this allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their individual preferences and ensures that all 8 items are allocated.
