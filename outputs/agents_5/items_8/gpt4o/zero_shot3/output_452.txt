Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  49  65  72  63  49  71  24
1  57  68  28  77   7  34  33  14
2  88  59   5  75  78  65  83  53
3  39  15  39  43  21  14  96  30
4  64   9  23  55  76  72  92  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where items are allocated based on the highest valuation of each item among the agents, one by one. Below is a possible allocation:

1. Sort the items by their highest valuation and allocate them to the respective agents:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 with value 90
   - Item 3: Agent 1 with value 77
   - Item 6: Agent 3 with value 96
   - Item 4: Agent 2 with value 78
   - Item 5: Agent 2 with value 65
   - Item 7: Agent 4 with value 85
   - Item 1: Agent 1 with value 68
   - Item 2: Agent 0 with value 65

2. Ensure all items are allocated, and make adjustments if necessary to balance the number of items per agent. Based on the above allocations, the agents receive the following items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item while maximizing the total valuations.
