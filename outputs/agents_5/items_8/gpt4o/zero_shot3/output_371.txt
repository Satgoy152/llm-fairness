Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  44   7  20  27  22  69  89
1  63  32  58  83   9  43  13  58
2  72  96  36  28  11  98  73  47
3  93  73  86  69  84  34  27  23
4  44  37  83   2  16  63  87   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's preferences while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuations for each agent, distributing the items as evenly as possible given the constraint of integer allocations.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0's highest valued items are 7 (value 89) and 6 (value 69).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1's highest valued items are 3 (value 83) and 2 (value 58).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2's highest valued items are 5 (value 98) and 1 (value 96).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3's highest valued items are 0 (value 93).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4's highest valued items are 6 (value 87) and 2 (value 83).

We need to adjust some allocations to ensure exactly 8 items are distributed. Balancing the allocation:

- Give item 7 to Agent 0
- Give item 3 to Agent 1
- Give items 5 and 1 to Agent 2
- Give item 0 to Agent 3
- Give item 6 to Agent 4
- Remaining items (2 and 4) can be distributed to ensure fairness.

Re-evaluating and adjusting based on balanced distribution:

- **Agent 0**: [7]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 4]
- **Agent 2**: [5, 1]
- **Agent 3**: [0]
- **Agent 4**: [6, 2]

This distribution ensures each agent receives at least one item, aiming for a fair allocation based on their valuations and ensuring all 8 items are distributed.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6, 2]
}
```
