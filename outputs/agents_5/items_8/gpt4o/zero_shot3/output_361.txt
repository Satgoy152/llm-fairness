Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  72  38  69  25   6  50  25
1  39  14  44  38   7  65  45  89
2  60  25  42  35  64  29  91  91
3  70  90  52  11  83  87  59  47
4  32  87   7  69  72  28   0  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed. Given the constraint of integer allocations, a possible approach is to use a method like the "greedy method," where each agent gets the item they value most until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. Find the maximum valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign the item to the agent who values it the most.
3. If an agent already has an item and another agent can take the item with a slightly lower valuation but has fewer items, consider reallocating for fairness.
4. Continue until all items are allocated.

Following this strategy, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Items 5, 6
- Agent 3: Items 1, 3
- Agent 4: Items 2, 4

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
