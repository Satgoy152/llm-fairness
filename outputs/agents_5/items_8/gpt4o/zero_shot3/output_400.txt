Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  55  43  15  93  67  26  99
1  63   3  55  44  55  54  78   5
2  84  16  55  48  21   2  14  56
3  48  77  98  22  67  96  85  93
4  51   9  82  89  39  94  78  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations provided and aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is one potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Allocate items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1: Allocate items 1 and 6.
- Agent 2: Allocate items 2 and 7.
- Agent 3: Allocate item 5.
- Agent 4: Allocate item 3.

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent based on their preferences.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
