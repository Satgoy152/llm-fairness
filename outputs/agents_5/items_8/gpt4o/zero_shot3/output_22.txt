Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  96  58  81  48  60  21   8
1   0  66  43  10  82   9  59  42
2  21  35  58  94  55  85  40   8
3  95  28  48  92  26  21  89  82
4  93  76  81  52  24  48  75  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. Here is one way to approach it:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has and allocate that item if possible.
2. Try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item based on their preferences.
3. Distribute any remaining items while considering the preferences of the agents who have received fewer items.

Considering the given valuations, the allocations could be as follows:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 2.

After these allocations, we need to allocate the remaining items (5, 6, and 7) to balance the distribution based on remaining preferences.

Here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution considers their preferences.
