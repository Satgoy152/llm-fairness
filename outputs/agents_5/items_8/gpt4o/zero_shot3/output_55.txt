Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  19  29  23   6  72   7  32
1  74  54  44  72  36  23  57  72
2  87  19  47  13  96  91  63  97
3  45  70  88  34  84  70  73  32
4  21  36  81  18  12  53  96  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use a round-robin method based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets a share of items they value highly. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 2 has the highest valuation (97) for item 7, so item 7 is allocated to agent 2.
2. Agent 2 also highly values item 4 (96), so item 4 is allocated to agent 2.
3. Agent 3 has a high valuation (88) for item 2, so item 2 is allocated to agent 3.
4. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (74), so item 0 is allocated to agent 1.
5. Agent 1 also highly values item 3 (72), so item 3 is allocated to agent 1.
6. Agent 0 has a high valuation (72) for item 5, so item 5 is allocated to agent 0.
7. Agent 4 has a high valuation (96) for item 6, so item 6 is allocated to agent 4.
8. Agent 3 also values item 1 (70), so item 1 is allocated to agent 3.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations for the items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [6]
}
```
