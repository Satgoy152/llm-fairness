Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  31  77  40  98  53  13  59
1   2   1  61  24  52  43  64  47
2  29  16  75   6  20   6   6  79
3  93  67  75  60  83  68   1  33
4  47  27  13  91  48   8  47  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated equals 8. We will try to distribute the items so that the valuations are relatively balanced across agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Gets items 4 and 5. 
    - Valuation: 98 (item 4) + 53 (item 5) = 151

2. **Agent 1**: Gets items 2 and 6. 
    - Valuation: 61 (item 2) + 64 (item 6) = 125

3. **Agent 2**: Gets item 7. 
    - Valuation: 79 (item 7)

4. **Agent 3**: Gets items 0 and 3. 
    - Valuation: 93 (item 0) + 60 (item 3) = 153

5. **Agent 4**: Gets item 1. 
    - Valuation: 27 (item 1)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a subset of items and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
