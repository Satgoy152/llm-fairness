Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  40  68  87  71  83  35  20
1  22  26  94  50  68  28  38  73
2  25  80  16  81  43  86  90  55
3  21   1  25  42   9  44  83  78
4  16  70  63  81  45   6  40  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize each agentâ€™s total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (87), Item 5 (83)
   - Allocation: [3, 5]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (94), Item 7 (73)
   - Allocation: [2, 7]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (90), Item 1 (80)
   - Allocation: [6, 1]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (78), Item 6 (83)
   - Allocation: (already allocated, consider other items)
   - Allocation: []

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (81), Item 1 (70)
   - Allocation: (already allocated, consider other items)
   - Allocation: [0, 4]

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated and the allocation is balanced:

- Agent 0 gets items [3, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items [2, 7]
- Agent 2 gets items [6, 1]
- Agent 3 gets no items
- Agent 4 gets items [0, 4]

This allocation satisfies all constraints. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
