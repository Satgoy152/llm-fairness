Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  25  50  84  51  56  77  21
1   9  89  41  36  73  42  51  48
2  87  74  54  47  76  59  11  60
3  24  88  57  51  49  85  95  27
4  71  74  55  18  59  50   5  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the table below:

| Agent/Item | 0  | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| 0          | 25 | 25 | 50 | 84 | 51 | 56 | 77 | 21 |
| 1          | 9  | 89 | 41 | 36 | 73 | 42 | 51 | 48 |
| 2          | 87 | 74 | 54 | 47 | 76 | 59 | 11 | 60 |
| 3          | 24 | 88 | 57 | 51 | 49 | 85 | 95 | 27 |
| 4          | 71 | 74 | 55 | 18 | 59 | 50 | 5  | 83 |

Let's strategically assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible.

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most with 87.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most with 89.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most with 50.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most with 84.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most with 73.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most with 85.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most with 95.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it the most with 83.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it most, maximizing total satisfaction.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated, and agents receive an integer number of items.
