Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  83  11  90  59  17  30  85
1  91  73  39  20  19  86  66  98
2  20  38  82  23  33  58  55  81
3  75  24  52  90  72  79  14  89
4  61  57  78  72  30  53  49  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we'll consider giving each agent at least one item while maximizing the overall satisfaction. Hereâ€™s a suggested allocation:

1. Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, ensuring all items are distributed. 
2. If conflicts arise (i.e., two agents want the same item), resolve by comparing the valuations and assigning the item to the agent with the higher valuation for that item, while trying to maintain balance in the number of items each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (highest valuation for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item 7 (highest valuation for agent 1)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (highest valuation for agent 2)
- Agent 3: Item 5 (second highest valuation for agent 3)
- Agent 4: Items 0 (second highest valuation for agent 4)

Now, we have allocated 5 items. Let's distribute the remaining 3 items:

- Agent 1 can have item 5 as it has the second highest valuation for them.
- Agent 3 can have item 4 as it has a decent valuation for them.
- Agent 4 can have item 1 as it has a decent valuation for them.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent getting at least one item.
