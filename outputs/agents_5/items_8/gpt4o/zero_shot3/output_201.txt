Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  40   7  55  43  50   9  30
1  54  96   8  68  13  57  49   9
2  14  53  31  11  13  93  11  20
3  19  94  94   8  29   8  22  92
4  86  11  55   1  71  89  50  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider the valuations and aim for a distribution where each agent is satisfied with their allocations, while ensuring all 8 items are allocated. One common approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a whole number of items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. After initial allocations, adjust to ensure all items are allocated, and no agent receives more than they can appreciate.

Let's go through this process:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5.
- Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 has high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 3 values item 1 and 2.
- Agent 4 values item 0 and 5 highly.

Allocating based on these valuations while ensuring fairness:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (50), Item 3 (55)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (96), Item 4 (13)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (93)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (94)
- Agent 4: Item 6 (50), Item 7 (52)

Now, let's convert this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
