Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  81  16  28  89  87  66  77
1  85   2  85  83  72  35  25  64
2  80  48  70  11  36  88  33  35
3   5  70  10  85  82   8  24  43
4  23  46  37  15  65  32  80  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives based on their individual valuations. This problem is similar to a combinatorial optimization problem often referred to as the "assignment problem." Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items:** Check which items each agent values the most and attempt to allocate those items to the respective agents.
2. **Ensure Fairness:** Distribute items such that each agent gets a chance to receive items that they value highly, ensuring no agent is disproportionately disadvantaged.
3. **Allocate All Items:** Ensure all 8 items are allocated among the 5 agents.

Here's one potential solution:

- Agent 0 seems to value items 4 and 5 quite highly.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 3 and 4 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 6 highly.

Let's see how we can allocate these while ensuring each item goes to only one agent.

### Proposed Allocation

- **Agent 0:** Items [4, 5] (valuations: 89, 87)
- **Agent 1:** Items [0, 2] (valuations: 85, 85)
- **Agent 2:** Item [1] (valuation: 48)
- **Agent 3:** Items [3] (valuation: 85)
- **Agent 4:** Items [6, 7] (valuations: 80, 74)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items that they value reasonably well.

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
