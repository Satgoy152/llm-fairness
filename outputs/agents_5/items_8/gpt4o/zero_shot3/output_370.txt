Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  30  82  41  17  27  59  16
1  96  24  87  52  18  29  45  48
2   4  83  75  99  35  96   2  29
3  89  24  21  20  51  52  29  22
4  10  52   0  42  53  47  18  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. This approach ensures that each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most, thereby maximizing overall satisfaction. However, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item. Given that we have 8 items and 5 agents, we can follow this modified approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If any agent ends up with no items, reassign one of the items from the agent with the most items to ensure every agent gets at least one.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 96 by Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 83 by Agent 2.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 87 by Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 99 by Agent 2.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 53 by Agent 4.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 96 by Agent 2.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 59 by Agent 0.
8. Item 7: Highest value is 48 by Agent 1.

Initial allocation:
- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [0, 2, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 3, 5]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [4]

Agent 3 has no items. To address this, we can reallocate one item from an agent with multiple items, ensuring each agent has at least one item:

Revised allocation:
- Move item 7 from Agent 1 to Agent 3.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [1, 3, 5]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [4]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4]
}
```
