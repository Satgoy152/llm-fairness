Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  13   3  93  21  64  38  96
1  24  87  88  20  35  52  24  14
2  14  68  70  52  91  38  93  27
3  54  13  98  73  80   8  65  15
4   1  69  30  98  39   1  49  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for each agent to receive items that maximize their satisfaction while ensuring all items are distributed. Given that there are 8 items and 5 agents, it's not possible to give each agent an equal number of items. However, an equitable approach can be to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to an item, while ensuring each item is assigned to only one agent.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 0 (96).
  
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 1 (88).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 6 has the highest value for Agent 2 (93).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 2 has already been assigned. Item 4 has the next highest value (80), but item 6 has been assigned. Therefore, assign Item 3 (73).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 3 has been assigned. Item 7 has the next highest value (85).

Now, let's see the remaining items: 0, 1, and 5 need to be assigned.

6. Assign remaining items to agents with the next highest unassigned value:
   - Agent 0: Item 5, as Item 7 is already assigned.
   - Agent 1: Item 1.
   - Agent 4: Item 0.

This yields the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives 1 or 2 items, maximizing their satisfaction based on the given valuations.
