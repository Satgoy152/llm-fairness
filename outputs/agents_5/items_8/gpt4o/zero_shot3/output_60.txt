Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  57  94   9  75  56  73  63
1  80   8  64  96  77  18  63  78
2  62  57  72   1  20  60   4  74
3  78  63  30  62   6  23  61  30
4  33   2  64  74  94  83  36  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach based on maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Here, we'll employ a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

First, let's assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 80 (highest).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 and Agent 2 value it at 57. We can assign it to Agent 0 arbitrarily.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 94 (highest).
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 96 (highest).
5. Item 4: Agent 4 values it at 94 (highest).
6. Item 5: Agent 4 values it at 83 (highest).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it at 73 (highest).
8. Item 7: Agent 4 values it at 80 (highest).

After assigning items to agents based on their highest value, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: Items [4, 5, 7]

This allocation gives us a balanced distribution where each agent gets an integer number of items. Agent 2 and Agent 3 end up with no items, which is acceptable as per the problem statement.

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 6],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4, 5, 7]
}
```
