Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  65  70  83  19  15  36  50
1  56  99  76  36  98  14   5  71
2  47  52  49  52  15  97  18  65
3  53  70  11  18  62  14  42  28
4   0  57  79  12   7  43  63  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent**: This involves determining which items each agent values the most.

2. **Allocate items to agents**: Distribute the items starting with the highest individual valuations, ensuring that each item is only assigned once.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Revisit any unallocated items and assign them to agents with remaining capacity or lower total valuations.

Let's go through this process and determine a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are items 3 (83), 2 (70), and 1 (65).
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are items 1 (99), 4 (98), and 2 (76).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are items 5 (97), 7 (65), and 3 (52).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are items 1 (70), 4 (62), and 0 (53).
- **Agent 4**: Highest values are items 2 (79), 1 (57), and 6 (63).

We will assign items based on the highest value each agent places on an unassigned item:

1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 99).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 83).
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 97).
4. Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (value 79).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 53).

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (4, 6, 7):

6. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 98).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (value 63).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (value 65).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations available, and all items are distributed.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items fairly among the 5 agents.
