Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  37  88  78  21  13  91  50
1  52  44  77  32  35  32  77   9
2  60  72  80  79  56  30  57  91
3   4  88   9  21   7  57  20  33
4  19   5  32  78  95  83  45   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation based on the table provided:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Allocate item 6 (value 91) and item 2 (value 88).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate item 0 (value 52) and item 1 (value 44).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate item 7 (value 91) and item 3 (value 79).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocate item 5 (value 57).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Allocate item 4 (value 95).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an allocation of items that reflects, to some extent, their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items among the 5 agents while considering their preferences as indicated by the valuations.
