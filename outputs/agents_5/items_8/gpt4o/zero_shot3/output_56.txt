Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  92  59  55  17  34  65  53
1  55  35  78  26  29  54  36  24
2  26  67  65  69   5  11  95  47
3  47  82  78  48  55  37  80  90
4  35   6  82  76  26  62  93  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[74 92 59 55 17 34 65 53]
 [55 35 78 26 29 54 36 24]
 [26 67 65 69  5 11 95 47]
 [47 82 78 48 55 37 80 90]
 [35  6 82 76 26 62 93 90]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Let's try to maximize the total value for each agent based on their individual preferences for the items.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 1 (92), 0 (74), and 2 (59). Let's give agent 0 items 1 and 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values are for items 2 (78), 5 (54), and 0 (55). Let's give agent 1 item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values are for items 6 (95), 3 (69), and 1 (67). Let's give agent 2 item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest values are for items 7 (90), 6 (80), and 1 (82). Let's give agent 3 item 7.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest values are for items 6 (93), 7 (90), and 2 (82). Let's give agent 4 items 3, 4, and 5.

Let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Item [6]
- Agent 3: Item [7]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 4, 5]

All items have been allocated, and each agent has an integer number of items. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
