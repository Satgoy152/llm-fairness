Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  50  51  94  95  57  19  28
1   4  83  12  95  17  46  43  94
2  93   1  93  26  27  91  19  67
3  74  27  62  30  20  65   6  87
4  62  63  80  44  92  59  61  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values items 3 and 4 highly (94 and 95, respectively). Thus, we allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 1 (83) and item 7 (94). We allocate these items to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 (93) and item 2 (93) the highest. We allocate these items to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5 (65) and item 7 (87) relatively high, but item 7 is already taken. We assign item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 6 (61). We allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, let's summarize these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This distribution ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
