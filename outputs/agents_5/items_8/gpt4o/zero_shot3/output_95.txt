Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  33  88  37  57  86  12  44
1  55  70   3  18  80  58  96  55
2  85  35  58  42   3  92  78  99
3  90  23  46   3  69  81  12  87
4  33  98  48  35  49  61  85  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider both the valuations and the need to distribute exactly 8 items, ensuring no agent is left without consideration. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are relatively high for items 0, 2, and 5. Let's assign them items 0 and 2.

2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 6. We'll assign them item 6.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 7 the most, so we can assign them item 7.

4. **Agent 3**: High valuations for items 0 and 5, but since item 0 is already assigned, we'll assign item 5.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 1, so we'll assign that item to them.

Now, we have assigned 5 items. We still need to allocate 3 more items. Let's assign the remaining items based on relatively high valuations for the remaining items:

- **Agent 1** can receive item 4, as it has a high valuation for it.
- **Agent 3** can receive item 3.
- **Agent 4** can receive item 6, which is also a high-valued item for them.

Here's the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
