Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  54  68   1  41   8  25  19
1  37  69  79  77  63  35  42  99
2  17  56  32  47  34  63  35  66
3  85  85  32  23  99  82  92  45
4  53   0  40  29  19  73  44  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction based on given valuations. Keeping these considerations in mind, here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that maximize Agent 0's satisfaction based on their unique valuations compared to others.

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items where Agent 1 has significantly higher valuations compared to others.

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that are left and best match Agent 2's preferences.

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items where Agent 3 has the highest valuations, especially if those valuations are unmatched by others.

5. **Agent 4**: Allocate remaining items that maximize Agent 4's satisfaction.

Here is a potential allocation based on the provided data:

- **Agent 0**: Items [2, 0] (valuations 68 and 47, relatively high for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: Items [1, 7] (valuations 69 and 99, strong preferences for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: Item [5] (valuation 63 is reasonable for Agent 2)
- **Agent 3**: Items [4, 6] (valuations 99 and 92, very high for Agent 3)
- **Agent 4**: Item [3] (valuation 29, least contested)

In JSON format, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the total number of items and the valuations to provide a fair distribution among all agents.
