Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  78  97  39  31  48  61  94
1  25  20  54  51  78  93  82  36
2  43  47  22  93  41  50  38  92
3  40  87  54   3   2  59   2   7
4  28  64  34  37   0   9  12  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider using a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Given the data, let's try to allocate the items such that each agent gets some of their higher-valued items, keeping in mind that each agent should get an integer number of items and all items should be allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 7.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 3.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 1.
5. Agent 4 has no extremely high valuations, but we can assign the remaining items to ensure they receive some items.

Based on this strategy, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [5]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [1]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 6]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a number of items according to their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
