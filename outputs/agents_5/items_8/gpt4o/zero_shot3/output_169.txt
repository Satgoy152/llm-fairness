Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  98  18  35  25   2  84  30
1   8  18  34  46  59  31  50  92
2  44  55  99  56  92  86  14  44
3  87  39  65   9  22  71  19  63
4  76  83  26  78  17  40  73  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Let's evaluate the table and attempt to allocate the items based on the highest values for each agent.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:
- Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations, trying to ensure fairness and balance in distribution.

**Allocation Process:**
1. Agent 0: 
   - Highest values: 98 (Item 1), 84 (Item 6).
2. Agent 1: 
   - Highest values: 92 (Item 7).
3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: 99 (Item 2), 92 (Item 4).
4. Agent 3:
   - Highest values: 87 (Item 0).
5. Agent 4:
   - Highest values: 83 (Item 3), 78 (Item 5).

**Final Allocation:**
- Agent 0: Items [1, 6]
- Agent 1: Item [7]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 3: Item [0]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 5]

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed and attempts to give each agent the most valuable items according to their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```
