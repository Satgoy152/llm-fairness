Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  61  46  25  95   4  24  59
1  24  50  53  26  63  37  49   4
2  93  24  93  49   8  64  22  69
3   0  15  80  69  32  73  47  89
4  97  78  40  20  95  36  78  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, not all agents will get the same number of items. However, we should attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent or distribute them evenly based on their preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items while considering fairness:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to each agent by selecting the items with the highest value for each agent, considering that the total number of items distributed should be 8.

Let's calculate and allocate accordingly:

- Agent 0: Values: [51, 61, 46, 25, 95, 4, 24, 59] -> Total: 365
- Agent 1: Values: [24, 50, 53, 26, 63, 37, 49, 4] -> Total: 306
- Agent 2: Values: [93, 24, 93, 49, 8, 64, 22, 69] -> Total: 422
- Agent 3: Values: [0, 15, 80, 69, 32, 73, 47, 89] -> Total: 405
- Agent 4: Values: [97, 78, 40, 20, 95, 36, 78, 46] -> Total: 490

Now, allocate items to each agent based on their highest preferences:

- Agent 4 has the highest total valuation, so prioritize some of their top valued items.
- Continue in descending order of total valuation.

Allocation:
- Agent 4: Items 0 (97), 4 (95) — Highest values
- Agent 2: Items 2 (93), 0 (93) — Next highest values, but 0 already allocated, so choose 2
- Agent 3: Items 7 (89), 2 (80) — Next highest, but 2 already allocated, choose 7
- Agent 0: Item 4 (95) already allocated, choose 1 (61)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (53) already allocated, choose 5 (37)

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

Note: Given constraints, some items may be reassigned to ensure each agent gets items and all items are allocated. The distribution aims for fairness, adjusting for prior allocations.
