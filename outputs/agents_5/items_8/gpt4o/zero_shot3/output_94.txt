Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  52  70  86  56  98  77   8
1  84  61  33  58  37  10  15  93
2  19  16  57  46  17  93   9  56
3  74   1  12  16  63  32  13  78
4  97  39   8  65  16   3  44  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider various strategies, such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent or ensuring that each agent receives an equitable share of the items based on their preferences. Let's try to allocate the items so that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0: Agent 0 values item 3 at 86, which is one of the highest valuations.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 4: Agent 4 values item 0 at 97, which is the highest valuation for item 0.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 1 at 61.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 2: Agent 2 values item 5 at 93, which is the highest valuation for item 5.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3: Agent 3 values item 4 at 63.
6. Assign item 7 to agent 1: Agent 1 values item 7 at 93.
7. Assign item 2 to agent 0: Agent 0 values item 2 at 70.
8. Assign item 6 to agent 3: Agent 3 values item 6 at 13.

This allocation attempts to give each agent at least one item they value highly. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent gets at least one item, aligning with their preferences as much as possible.
