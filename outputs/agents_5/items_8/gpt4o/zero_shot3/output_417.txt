Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  98  73  77  60  41  56   8
1  61  12  80  78  75  78  58  39
2  57  18  22   7  73  35  37  24
3   5  36   3  63  20  42  71  18
4  21  97  72  79  10   7  96  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider maximizing the satisfaction of each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's one way to approach this allocation problem:

1. **Assign the highest valued item for each agent first**: Start by identifying the highest valued item for each agent and try to allocate that item to them if it's not already taken.

2. **Resolve conflicts**: If multiple agents have the highest valuation for the same item, prioritize based on overall highest valuations or try to distribute the items so that each agent gets a fair share.

3. **Iterate through remaining items**: For unallocated items, assign them to agents who value them relatively high compared to other available items.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for item 1 (98) and item 2 (73). Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for item 2 (80) and item 5 (78). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for item 4 (73). Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for item 6 (71). Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for item 1 (97) but it is already allocated, so allocate item 7 (78) to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We still need to allocate the remaining 3 items: 0, 3, and 5.

- **Item 0**: Next highest valuation is Agent 1 (61), allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Next highest valuation is Agent 4 (79), allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
- **Item 5**: Next highest valuation is Agent 1 (78), allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```

These allocations ensure that each agent gets at least one item they value relatively highly while distributing all items fairly.
