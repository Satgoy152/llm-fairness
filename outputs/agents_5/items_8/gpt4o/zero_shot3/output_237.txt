Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  32   3  27  50  65  68  38
1  34  53  61  59  24  47  52  67
2  40  56  75  54  57  50  84  88
3  89  15  18  76  68  93  59  18
4  82  20  83  30  17  66  62  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 20 83 30 17 66 62 46]]
Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is assigned. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 0: Value 99

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 7: Value 67

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 6: Value 84
   - Item 2: Value 75

4. Agent 3:
   - Item 5: Value 93
   - Item 3: Value 76

5. Agent 4:
   - Item 4: Value 17
   - Item 1: Value 20

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation fairly distributes the items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a share of the items.
