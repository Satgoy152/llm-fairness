Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  96  31  60  86  44  14  80
1  23  38  24  66  62  71  80  92
2  71  28  63  49   8  14  70  44
3  68  94  61  36  48  54   7  56
4   0  63  53  82  76  59  23  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and attempt to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction. One method to achieve this is to assign items to the agent who values them the most until each agent has an approximately equal number of items, considering there are 8 items and 5 agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 78 by Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 96 by Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 63 by Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 82 by Agent 4.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 86 by Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 71 by Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: The highest value is 80 by Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: The highest value is 92 by Agent 1.

After assigning based on maximum values, we adjust to ensure a fair distribution:

1. Agent 0 initially gets items 0, 1, and 4.
2. Agent 1 initially gets items 5, 6, and 7.
3. Agent 2 gets item 2.
4. Agent 4 gets item 3.

To balance it out:
- Reassign Item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 3 (second highest value is 94, by Agent 3) to ensure Agent 3 gets an item.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, except for Agent 2, who receives a valuable item (Item 2). All items are distributed, and no agent has more than 3 items, which is the closest to an even distribution possible given the constraints.
