Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95   4  85  45  59   7  13  53
1   1  14  87  85  40  53  45  84
2  59  49  79  95  81  25  78  20
3  45  45   5  41  20  13  74  87
4  75  99  55  32  57  82  67  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy where we aim to maximize each agent's total value for the items they receive. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Compute the total valuation each agent has for all items combined to understand their overall preference strength.

2. **Assign Items**: Start by assigning items to agents based on their individual highest preferences, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

3. **Ensure Fairness**: Check that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and that all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation process based on the table provided:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Highest valuation is for item 0 (95).
  
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Highest valuation is for item 2 (87).
  
- **Agent 2**: 
  - Highest valuation is for item 3 (95).
  
- **Agent 3**: 
  - Highest valuation is for item 7 (87).
  
- **Agent 4**: 
  - Highest valuation is for item 1 (99).

Now, allocate the remaining items considering the next highest preferences:

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Already has item 0. Next highest is item 2, but it's taken, so allocate item 3 (45).
  
- **Agent 1**: 
  - Already has item 2. Next highest is item 7 (84).
  
- **Agent 2**: 
  - Already has item 3. Next highest is item 6 (78).
  
- **Agent 3**: 
  - Already has item 7. Next highest is item 6, but it's taken, so allocate item 4 (20).

- **Agent 4**: 
  - Already has item 1. Next highest is item 5 (82).

After this allocation, we must ensure all items are allocated. Hereâ€™s the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to one agent, aiming for a fair distribution based on the agents' valuations.
