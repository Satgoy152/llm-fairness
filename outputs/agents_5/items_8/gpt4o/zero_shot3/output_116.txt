Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  24  69  62  71  91  95  81
1  60   7  30  33  88  13  25  67
2  83  54  95  77  37  48  57  93
3  68  75  83  82  28  27  26  45
4  46  31  36   0   4  86  48  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 8 items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 6 (95) and item 5 (91) very highly. These are the highest values on the board and should be allocated to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 4 (88) and item 7 (67).
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 (95) and item 7 (93) highly. Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as item 7 is already allocated to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 1 (75) and item 3 (82) highly. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 5 (86) highly, but it's already allocated to Agent 0. Assign item 0 (46) to Agent 4.

Given these allocations, we can now distribute the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: [6, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [4, 7]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: [3, 1]
- **Agent 4**: [0]

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [0]
}
``` 

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share of items based on their preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
