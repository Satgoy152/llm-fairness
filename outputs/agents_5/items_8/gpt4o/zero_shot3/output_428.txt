Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  31   3  99  13  60  98   4
1  72  59   0  86   5  67  82  69
2  37  34  62  97  95  96  63   6
3  59  16  89  41  50  67  20  65
4  67  68  13  60  39  45  39  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [67 68 13 60 39 45 39 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we can use a strategy such as maximizing the total value each agent receives or trying to ensure that allocations are as balanced as possible based on their valuations.

Given the valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  31   3  99  13  60  98   4
1  72  59   0  86   5  67  82  69
2  37  34  62  97  95  96  63   6
3  59  16  89  41  50  67  20  65
4  67  68  13  60  39  45  39  66
```

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items that are clear high-value choices for certain agents.
2. Distribute remaining items to balance the worth received by each agent.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (99) and item 0 (95).
- Agent 1 values item 6 (82) and item 5 (67).
- Agent 2 values item 5 (96) and item 4 (95).
- Agent 3 values item 2 (89).
- Agent 4 values item 1 (68).

After considering these, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [6]
- Agent 2: Items [5]
- Agent 3: Items [2]
- Agent 4: Items [1, 4, 7]

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents with each agent getting at least one item, and the allocation does not exceed the total number of items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4, 7]
}
```
