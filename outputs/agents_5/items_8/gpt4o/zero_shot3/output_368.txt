Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  19  63  53  89  14  65  33
1  39   2  49  19  90  52  38  75
2  17  67  39  72  79  49  14  25
3  89  33  49  94  71  28   1  90
4  50  12  45  84  27  44  88  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's approach this by considering both maximizing individual agent satisfaction and distributing items evenly.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (89), Item 6 (65), Item 0 (63)
   - Allocate: Items 0 and 6

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (90), Item 7 (75)
   - Allocate: Items 4 and 7

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (72), Item 1 (67)
   - Allocate: Items 1 and 3

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (94), Item 7 (90) - already taken
   - Allocate: Item 5

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest values: Item 6 (88) - already taken, Item 3 (84) - already taken
   - Allocate: Item 2

Now, we ensure each agent gets at least one item and all 8 items are allocated.

The allocation can be summarized as:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations while covering all items.
