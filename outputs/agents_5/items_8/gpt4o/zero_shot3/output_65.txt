Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  18  13  13  46  32  96  59   6
1  33  38  57  70  52  53  15  75
2  74  54  66  23  91  65  60  74
3  12  90   3  85  80  67  60  74
4  88  13   8  25  44  52  95  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. This can be achieved using a greedy approach, considering the highest valuations for each agent.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the individual agent's valuation:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 5 (96).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 7 (75).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (91).
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 1 (90).
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 0 (88).

After assigning these items, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items. We will choose items with the highest remaining valuations among the unallocated items:

6. **Agent 2** has the next highest valuation for item 0 (74), but it's already allocated. Therefore, we check the next highest from the unallocated items, which is item 2 (66).
7. **Agent 3** has the next highest valuation for item 3 (85).
8. **Agent 0** has the next highest valuation for item 6 (59).

With these assignments, all 8 items are allocated. Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuation for the items.
