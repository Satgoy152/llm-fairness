Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  93   3  16  63  21   2  54  10
1  88  49  20  77  35  75  22  49
2  28  50  95  41  51  98  80  15
3   5  13  83  73  35  77  52  44
4  62   5  42  58  29  96  17  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents. The goal is to find an allocation that is as fair as possible, potentially considering the maximum valuation each agent can get from the items.

Let's analyze a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 0 (93). Assigning this item to agent 0 would be beneficial.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 3 (77) and item 5 (75). Assigning item 3 to agent 1 would maximize their valuation.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 (98) and item 2 (95) highly. Assigning item 5 to agent 2 would benefit them greatly.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 (83) highly. Assigning item 2 to agent 3 would give them the highest possible valuation for a single item.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 5 (96) highly, but since item 5 is already allocated, we consider other items such as item 3 (58) or item 4 (29). Assigning item 4 to agent 4 could be beneficial.

Based on the above analysis, we need to ensure that each agent receives some items, and all items are allocated efficiently. Here is a potential allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to agent 2.
- Assign item 2 to agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to agent 4.
- Assign item 6 to agent 0 (another item with reasonable value).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (next best valuation).
- Assign item 7 to agent 2 (another item with reasonable value).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item, with a focus on maximizing their respective valuations.
