Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  13  12  67  27  85  47  89
1  47  94  50  14  83   5  44  98
2   4  99   2   7  93  29  30   8
3  50  45  83  72  98  31   5  27
4  72  98  21  36  58  79  36  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuation for Each Agent:** Start by identifying the item with the highest valuation for each agent. This will help ensure that each agent gets at least one item they highly value.

2. **Allocate Items Based on Maximum Valuation:**
   - Agent 0: Item 7 (Value: 89)
   - Agent 1: Item 7 (Value: 98) [already taken, choose next highest]
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (Value: 94)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (Value: 99) [already taken, choose next highest]
   - Agent 2: Item 4 (Value: 93)
   - Agent 3: Item 4 (Value: 98) [already taken, choose next highest]
   - Agent 3: Item 2 (Value: 83)
   - Agent 4: Item 1 (Value: 98) [already taken, choose next highest]
   - Agent 4: Item 0 (Value: 72)

3. **Resolve Conflicts and Ensure All Items Are Allocated:**
   - Some items may have multiple agents desiring them based on their highest valuation. Allocate based on the next highest value available to each agent and ensure all items are used.

4. **Remaining Items:** Allocate remaining items to agents in a way that increases their total valuation, considering items not yet assigned.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 0

Now, allocate the remaining items (3, 5, 6):

- Agent 0: Item 5 (second-highest value after item 7)
- Agent 1: Item 6 (as 44 is the next highest evaluation after item 1)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (as 72 is a high evaluation after item 2)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items valuing their preferences, and all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
