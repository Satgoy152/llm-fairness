Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  75  77  32  95  72  29  50
1  47  73  64  98   3  76  64  40
2  95  93  52   1  90  82  84  61
3  72  58  66  47   3  43   0  87
4  25  20  21  51  69  64  27  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[86 75 77 32 95 72 29 50]
 [47 73 64 98  3 76 64 40]
 [95 93 52  1 90 82 84 61]
 [72 58 66 47  3 43  0 87]
 [25 20 21 51 69 64 27 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can aim to distribute them such that each agent's total valuation of their assigned items is as balanced as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 4
   - Valuation for item 0: 86
   - Valuation for item 4: 95
   - Total: 181

2. **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 3
   - Valuation for item 1: 73
   - Valuation for item 3: 98
   - Total: 171

3. **Agent 2**: Items 5
   - Valuation for item 5: 82
   - Total: 82

4. **Agent 3**: Items 7
   - Valuation for item 7: 87
   - Total: 87

5. **Agent 4**: Items 2 and 6
   - Valuation for item 2: 21
   - Valuation for item 6: 27
   - Total: 48

The allocations are fairly balanced given the constraints, and all 8 items are allocated. Here's the JSON representation of these allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```
