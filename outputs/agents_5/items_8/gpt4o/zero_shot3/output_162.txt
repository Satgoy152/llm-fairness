Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  39  96  80  11  26  13  20
1   6  94  14   7  22  67  41  22
2   6  17  16  51  27  70  21  95
3  70  54   7  23  42  36  59  78
4  63  14  27  44   6  20  10   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [63 14 27 44  6 20 10  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the overall valuation by assigning items to agents who value them the most. Each agent should ideally get at least one item, and the total number of items allocated must be exactly eight.

Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If an agent ends up with more than two items, reassign items to other agents to balance the allocation while considering the next highest valuation.

Following these steps, we arrive at the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 4: Items [4]

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total allocation adds up to 8 items.
