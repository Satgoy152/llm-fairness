Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  30  17  59   7  33  43  94
1  96  77  19  90  25  22  85  25
2  84  78   6  41  40  66  57  93
3  97  58  82  17  49  40  88  62
4  86  58  86  93  11  96  71  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach for this is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 values it the highest (97).
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest (78).
3. Item 2: Agent 3 values it the highest (82).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the highest (59).
5. Item 4: Agent 3 values it the highest (49).
6. Item 5: Agent 4 values it the highest (96).
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values it the highest (88).
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the highest (94).

After allocating based on the highest valuation, we need to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated in total. Here's a reallocation to achieve this:

- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 0, 2, 6
- Agent 4: Items 4, 5

Here's the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 2, 6],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of items based on their valuations.
