Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  30   7  38  92  31  57  61
1  45   4  44  43  11  73  52  63
2  25  45  42  54  17   8  88  34
3  48  72   1  25  82  84  56  57
4  37  47  44  38  70  51  16  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent gets at least one item. We will aim to distribute the items to maximize each agent's total valuation based on their preferences. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4 (value of 92), so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 5 (value of 73), so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 6 (value of 88), so we allocate item 6 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1 (value of 72), so we allocate item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 3 (value of 38), so we allocate item 3 to agent 4.

Now we have 3 items remaining: 0, 2, and 7. We'll distribute these remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

6. Agent 0 values item 0 (value of 66) second highest, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
7. Agent 3 values item 7 (value of 57) second highest, so we allocate item 7 to agent 3.
8. Agent 4 values item 2 (value of 44) highest among remaining, so we allocate item 2 to agent 4.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and each agent receives at least one item while maximizing their valuations.
