Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  23  12  59  77  50  90  81  83
1  63  75  59  67  70  82  50   2
2  21  17  60   1   0   1  13  52
3  63  98  24  86  56  76  24  83
4  30  76   1  84  41  98  55  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This problem can be approached similarly to a fair division or assignment problem, potentially aiming for a solution where the total valuation for all agents is maximized.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Starting with the highest value items for each agent:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 90)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (value 75)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (value 60)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (value 98)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (value 98)

Since each agent must get at least one item, and some items are already allocated to multiple agents, we will adjust the allocations to ensure each agent gets distinct items.

Let's adjust:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 4 (value 98)
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 3 (value 98)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (value 63)
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 0 (value 77)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (value 60)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 3 (value 83)
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1 (value 70)
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0 (value 81)

Now, let's ensure all 8 items are allocated:

  - Agent 0: Items [3, 6]
  - Agent 1: Items [0, 4]
  - Agent 2: Item [2]
  - Agent 3: Items [1, 7]
  - Agent 4: Item [5]

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, all items are allocated, and the total valuation is reasonably distributed.
