Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84   8  43  55  45  71  43  41
1  99  94  41  53  56  75  26  45
2  70   0   0  90  22  58   8  14
3   5  73  25  90  61  88  26  27
4  81  43  32  76  42  44  13  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation based on their given preferences. Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If an agent ends up with more than their fair share (considering there are 5 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally have 1 or 2 items), make adjustments to balance the allocation while trying to keep the total value for each agent as high as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0:** The highest valuation is from agent 1 (99). Assign item 0 to agent 1.
- **Item 1:** The highest valuation is from agent 1 (94). Assign item 1 to agent 1.
- **Item 2:** The highest valuation is from agent 0 (43). Assign item 2 to agent 0.
- **Item 3:** The highest valuation is from agent 2 and agent 3 (90 each). Assign item 3 to agent 2 to balance allocations.
- **Item 4:** The highest valuation is from agent 3 (61). Assign item 4 to agent 3.
- **Item 5:** The highest valuation is from agent 3 (88). Assign item 5 to agent 3.
- **Item 6:** The highest valuation is from agent 0 (43). Assign item 6 to agent 0.
- **Item 7:** The highest valuation is from agent 0 (41). Assign item 7 to agent 0.

Now let's check the total number of items each agent has:

- Agent 0: 3 items (2, 6, 7)
- Agent 1: 2 items (0, 1)
- Agent 2: 1 item (3)
- Agent 3: 2 items (4, 5)
- Agent 4: 0 items

To ensure fairness, let's adjust the allocation to give agent 4 at least one item from agent 0, who currently has 3 items:

- Transfer item 7 from agent 0 to agent 4.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has a fair share of items while keeping the overall valuations balanced.
