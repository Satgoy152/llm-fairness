Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  91  61  98  97  29  73  10
1  23  47  97  43  21  83  89   7
2  45  53  31  85  32  34  38   8
3  15  31  48  61  14  39  73   5
4  22  43  93  48  71  28  19  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent has for the items they receive. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 0 and 3 equally (98 each), so we'll assign them item 0 and item 3. 
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the most (97), so we'll assign them item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 1 the most (53), so we'll assign them item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 6 the most (73), so we'll assign them item 6.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 4 the most (71), so we'll assign them item 4.

After these allocations, the remaining items are item 5 and item 7. Continuing with our strategy:

- **Agent 1**: Already has item 2, but also values item 5 (83). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 4**: Only has item 4. Among the remaining items, item 7 is valued at 41, which is the highest remaining value for Agent 4. Assign item 7 to Agent 4.

This distribution attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences. Hereâ€™s the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
