Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  16  51  96   1  49  18  12
1  90  71  86   3  72  41  98  16
2  31  48  97  41  45  72  82  66
3  96  65  83  67  13  44  88  27
4   6  84  28  37  21  13  27  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable distribution of items based on their valuations. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents, considering their individual valuations for each item. 

To achieve this, we will consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate those accordingly while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (96), so we give item 3 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the highest (98), so we give item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (97), so we give item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (96), so we give item 0 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the highest (92), so we give item 7 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate the remaining 3 items. We will consider the next highest valuations for each agent and allocate accordingly:

6. Agent 1 values item 0 next highest (90), but item 0 is already allocated. Therefore, we consider the next highest available item, which is item 1 (71) for agent 1.
7. Agent 2 values item 5 next highest (72), so we give item 5 to agent 2.
8. Agent 3 values item 6 next highest (88), but item 6 is already allocated. Therefore, we consider the next highest available item, which is item 4 (13) for agent 3.

After this allocation, all items are distributed among the agents. The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [7]
}
```
