Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31   3  14  34  62  54  43  88
1  22  36   8  92  40  87  71  67
2  82   2  83  88  56   0  36  60
3   0  33  85  17  45  49  36  98
4  40  79  28  68   5  87  18  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should strive to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is assigned. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High Value Matches**: Start by identifying the highest value each agent places on the available items, ensuring each item is only assigned once.

2. **Distribute Based on High Value**: Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

3. **Ensure Fairness**: If an agent ends up with too many items, redistribute to ensure fairness and that each agent gets a reasonable number of items based on their valuations.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are on items 7, 4, 3. Initially allocate item 7.
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are on items 3, 5, 7. Allocate item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are on items 2, 0, 3. Allocate item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are on items 7, 2, 5. Allocate item 2.
- **Agent 4**: Highest values are on items 1, 5, 3. Allocate item 5.

This initial allocation covers 5 of the 8 items: [7, 3, 0, 2, 5].

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 4, 6):

- **For item 1**: Agent 4 highly values it. Allocate item 1 to agent 4.
- **For item 4**: Agent 0 values it. Allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- **For item 6**: Agent 1 values it. Allocate item 6 to agent 1.

Now, ensure each agent has at least one item and all items are assigned.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 1]
}
```

This ensures a fair distribution where all items are allocated, and each agent has a share based on their highest valuations.
