Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99   6  13  66   8   9  79  51
1   5  73  66  29  14  94  38  55
2   2  57  77   7   5  15  63  16
3  23  90  11   5  73  30  92   4
4  44  74  49  75  20  55  74  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. A reasonable approach is to make sure the sum of values for each agent is balanced, while also ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Based on the values, agent 0 highly values item 0 (99) and item 6 (79).
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 5 (94) and item 1 (73).
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 2 (77).
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 3 (75) and item 4 (73).
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 highly values item 7 (51).

Let's allocate the items in this manner:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 6]
- Agent 1 gets items [1, 5]
- Agent 2 gets item [2]
- Agent 3 gets item [4]
- Agent 4 gets item [3, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```
