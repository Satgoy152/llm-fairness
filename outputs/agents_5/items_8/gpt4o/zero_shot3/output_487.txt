Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  92  21   6  82  31  21  58
1  30  91  36  82   8   4  12   7
2  97  79  66  64  68  85  58  97
3  30  41  90  37  38  48  45  23
4  88  20  27  96  20  55  59  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 3 92 21  6 82 31 21 58]
 [30 91 36 82  8  4 12  7]
 [97 79 66 64 68 85 58 97]
 [30 41 90 37 38 48 45 23]
 [88 20 27 96 20 55 59 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences. We will aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 1 (value 92)
   - Item 4 (value 82)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 3 (value 82)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 0 (value 97)
   - Item 2 (value 66)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 5 (value 48)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Item 6 (value 59)
   - Item 7 (value 72)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```
