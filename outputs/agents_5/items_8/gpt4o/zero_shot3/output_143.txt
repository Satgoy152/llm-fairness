Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  43  80  40  59  70  47  32
1   2  43  80  26  55  18  46  66
2  23  34   1  50  10  17   2  40
3  47  11  50  58  89  79  95  17
4  85  58   9  21  15  66  38  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, resulting in a total of 8 items being allocated. The goal is to maximize fairness, which can mean different things such as maximizing the minimum value any agent receives or ensuring everyone gets a somewhat balanced share based on their preferences.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items that are highly valued by them.
- Agent 1 receives items that they value relatively high, considering what other agents value.
- Agent 2 receives items with the highest value they can get.
- Agent 3 receives items with high values for them.
- Agent 4 receives items they value the most.

Based on the above considerations, here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 7
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 4, 6
- Agent 4: Item 5

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 (98) and 2 (80) with high values.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 (43) and 7 (66) with decent values relative to other items.
- Agent 2 receives item 3 (50), which is the highest available value for them.
- Agent 3 receives items 4 (89) and 6 (95), which are highly valued.
- Agent 4 receives item 5 (66), one of the higher values they can get.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated fairly based on the given valuations.
