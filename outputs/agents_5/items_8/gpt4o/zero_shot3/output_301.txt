Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53   9  12  90  19   9  82  59
1  91  23  98  76  13  17  65  65
2  93  35  88  93  84  76  44  18
3   6  62   7  38  32   0  95  17
4   3  30  33  68  45  18   2  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [91 23 98 76 13 17 65 65]
 [93 35 88 93 84 76 44 18]

 [ 3 30 33 68 45 18  2 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuation of the items. A possible strategy is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent. We can do this by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's start by examining the valuations for each item and assign each to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most with 93.
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most with 62.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most with 98.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with 90.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most with 84.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most with 76.
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most with 95.
8. Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most with 61.

Let's look at the allocation now:
- Agent 0 has item 3.
- Agent 1 has item 2.
- Agent 2 has items 0, 4, and 5.
- Agent 3 has items 1 and 6.
- Agent 4 has item 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4, 5],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
