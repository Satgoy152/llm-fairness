Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  14  54  65  60  73   9  41
1  17  40  37  14  98  19  21  18
2  69  50  61  27  70  23  67  88
3  73  73   8  92  89  20  56  27
4  91  61   8  18  62  22  20  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Since there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more than one item. We'll aim for an allocation that distributes items evenly with a focus on maximizing individual satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (73).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (98).
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (88).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (92).
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (91).

Now, we allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 also values item 3 highly (65) after item 5.
- Agent 1 also values item 1 highly (40) after item 4.
- Agent 2 also values item 6 highly (67) after item 7.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 3
- Agent 1: Items 4, 1
- Agent 2: Items 7, 6
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 0

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
