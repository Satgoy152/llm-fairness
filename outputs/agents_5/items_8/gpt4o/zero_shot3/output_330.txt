Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  89  36  48   1  60  43  14
1  37  67  25   1  15  22  59  45
2  67  79  66  77  65  14  51  26
3  48  57  49  11  59  19  93  75
4  84  15   7  88  40  79  16  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. We can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.

Let's take the following approach:
1. Assign the highest value items to the agent who values them the most.
2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated is 8.
3. Distribute items such that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, balancing the distribution.

Here's a proposed allocation based on these principles:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (value of 89), so we allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly (value of 59), so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly (value of 77), so we allocate item 3 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 highly (value of 93), but it's already allocated, so let's assign item 7 which they value at 75.
- Agent 4 values item 3 highly (value of 88), but it's already allocated, so let's assign item 5 which they value at 79.

Now, allocate remaining items:
- Agent 0 can also receive item 0 which has a high value of 75.
- Agent 2 can also receive item 2 which has a value of 66.
- Agent 4 can also receive item 4 which has a value of 40.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair distribution based on their valuations and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.
