Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  55  71  53  79  88  86  46
1  50  25   5  87  55  64  64  25
2  35  70  61  57  89  81  83  91
3  39  67  31  87  23  12  94  48
4  67   7  38  56  12  20  66  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. One approach to fairness is to try to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that considers the valuations and attempts to distribute the items in a way that seems balanced based on their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (value = 88).
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value = 87).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 7 (value = 91).
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6 (value = 94).
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value = 67).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 4.

Now, we have three items left to allocate (1, 2, 4). We can distribute these remaining items to agents to balance their total valuations.

6. **Distribute remaining items:**

   - Allocate item 1 to agent 3 (highest remaining value = 67).
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0 (highest remaining value = 71).
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 2 (highest remaining value = 89).

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has received a fair share based on their preferences.

Here are the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [6, 1],
    "4": [0]
}
```
