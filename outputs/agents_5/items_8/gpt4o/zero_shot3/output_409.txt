Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  90  63  33  97   5  20  78
1  84  92  34  44   5   4  93  57
2  35  12  26  15  36  12  61  88
3  87  21  99  20   4  31  33  62
4  48  14  98  21  74  70  39  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [48 14 98 21 74 70 39 39]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

One possible allocation strategy is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations for those items, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Select item 4 (value 97)
   - Select item 1 (value 90)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Select item 0 (value 84)
   - Select item 6 (value 93)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Select item 7 (value 88)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Select item 2 (value 99)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Select item 3 (value 21)
   - Select item 5 (value 70)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are fairly distributed based on the valuations provided.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```
