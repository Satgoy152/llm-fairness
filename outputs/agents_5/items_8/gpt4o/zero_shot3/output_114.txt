Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  43   7  35  65  25  87  34
1   3   9  63  26  90  55  64  31
2   7  40   3  10  46  79  22  50
3  66  52  28  57  32  56  67  85
4  43  51  63  85  73  95  89  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of their assigned items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the valuations, we can use a heuristic method to assign items to the agents. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value of each item to all agents and prioritize assigning items based on these values.
2. Assign items to agents where they have relatively higher valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Check that all items are allocated and adjust assignments if needed to ensure fairness and completeness.

Based on the given table, a possible allocation is as follows:

- Assign item 6 to agent 0 (highest valuation for agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (highest valuation for agent 1).
- Assign item 5 to agent 2 (highest valuation for agent 2).
- Assign item 7 to agent 3 (highest valuation for agent 3).
- Assign item 3 and item 2 to agent 4 (agent 4 has high valuations for these items).
- Assign item 1 to agent 4 (agent 4 has high valuation for this item).
- Assign item 0 to agent 4 (agent 4 has high valuation for this item).

After ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 1, 2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
