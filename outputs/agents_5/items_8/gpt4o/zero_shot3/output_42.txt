Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  16  86  73  94  31  63  97
1  84  69  53  53   8  24  70  57
2  60  58  59  93  37  38   1  64
3  42  51  71  51  85  15  87  27
4  82  16  66   6  43  80  91  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize each agent’s satisfaction by giving them the items they value the most. Here’s one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 4 (94) and item 7 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 (84) and item 6 (70).
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 3 (93).
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 5 (15), but since it has a relatively low value, we can assign items where other agents have the least preference.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 6 (91), but since it is already allocated, we can assign items where other agents have the least preference.

Based on the above considerations, the allocation could be as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items 4, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 0, 6
- **Agent 2**: Item 3
- **Agent 3**: Item 2
- **Agent 4**: Items 1, 5

This allocation is designed to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their given preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
