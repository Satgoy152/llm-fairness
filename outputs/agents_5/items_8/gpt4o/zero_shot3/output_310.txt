Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  35  18  89  57  68  34  47
1  46  11  62  85   0  93  12  30
2  90  45  74   0  91  31  76  45
3  85  13  34  79  90   1  21  71
4  16  63  14   2  82  69  53  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an algorithm that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Look for items that have very high valuations for specific agents, as these should ideally be allocated to those agents to maximize overall utility.

2. **Balancing**: Ensure each agent gets a fair share of items, considering both quantity and value.

3. **Optimization**: Try to optimize the allocation so that each agent receives items that they value highly.

Let's walk through the allocation process:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 3 (89) and 0 (76). We can allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Highest value items are 5 (93) and 3 (85). We can allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 0 (90) and 4 (91). We can allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Highest value items are 0 (85) and 4 (90), but item 0 is already taken. We can allocate item 2 (34) to Agent 3 as a compromise.
- **Agent 4**: Highest value items are 7 (96) and 4 (82), but item 4 is already taken. We can allocate item 7 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items by trying to balance and ensure all items are used:

- **Remaining Items**: 0, 1, 6
- **Agent 0**: Allocated item 1 (35).
- **Agent 2**: Allocated item 6 (76).
- **Agent 3**: Allocated item 0 (85).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2, 0],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent as high a satisfaction as possible given their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
