Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  44  67  88  88  27  13  49
1  41  63  32  70  23  83  22  27
2  88  61  82  20   5  30  91  78
3  62  79  97  89   6  42   6  40
4  47  45  75  57  86  82  84   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize overall satisfaction. However, since the problem requires a fair distribution, we must ensure each agent receives an equitable share based on the total number of items (8 items) and agents (5 agents). 

Let's start by considering each agent's highest-valued items and try to allocate items in a way that maximizes fairness. We can iterate over the agents and allocate items by trying to balance the allocations as evenly as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 3 (88), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 5 (83), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 6 (91), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 2 (97), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 4 (86), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, leaving us with three more items (0, 1, and 7) to distribute:

6. Agent 0 could also receive item 0 (29) as it is one of their higher valuations.
7. Agent 1 could receive item 1 (63) to balance their allocation.
8. Agent 4 could receive item 7 (8) to ensure they have a second item.

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items each agent receives while considering their highest-valued preferences.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
