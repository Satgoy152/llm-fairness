Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  46   3  65  68  45  75  79
1  11  69  93  89  21  24  17  79
2   0  18  39   0  61  94  46  29
3   0  73  78  86  18  22  80  14
4  45  98  93  80  68  69  33  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy where each agent gets the items that they value most highly. We'll attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each item is allocated exactly once.

Hereâ€™s one way to fairly allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 6 (75) the most, so assign item 6 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 (93) the most, so assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 (94) the most, so assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 (86) the most, so assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 (98) the most, so assign item 1 to agent 4.

After assigning the items that each agent values the most, we need to allocate the remaining items to have a total of 8 items allocated.

6. Agent 0 can take item 7 (79) as their second choice, as it has a high value for them.
7. Agent 4 can take item 0 (45), which is their next best available option.
8. Agent 3 can take item 4 (18), which is the last remaining unallocated item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.
