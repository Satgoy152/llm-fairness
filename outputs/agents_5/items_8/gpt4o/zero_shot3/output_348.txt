Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44   8  26  41  43  70  12  91
1  65  52  33  52   0  25  57  22
2  82  88  30  35  78  39  23  91
3   0  98  12  91  23  70  51  85
4   7  84  41  73  36  93  12  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Assign each agent one item based on their highest individual valuation to ensure each agent gets at least one item.

2. **Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items by considering the items that offer the greatest increase in total value for the agents.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest value for item 7 (value 91).
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest value for item 0 (value 65).
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest value for item 1 (value 88).
4. **Agent 3**: Has the highest value for item 1, which is already taken, so next highest is item 3 (value 91).
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest value for item 5 (value 93).

Now, we have assigned one item to each agent and have 3 items left to allocate.

6. **Remaining Items**: Items left are: 2, 4, and 6.

   - **Item 2**: Highest unallocated value is by Agent 4 (value 41).
   - **Item 4**: Highest unallocated value is by Agent 2 (value 78).
   - **Item 6**: Highest unallocated value is by Agent 1 (value 57).

After considering the above, let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```

Each agent gets at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated.
