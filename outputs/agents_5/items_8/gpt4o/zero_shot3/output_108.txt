Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  40  33  41  71  43  50  53
1  16  28  72   0  65  28  44  14
2  74  11  39  28  83  34  79   0
3  19  18  81  51   2  44  44  23
4  20  43  20  45  55  76  33  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the preferences and valuations of the items by each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's start by examining the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  40  33  41  71  43  50  53
1  16  28  72   0  65  28  44  14
2  74  11  39  28  83  34  79   0
3  19  18  81  51   2  44  44  23
4  20  43  20  45  55  76  33  82
```

The goal is to allocate the items in a way that maximizes total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent may receive an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

### Proposed Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (84), Item 4 (71)
   - Allocation: Item 0, Item 4

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (72), Item 4 (65)
   - Allocation: Item 2

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (83), Item 6 (79)
   - Allocation: Item 6

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (81), Item 3 (51)
   - Allocation: Item 3

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (82), Item 5 (76)
   - Allocation: Item 1, Item 5, Item 7

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences as much as possible and ensures that all items are allocated. Each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are distributed among them.
