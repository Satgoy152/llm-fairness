Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  90  51  36  34   1  73  68
1  70  45   0  69  19  36  63   8
2   9  11  91   9   5  48  13  49
3  69   4  83  45  33  62   7  87
4  21  32   8  74  79  58  40  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent places on the items, aiming to maximize overall satisfaction. Let's attempt to allocate the items in a way that maximizes total utility while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's one approach to allocating items:

1. Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no item is assigned twice.
2. Reassign remaining items to agents who value them highly, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Based on the valuations provided:

- Agent 0 values items 0 and 1 the highest.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest but it's already taken by Agent 0, so let's consider item 3.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the highest.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest.

Now, let's assign each agent at least one item based on their highest available valuation, and then allocate remaining items:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 90).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 69).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 91).
4. Assign item 7 to Agent 3 (value 87).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (value 79).

Now, 3 items remain: [1, 5, 6]. Let's assign them based on remaining high valuations:

- Agent 0 should also get item 1 (value 90).
- Agent 3 should get item 5 (value 62).
- Agent 1 should get item 6 (value 63).

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7, 5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives items they value relatively highly, balancing the overall utility.
