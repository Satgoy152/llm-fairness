Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  78  76   2  95  39  33  41  91
1  32  50  28  98  23  27  94  85
2  42  85  60  58   9  55  81   0
3  76  90  97  86  30  60  28  55
4  93  48   9  20  31  39  72  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. Let's aim for a balanced distribution where each agent receives approximately one or two items, given there are 8 items and 5 agents.

After reviewing the valuations, here's a suggested allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 7.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 6.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 5.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for items 0 and 7.

Considering these observations, we can distribute the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 3
- Agent 1: Items 6 and 1
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 7

This distribution attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their given valuations. Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7]
}
```
