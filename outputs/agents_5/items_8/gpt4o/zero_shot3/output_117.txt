Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  94  16  58  39   1  30  65
1  70  97  76  44  44  91  72  62
2  37  91  68  96  37  91   6  84
3  81  58  44  63  63  28  51  19
4  83  32  22  20  23  19  68  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to distribute them such that each agent's valuations are considered, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. A common approach is to maximize the total valuation across all agents, but since fairness is subjective, we'll strive for an equitable distribution based on the given valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values items {0, 1} highly.
- Agent 1 values items {1, 5} highly.
- Agent 2 values items {3, 7} highly.
- Agent 3 values item {0} highly.
- Agent 4 can take the remaining items.

Let's allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [3, 7]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [4, 6]

This allocation considers high valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
