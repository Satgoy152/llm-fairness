Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  69  22  73   3  44  40  39
1  42  86  10  50  41  41  22  82
2  62   7  90  93  53  22  78  37
3   5  54  72  72  17  81  87  41
4   8  89  69  62  46  36  99  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents based on their valuations, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction or value for each agent. One common strategy is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible and balancing the total number of items.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation for each item across all agents and assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and redistribute if necessary to achieve this.
3. If some agents receive no items, adjust by reallocating items with the next best value.

Let's allocate the items based on the above strategy:

- Agent 0 values items: 0 (20), 1 (69), 2 (22), 3 (73), 4 (3), 5 (44), 6 (40), 7 (39)
- Agent 1 values items: 0 (42), 1 (86), 2 (10), 3 (50), 4 (41), 5 (41), 6 (22), 7 (82)
- Agent 2 values items: 0 (62), 1 (7), 2 (90), 3 (93), 4 (53), 5 (22), 6 (78), 7 (37)
- Agent 3 values items: 0 (5), 1 (54), 2 (72), 3 (72), 4 (17), 5 (81), 6 (87), 7 (41)
- Agent 4 values items: 0 (8), 1 (89), 2 (69), 3 (62), 4 (46), 5 (36), 6 (99), 7 (45)

Based on these valuations, the allocation can be:

- Item 0 goes to Agent 2 (highest value 62)
- Item 1 goes to Agent 1 (highest value 86)
- Item 2 goes to Agent 2 (highest value 90)
- Item 3 goes to Agent 2 (highest value 93)
- Item 4 goes to Agent 4 (highest value 46)
- Item 5 goes to Agent 3 (highest value 81)
- Item 6 goes to Agent 4 (highest value 99)
- Item 7 goes to Agent 1 (highest value 82)

Now, each agent should get at least 1 item if possible, and we have to ensure a fair distribution:

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [None]
- Agent 1: [1, 7]
- Agent 2: [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [4, 6]

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 2, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
