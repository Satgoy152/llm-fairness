Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  51  27  73  91  81  90  77
1  19  70  98   7  68  74  50  47
2  61  99  75  51  71  71   2  71
3  26  67  67  43  80  57  24  13
4  73  45  82  67  75  95  61  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [19 70 98  7 68 74 50 47]
 [61 99 75 51 71 71  2 71]

 [73 45 82 67 75 95 61 71]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a greedy approach where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This approach ensures that each item is allocated to an agent who finds it most beneficial. Let's assign the items step by step:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (82).
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (99).
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (98).
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (73).
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (91).
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 (95).
7. Item 6: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (90).
8. Item 7: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (77).

However, since Agent 0 is getting too many items, we need to redistribute some of these items to ensure fairness.

Let's adjust the allocation so each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Items 5, 6, 7

This way, each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed in a manner that respects the agents' preferences as much as possible.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
