Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  48  28  79  38  61  61  64
1  43  41  44  94  85  32  77  42
2  38  58  47   4  27   6  54  12
3  43  77  18  72  45   5  84  49
4  24  19  67  37  93  10  22  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by giving each agent the items they value the most, while ensuring that no agent gets more than their fair share of items. Here, each agent can receive up to 2 items since there are 5 agents and 8 items in total.

Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the most (79) and then item 7 (64).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the most (94) and then item 4 (85).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 the most (58) and then item 2 (47).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 the most (84) and then item 1 (77).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 4 the most (93) and then item 2 (67).

We should aim to distribute based on the highest individual values while ensuring all items are assigned without duplication:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value: 94).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (highest value: 93).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (highest value: 84).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (second highest value: 77); this covers Agent 3's allocation.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value: 64).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value: 7); this covers Agent 0's allocation.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (value: 67); this covers Agent 4's allocation.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (second highest value: 32); this covers Agent 1's allocation.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and each agent gets a fair share of the items.
