Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  47  17  73  41  10   2   1
1   6  99  92   9  86  19  53   8
2  89  95  79  49  60  52   5  65
3  64  89  66  46  28   3  28  59
4  31  23  75  48   1  80  14  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's preferences are taken into account as much as possible. One approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items. Below is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 0 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has high values for items 1 and 2.
3. **Agent 2** has high values for items 5 and 7.
4. **Agent 3** has reasonable values for items 4.
5. **Agent 4** has a high value for item 6.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2.

This allocation considers the highest valuations while ensuring all items are distributed fairly among the agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6]
}
```
