Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  32  40  42  22  94  66  70
1  77  47  45  42  29  27  22  49
2  45  47  54  15  81  88  11  97
3  91  37  33  63  74  35  63  15
4  27  15   4  47  75   1  27  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item. Additionally, the allocation should consider maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (94) and item 0 (67).
- Agent 1 highly values item 0 (77) and item 1 (47).
- Agent 2 highly values item 7 (97) and item 5 (88).
- Agent 3 highly values item 0 (91) but it’s already taken, so items 4 (74) and 3 (63) are good options.
- Agent 4 highly values item 7 (94) but it’s already taken, so item 4 (75) is a good option.

Following this logic, we can make the allocations as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 5 and 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 7 and 6.
- Agent 3 gets items 4 and 3.
- Agent 4 gets no items (because all items are allocated).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": []
}
```
