Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  47   2  75  15   7  22  40
1  13  60  34  78  89  51  47  78
2  41   5  37  34  58  77  38  64
3  53  42  47  46  91  34  61  71
4  74  62  41   8   0  92  47  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider an approach that attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each item is allocated. A possible method is to use a "max-min" strategy, which tries to ensure that the minimum satisfaction level among agents is maximized.

One approach is to iteratively allocate the highest valued item for each agent until all items are allocated. Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Agent 0: Highest valued item is 3 (75).
2. Agent 1: Highest valued item is 4 (89).
3. Agent 2: Highest valued item is 5 (77).
4. Agent 3: Highest valued item is 4 (91) - already taken, next is 7 (71).
5. Agent 4: Highest valued item is 5 (92) - already taken, next is 0 (74).

Now, we have allocated the highest value items for each agent, let's deal with the remaining items:

- Items allocated so far: 3, 4, 5, 7, 0 (allocated to agents 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively).
- Remaining items: 1, 2, 6.

For the remaining items, we'll allocate based on the next highest value that hasn't yet been allocated:

- Agent 0: Next highest value not allocated is 1 (47).
- Agent 2: Next highest value not allocated is 2 (37).
- Agent 3: Next highest value not allocated is 6 (61).

Thus, we finalize the allocation as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [7, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and attempts to balance the distribution based on the agents' valuations.
