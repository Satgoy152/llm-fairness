Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  29  34  80   8  67  80  49
1  41   3  77  32  86  27  82  25
2  47  81  67  55  27  39  52  18
3  92  13  15  76  82  12  26  83
4  34  59  31  16  98  19  93  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy approach to maximize the total valuation for each agent. The goal is to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here's a proposed allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuations while ensuring a fair distribution:
   - Agent 0 has high values for items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 1 has high values for item 4.
   - Agent 2 has high values for item 1.
   - Agent 3 has high values for item 7.
   - Agent 4 has high values for items 5 and 6.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2: Agent 1 has the next highest value.
- Reassign if necessary to ensure fairness and optimal distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to an agent, and the total number of items allocated is 8. The agents receive items based on their highest valuations, aiming for a fair distribution.
