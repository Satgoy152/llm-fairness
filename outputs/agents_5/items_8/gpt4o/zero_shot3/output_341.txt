Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  49  32  11  66  78  13  28  92
1  20  79  43  23  56  73   3  52
2  53  62  30  92  22   9  65  54
3  19  69  19  77  43  97  50  38
4  49   5  16  51  49  13  66  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[49 32 11 66 78 13 28 92]
 [20 79 43 23 56 73  3 52]
 [53 62 30 92 22  9 65 54]
 [19 69 19 77 43 97 50 38]
 [49  5 16 51 49 13 66 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Receives items 0 and 7 for a total valuation of 49 + 92 = 141.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Receives items 1 and 5 for a total valuation of 79 + 73 = 152.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Receives items 3 and 6 for a total valuation of 92 + 65 = 157.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Receives item 4 for a total valuation of 43.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Receives item 2 for a total valuation of 16.

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed, and each agent has at least one item. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
