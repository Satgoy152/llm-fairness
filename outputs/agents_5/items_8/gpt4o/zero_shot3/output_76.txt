Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  76  44  52   0  22  83  68  32
1  53   5  73  26  60  82   1  23
2  18  19  96  17   5  56  70  49
3  55  54  71  42  64  76  22  39
4  48  25  10  80  68  23  46  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [48 25 10 80 68 23 46 50]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's valuation is maximized while also ensuring a fair distribution. We will use a balancing approach to distribute the items, given that each agent should receive as close to an equal share of the total value as possible.

Let's calculate each agent's total valuation for all items:

- Agent 0: 76 + 44 + 52 + 0 + 22 + 83 + 68 + 32 = 377
- Agent 1: 53 + 5 + 73 + 26 + 60 + 82 + 1 + 23 = 323
- Agent 2: 18 + 19 + 96 + 17 + 5 + 56 + 70 + 49 = 330
- Agent 3: 55 + 54 + 71 + 42 + 64 + 76 + 22 + 39 = 423
- Agent 4: 48 + 25 + 10 + 80 + 68 + 23 + 46 + 50 = 350

Now, we will try to allocate the items:

1. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value (96).
2. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0, as it has a high value (83).
3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 4, as it has a high value (80).
4. Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it has a value of 44, which is higher than for other agents.
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1, as it has a value of 60.
6. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3, as it has a value of 55, which is higher than for other agents.
7. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2, as it has the highest value (70).
8. Allocate item 7 to Agent 4, as it has a value of 50.

The allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 3: Item [0]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 7]

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and the total number of items is eight, as required.
