Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  92  33  21  64  72  40  74
1  59  22   0   7   4  29   2  91
2  31  61  41  18  54  58  44  45
3  50  31  98  61   6  67   8  33
4  34  85  94  41  77  71  58  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We will consider each agent's valuation of the items to distribute them in a way that each agent receives items they value highly. 

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 0 and 1 highly. Giving them these items maximizes their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 7 the highest. Assigning item 7 to Agent 1 maximizes their satisfaction.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 highly, so assigning item 5 to Agent 2 is beneficial for their satisfaction.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 2 highly, so assigning item 2 to Agent 3 maximizes their satisfaction.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values items 4, 6, and 3 quite highly. Assigning these items to Agent 4 is beneficial.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is equal to 8.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets items they value highly.
