Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  13  62  26  80  61  96  23
1  76  48  80  59  92  25  41  98
2  62  73  10   7  70   8  22  73
3  48  26  68  72   5  23  78  18
4  10  60  75  20  69  69  94  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives items that maximize their total value, ensuring that all items are allocated and no agent receives more than their fair share.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (99), Item 6 (96), Item 4 (80)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (98), Item 4 (92), Item 2 (80)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (73), Item 7 (73), Item 4 (70)
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (78), Item 3 (72), Item 2 (68)
   
5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (94), Item 2 (75), Item 5 (69)

Let's allocate based on these preferences while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are assigned.

### Allocation Process:
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2 (since Agent 0 already got Item 0).
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 4.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 4 (since they value it equally with Item 2).
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 3 (since Agent 4 already has Items 2 and 5).
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items (0 through 7) are distributed among the agents, and each agent gets an integer number of items.
