Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  66  44  47  43  89  15   7
1  13  23  95  71  42  17   4  82
2  42   7  97  23  92  86  83  93
3  67  99  44  35  30  71  30  32
4  58  84  53  61  43   0  18   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to try and maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so let's give item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most, so let's give item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most, but it is already allocated, so let's give item 7 to agent 2, which is their next highest value.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most, so let's give item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most, but it is already allocated, so let's give item 3 to agent 4, which is their next highest value.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 4, 5, and 6.

6. Agent 2 values item 5 the second highest, so let's give item 5 to agent 2.
7. Agent 2 also values item 6 highly, so let's give item 6 to agent 2.
8. Finally, let's give item 4 to agent 1 as they have a reasonable valuation for it.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair chance at having items based on their preference.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 6, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
