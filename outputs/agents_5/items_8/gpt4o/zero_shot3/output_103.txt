Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  34  92  64  13  53  40  79
1  46  87  63  66  55  19  85   3
2  13  69  60  17  59  91   1  21
3  86  11  72  46  65  49  12   6
4  84  92  19  91  71  10  58  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm, which assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Given that we have 5 agents and 8 items, we can aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets at least one item, and then allocate the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here's one way to achieve this allocation:

1. Each agent must receive at least one item. Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most.

2. After the initial allocation, assign the remaining items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that every item is assigned and no agent receives more items than the number of items available (8 items in total).

Following this approach, here is one possible allocation of the 8 items to the 5 agents:

- **Agent 0**: Start by assigning item 2 (value 92), the highest value for agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (value 87), the highest value for agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 (value 91), the highest value for agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 0 (value 86), the highest value for agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 3 (value 91), the highest value for agent 4.

This covers 5 items. Now, allocate the remaining 3 items:

- **Item 4**: Assign to agent 4 (value 71, next highest for agent 4).
- **Item 6**: Assign to agent 1 (value 85, next highest for agent 1).
- **Item 7**: Assign to agent 0 (value 79, next highest for agent 0).

The allocations can be represented in the required JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, optimizing for the high valuations where possible.
