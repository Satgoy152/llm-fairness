Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  64  76   2   0  12  20  27
1  19  12   7  65  86  37  26  19
2  68  90  14  37  32  12  39  10
3  23  98  41  78  92  70  72  96
4  64  62   8  34  79  99  42  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations while ensuring that every agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Allocate the items that Agent 0 values highly. Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 76 and item 1 at 64. Allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Allocate the items that Agent 1 values highly. Agent 1 values item 4 the most at 86 and item 3 at 65. Allocate these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Allocate the items that Agent 2 values highly. Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 90. Since item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0, allocate item 0 to Agent 2, which Agent 2 values at 68, and item 6, valued at 39.
4. **Agent 3:** Allocate the items that Agent 3 values highly. Agent 3 values item 7 at 96. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Allocate the remaining items. Agent 4 values item 5 the most at 99. Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, and all items are distributed. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5]
}
``` 

This allocation uses all 8 items and considers the preferences of each agent.
