Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  42  10  29  83  79  28  59
1  57   1  39  55  89  72  75  19
2  68  91  55  44  80  18  13  36
3  25  69  69  92  83  22  97  32
4  73  30  17  12  79  61  75  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. The goal is to have a balanced distribution that respects the preferences of the agents as much as possible.

Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 0 the most (98). Let's allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 4 the most (89). Let's allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 1 the most (91). Let's allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 6 the most (97). Let's allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 0 the most (73), but it's already taken. The next highest value is for item 4 (79), but it's also taken. Let's allocate item 7 (49) to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated five items, and three remain. We need to allocate items 2, 3, and 5.

6. **Item 2**: The highest remaining value for item 2 is with agent 3 (69). Let's allocate item 2 to agent 3.
7. **Item 3**: The highest remaining value for item 3 is with agent 3 (92). Let's allocate item 3 to agent 3.
8. **Item 5**: The highest remaining value for item 5 is with agent 0 (79). Let's allocate item 5 to agent 0.

The allocation is complete, with each agent receiving at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
