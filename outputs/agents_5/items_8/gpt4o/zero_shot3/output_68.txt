Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  83  54  16  23  37  92  97
1  94  59  25  91  47  88  36   9
2  78   5  94  88  89  64  76  64
3  26  51  60  11  46  27   7  20
4  24  15   8  33  92  75  68  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [94 59 25 91 47 88 36  9]
 [78  5 94 88 89 64 76 64]

 [24 15  8 33 92 75 68 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [60, 83, 54, 16, 23, 37, 92, 97]
   - Highest value item: Item 7 (97)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [94, 59, 25, 91, 47, 88, 36, 9]
   - Highest value item: Item 0 (94)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [78, 5, 94, 88, 89, 64, 76, 64]
   - Highest value item: Item 2 (94)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [26, 51, 60, 11, 46, 27, 7, 20]
   - Highest value item: Item 6 (7)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Values: [24, 15, 8, 33, 92, 75, 68, 74]
   - Highest value item: Item 4 (92)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 1: Allocate to Agent 0 (second highest value is 83).
- Item 3: Allocate to Agent 1 (second highest value is 91).
- Item 5: Allocate to Agent 2 (second highest value is 64).

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.
