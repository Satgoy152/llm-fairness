Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  68  78  45  16  74  80  83
1  91  11  94  27  97  86  27  30
2  43  56  52  46  76  19  57  93
3  58  15  13  34   6  29  43  96
4  47  56  26  74  94  12  71  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's valuation of their allocated items is as fair as possible. Given the constraints, each agent should receive at least one item and we need to distribute all 8 items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items 0, 6, and 7 highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 2 and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 7.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 7 the highest.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers items 4 and 3.

A possible fair allocation considering these preferences could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1] (values: 96, 68)
- **Agent 1**: Items [4, 5] (values: 97, 86)
- **Agent 2**: Items [2] (value: 52)
- **Agent 3**: Items [6] (value: 43)
- **Agent 4**: Items [3, 7] (values: 74, 37)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and distributes all items according to the preferences shown in the valuation table.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```
