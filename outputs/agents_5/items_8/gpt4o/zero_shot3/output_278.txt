Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  16  35  38  37  16  52  52
1  98  71  25  71  56  98  79   5
2  81  24  35  65  98  42  88  75
3   6  34  55   5  83  31  18  41
4   3  34  14  79  88  41  56  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we need to consider the valuations of the agents for the items and aim for a balanced distribution. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction (value) of each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. 

Let's follow a strategic approach to allocation:

1. **Agent Preferences:**
   - Agent 0 values item 6 and 7 highly.
   - Agent 1 values item 0 and 5 highly.
   - Agent 2 values item 4, 6, and 7 highly.
   - Agent 3 values item 4 highly.
   - Agent 4 values item 4 and 3 highly.

2. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Assign the highest valued items to agents who value them the most.
   - Avoid assigning multiple items to a single agent unless necessary.

3. **Adjusting for Fairness:**
   - Ensure each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is as balanced as possible.

**Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Assign items [6, 7] because these are the highest-value items for Agent 0.
- Agent 1: Assign items [0, 5] because these are the highest-value items for Agent 1.
- Agent 2: Assign items [4] because it's highly valued and ensures a fair distribution.
- Agent 3: Assign items [3] because item 3 is not highly valued by others and this ensures agent 3 gets an item.
- Agent 4: Assign items [1, 2] because they have a moderate value for Agent 4, ensuring all items are allocated.

**Final Allocation in JSON:**

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive at least one item, all items are allocated, and the distribution is as fair as possible based on the given valuations.
