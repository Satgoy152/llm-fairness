Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  23  88  98  57  18  19  12
1  44  15  27  35  37  24  47  42
2  11   5  44  93  84  16  95  30
3  97  67  96  59  25  57  97  52
4  68  23  75  14  95   0   1  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Additionally, each agent should receive a roughly equal number of items. Here is one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 has relatively lower valuations, so they might receive items that are less valued by others but still maximize their own value.
- Agent 2 has high valuation for item 6.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 6.
- Agent 4 has high valuation for item 4.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction and distribution fairness:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 3. 
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent has received a fair valuation based on their preferences, while also distributing the number of items approximately evenly among the agents.

Here is the JSON formatted allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and agents receive a fair share based on their valuations.
