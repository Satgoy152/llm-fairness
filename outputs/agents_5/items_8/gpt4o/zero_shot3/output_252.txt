Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  17  99  26  12  66  27  16  41
1  42  49  76  28  66  87  44  98
2  60  33  92  22  44  27  31  60
3  52  37  62  48  45  75  93   3
4  17  94  48  61  65  57  63  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we strive to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are distributed. Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value item for Agent 0 is item 1 (value 99).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value item for Agent 1 is item 7 (value 98).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value item for Agent 2 is item 2 (value 92).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value item for Agent 3 is item 6 (value 93).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value item for Agent 4 is item 1, but it's taken. Second highest is item 0 (value 17).

Then, we allocate the remaining items by evaluating the next highest value:

Agent 0: Item 4 (value 66)  
Agent 1: Item 5 (value 87)  
Agent 2: Item 0 (value 60)  
Agent 3: Item 3 (value 48)  
Agent 4: Item 7 (value 59)  

Finally, we ensure each agent has items and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [7, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items based on their highest valuation, and all items are distributed.
