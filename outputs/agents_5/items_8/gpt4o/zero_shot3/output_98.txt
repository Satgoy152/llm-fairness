Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  20  79  22  65  57  71  47
1  74  67  73  54   6  22  22  47
2  11  45  82  31  56  83  45  77
3  20  90  30  60  74  61  52  33
4  71  24  22  26  10   0  13  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them such that each agent receives some items, and the total valuations are distributed reasonably equitably among them. Let's try to distribute based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (79), Item 6 (71)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (74), Item 2 (73)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (83), Item 2 (82)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (90), Item 4 (74)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (96), Item 0 (71)

Let's allocate based on these preferences, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 6
- **Agent 1**: Item 0
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 1
- **Agent 4**: Items 7, 3, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and utilizes the highest valuations per preference, trying to balance out the total value each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7, 3, 4]
}
```
