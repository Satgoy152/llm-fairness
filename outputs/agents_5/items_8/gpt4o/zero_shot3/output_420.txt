Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  61  29  90  98  27   8  48
1  57  92  86  31  27  15  62  40
2  68  73  49  37  79  50  85  28
3   0  96  22  28  63  71  79  48
4   4  73  50   4  78  79  92  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction. A common approach to this problem is to use a method like the Hungarian algorithm or a heuristic approach to find a fair distribution. However, given the constraints and the need for an approximate solution, I will provide a heuristic-based allocation that attempts to balance the total values each agent receives.

Let's proceed with a heuristic allocation by considering the highest valuations for each item:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation by agent 2 (68).
2. Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 3 (96).
3. Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 1 (86).
4. Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 0 (90).
5. Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 0 (98).
6. Item 5: Highest valuation by agent 4 (79).
7. Item 6: Highest valuation by agent 4 (92).
8. Item 7: Highest valuation by agent 4 (97).

Now, let's allocate the items to ensure each agent receives a fair share:

- Agent 0: [3, 4]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [5, 6, 7]

Here's the JSON output of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair amount based on their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
