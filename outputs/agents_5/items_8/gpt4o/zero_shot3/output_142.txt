Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  25   9  29  35   7  64   2
1  75  22  26  78  14  88  16  86
2  56  59  57  99  19   5  54  52
3  70  32  26  28  32  58  34   6
4  99  53  48  26  90  60  69  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[80 25  9 29 35  7 64  2]
 [75 22 26 78 14 88 16 86]
 [56 59 57 99 19  5 54 52]
 [70 32 26 28 32 58 34  6]
 [99 53 48 26 90 60 69 40]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 0 (value 80)

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 1 (value 22)
   - Item 6 (value 16)
   - Item 7 (value 86)

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 3 (value 99)

4. Agent 3:
   - Item 5 (value 58)

5. Agent 4:
   - Item 2 (value 48)
   - Item 4 (value 90)

This allocation considers the high-value items for each agent and ensures that all 8 items are distributed.

Now, here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 6, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
