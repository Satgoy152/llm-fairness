Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  15  96   9   0  47  99  55
1  55  29  79  46  59  20  45  47
2  66  26  32  74  63  74  85  80
3  65  48  28  18  59  57  41  74
4  70  96  21  17  15  59  97  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are allocated. A simple approach is to allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this:

1. **Initialize**: Start with an empty allocation for each agent.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
   - Assign the item to that agent.

3. **Ensure Fairness**:
   - Make sure no agent gets all the items or none at all unless it's unavoidable due to the number of agents and items.
   - Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure each agent gets at least one item. Given there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will get more items than others.

Here is how the allocation of items could look:

1. **Item 0**: Most valued by Agent 0 (value 84).
2. **Item 1**: Most valued by Agent 4 (value 96).
3. **Item 2**: Most valued by Agent 0 (value 96).
4. **Item 3**: Most valued by Agent 2 (value 74).
5. **Item 4**: Most valued by Agent 2 (value 63).
6. **Item 5**: Most valued by Agent 2 (value 74).
7. **Item 6**: Most valued by Agent 4 (value 97).
8. **Item 7**: Most valued by Agent 2 (value 80).

Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1: Item 3.
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5, and 7.
- Agent 3: Item 1.
- Agent 4: Item 6.

Now, let's format the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.
