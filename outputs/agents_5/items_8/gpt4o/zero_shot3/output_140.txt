Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  74  69  36  11  90  28  36
1  70  77  58  64  65  71   4  22
2  78  70  23  59  60  27  94  84
3  14  47  73  31  63  31  34  69
4  14  60  22   8  16  87  92  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. One simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. Identify the highest-valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents by giving preference to agents with the highest valuation for a particular item.
3. Ensure each agent gets an item by making adjustments if necessary.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 6 and 7.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 2.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints and fairly distributes the items based on the agents' valuations.
