Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  64  50  91  84  39   1  19
1   8  90  79  58   7  36  76   2
2   6  50  74  12  97  21  80  24
3  20  52  71   5  37  61   4  35
4  44  54  99  65  54  97  87  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's overall satisfaction based on their valuations for the items. We'll use a simple greedy approach to allocate the items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items.

First, let's assign the items based on the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 63.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 90.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it at 99.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 91.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it at 97.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 values it at 97.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it at 80.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it at 35.

Now let's balance the allocation such that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and ensure all 8 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 4, 6
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Items 2, 5

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```
