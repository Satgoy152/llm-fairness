Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  12  35  17  91  59  39  36
1  12  14  45  18  69  41  22  47
2  63  13  30  87  83  31   5   0
3  13  70  34  56  99  57  82  64
4   6   4  46   7  25  11  56   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 6  4 46  7 25 11 56  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation across all agents. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most at 63. Assign to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most at 70. Assign to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 35. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it the most at 87. Assign to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most at 99. Assign to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 59. Assign to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most at 82. Assign to Agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it the most at 47. Assign to Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0 has items: [2, 5]
- Agent 1 has items: [7]
- Agent 2 has items: [0, 3]
- Agent 3 has items: [1, 4, 6]
- Agent 4 has items: []

Adjustments:
- Since Agent 4 has no items, we can consider giving an item with lesser value impact to Agent 4. Let's give Item 5 to Agent 4, which was less valuable to Agent 0 than other items.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [0, 3]
- Agent 3: [1, 4, 6]
- Agent 4: [5]

Here is the JSON representation of the final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1, 4, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```
