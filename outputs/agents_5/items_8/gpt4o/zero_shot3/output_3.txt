Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  35  97  80  53  14  61  30
1   9   2  42  91  26  49  72  22
2  16  13   1  22  61  73  45  93
3  99  85   4  51  90  83  75  30
4  10   2  67  10   7  62  67  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[24 35 97 80 53 14 61 30]
 [ 9  2 42 91 26 49 72 22]
 [16 13  1 22 61 73 45 93]
 [99 85  4 51 90 83 75 30]
 [10  2 67 10  7 62 67 98]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a heuristic approach that considers the values each agent assigns to the items. One reasonable method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 99.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most at 85.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 91.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most at 90.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most at 73.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 72.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it the most at 98.

Now, let's ensure every agent gets at least one item by making minor adjustments:

- Agent 0: Currently has item 2.
- Agent 1: Currently has items 3 and 6.
- Agent 2: Currently has item 5.
- Agent 3: Currently has items 0, 1, and 4.
- Agent 4: Currently has item 7.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 8.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1, 4],
    "4": [7]
}
```
