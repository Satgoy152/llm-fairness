Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  39  41  91  40  32   9  45
1  74  87  97  28  49   5  77   7
2  11  18  74  74  81   7  59  54
3  16  11  40  46  46  78  94  55
4   8  52  36  60  60  27  11  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuation of each item while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items. The goal is to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the highest if possible. 
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Distribute the remaining items by looking at the next highest values.

Let's proceed with a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0: Highest value is for item 3 (value 91).
- Agent 1: Highest value is for item 2 (value 97).
- Agent 2: Highest value is for item 4 (value 81).
- Agent 3: Highest value is for item 6 (value 94).
- Agent 4: Highest value is for item 1 (value 52).

Now, we need to make sure every item is assigned and agents are satisfied:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 4.

Remaining items are: 0, 5, 7.

- Agent 1 values item 0 with a 74, which is their second-highest after item 2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 3 values item 5 with a 78, which is their second-highest after item 6. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- For item 7, both Agent 2 and Agent 3 have relatively high values, but Agent 3 has already received two items. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 since they have a value of 54 for it, which is relatively high for them.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and items are allocated fairly based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [6, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
