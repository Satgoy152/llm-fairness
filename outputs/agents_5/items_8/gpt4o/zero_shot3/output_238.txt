Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  44   7  36  93  41  83  28
1  34   7  89  67   4  61  32  95
2  42  52  95  18  14  19  70  66
3  16  82  49  49   1   1  85  98
4   3  63  66  71  92  37  32  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest value items: 4 (93), 6 (83)
   - Allocate item 4 (93) to Agent 0 for maximum value.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 7 (95), 2 (89)
   - Allocate item 7 (95) to Agent 1 for maximum value.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 2 (95), 6 (70)
   - Allocate item 2 (95) to Agent 2 for maximum value.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value items: 7 (98), 6 (85)
   - Allocate item 6 (85) to Agent 3 for high value.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest value items: 4 (92), 3 (71)
   - Allocate item 3 (71) to Agent 4 for a fairly high value.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 3 more items.

6. **Re-evaluate remaining items:**
   - Items left: 0, 1, 5
   - Agent 0: Highest remaining value is item 5 (41)
   - Agent 3: Highest remaining value is item 7 (98), already allocated, then item 1 (82)
   - Agent 4: Highest remaining value is item 1 (63)

Allocate remaining items to balance the distribution:

- Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (41).
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (16).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 4 (63).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 8 items are allocated. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 0],
    "4": [3, 1]
}
```
