Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  80  59  25  32  75   1  20  18
1  13  26  56  95  80  68  68  91
2  44  27  32  64  30  49  34   8
3   5  14   5  18  65  23  23  11
4  50  37  62  25  89  74   9  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we want to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each gets at least one item, if possible. Let's follow a process to distribute the items:

1. **Identify Highest Value for Each Item**: We will start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Allocate Items**: Follow the valuations and assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

The allocations based on the highest valuations for each item are as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 80.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the highest at 59.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the highest at 62.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the highest at 95.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the highest at 89.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the highest at 74.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the highest at 68.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the highest at 91.

3. **Review and Adjust**: Ensure that each agent has been fairly considered and adjust if necessary to ensure all agents have a fair share, specifically if any agent is left without items.

Here's the final allocation in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation respects the highest valuations per item while ensuring the total number of items allocated is 8.
