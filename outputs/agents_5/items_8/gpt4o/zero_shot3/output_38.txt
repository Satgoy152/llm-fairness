Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  28  72  70  24  96  77  32
1  74  17  42  44  99  20   2  49
2  53  51  75  89  35  72  23  32
3   0  38  35  41  63  50  32   6
4  88  74  12  94  24  23  49   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.
2. Once each agent has at least one item, continue assigning the remaining items based on maximizing the valuation for each agent.

Let's go through the items one by one:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most at 88.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most at 74.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 72.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most at 94.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most at 77.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most at 49.

Ensuring each agent gets at least one item, we can adjust the allocation as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 4, 7
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 0, 1

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent has at least one item. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
