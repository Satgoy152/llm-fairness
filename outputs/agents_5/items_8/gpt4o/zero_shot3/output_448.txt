Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26   9  11  90  73   9  21  97
1  49  87   7  41  91  38  31  90
2  61  71  93  31  87  16  87  38
3  98  59  80   5  11  83  42  68
4   4  34  66  22  18  40   6   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 3 and 7 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 1, 4, and 7 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 2, 4, and 6 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest, along with item 5.
- Agent 4 has relatively low valuations compared to others but values item 5 the highest among their options.

Given these observations, we can try to allocate the items to maximize satisfaction:

1. Agent 0 gets items 3 and 7.
2. Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.
3. Agent 2 gets items 2 and 6.
4. Agent 3 gets item 0.
5. Agent 4 gets item 5.

Now, let's present this in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their high valuations, and all 8 items are allocated fairly among the agents.
