Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  67  23  83  18   9  89  99
1  46  82  18  19  88   7  23  43
2  34  49  11  13  43  49  14  72
3  51  15  64  50  55  87  83  74
4  23  67  68   5   3  44  29  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. A common approach is to consider each agent's highest valued items and distribute them accordingly.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 7 (99), Item 6 (89)
   - Allocation: [7, 6]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (88), Item 1 (82)
   - Allocation: [4, 1]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 7 (72), Item 5 (49)
   - Allocation: [5]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (87), Item 6 (83), Item 3 (50)
   - Allocation: [3]

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (68), Item 0 (67)
   - Allocation: [0, 2]

We ensure that each item is assigned once and that all agents have an opportunity to receive items based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
