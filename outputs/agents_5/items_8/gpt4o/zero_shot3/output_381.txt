Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  87  69  41  32  24  78  46  46
1  56  37  67  49  52  60  10  26
2  21  95  24  42  32  98  31  90
3  58   9  68  44  19  70  89  78
4  61  65  92  10  10  53  41  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item and try to distribute the items in a way that balances the total valuation received by each agent. We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, with consideration for balancing the number of items each agent receives.
2. If conflicts arise (e.g., multiple agents value the highest for different items but end up with an unequal number of items), adjust to balance the distribution.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it highest (87).
- **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it highest (95).
- **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it highest (92).
- **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it highest (42).
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it highest (52).
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it highest (98).
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it highest (89).
- **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it highest (46).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets a fair number of items:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 7.
- **Agent 1**: Item 4.
- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 3, and 5.
- **Agent 3**: Item 6.
- **Agent 4**: Item 2.

This allocation gives us a balanced distribution and maximizes the total valuation for each agent. Each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```
