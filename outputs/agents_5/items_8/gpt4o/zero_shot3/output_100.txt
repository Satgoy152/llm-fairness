Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  75  19  38  34  99  11  29
1  77  47  37  11  10  60  59  27
2  42   1  33  73  70  15  64  18
3  10  64  18  92  26  31  26  29
4  85  25  62  96  64  38  92  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Given that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all 8 items must be allocated, we can follow a strategic approach to ensure fairness. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Determine the highest valued items for each agent and try to allocate them accordingly.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Balance the allocation by considering the total value each agent receives.

Here's a feasible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5, as those are high-value items for them.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 6.
- Agent 2 receives item 3.
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 7.
- Agent 4 receives item 4.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```
