Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  69  77  77  54  82  40  88
1  17  14  84  86  30  47  34  79
2  34  65  39  95   2  81   2  65
3  41  77  72  87   5  14  18   7
4  52  20  49  87  38  89  85  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple rule-based method. In this case, we'll consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share. We will prioritize assigning each agent their most valuable items and ensure that all 8 items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each agent.
2. Allocate the most valued items first.
3. Reallocate remaining items ensuring each agent gets a fair distribution.

Allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 7 (value: 88)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (value: 86)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (value: 95, already taken by Agent 1, next highest: Item 5, value: 81)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value: 87, already taken by Agent 1, next highest: Item 1, value: 77)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (value: 89, already taken by Agent 2, next highest: Item 6, value: 85)

Now, reallocate to ensure all items are distributed:

1. Agent 0: Items 1, 2
2. Agent 1: Item 4
3. Agent 2: Item 0
4. Agent 3: Item 7
5. Agent 4: Item 6

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This ensures that all 8 items are allocated fairly based on the given valuations.
