Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  91  29  59  56  50  66  43
1  92  65  74  38  33  94  62  11
2  68  38  53  98  47  24  49  13
3  14  83  37  99   4  25  16  59
4   0  88   5  47  77  33  50  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item where possible, as well as ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible.

2. If an agent already has an item, consider the second-highest valuation for remaining items, and so on.

Following this approach:

- Item 0: Highest value to Agent 1 (92)
- Item 1: Highest value to Agent 0 (91)
- Item 2: Highest value to Agent 1 (74)
- Item 3: Highest value to Agent 3 (99)
- Item 4: Highest value to Agent 4 (77)
- Item 5: Highest value to Agent 1 (94)
- Item 6: Highest value to Agent 0 (66)
- Item 7: Highest value to Agent 3 (59)

Now, let's check if all agents have at least one item where possible:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2, 5
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7
- Agent 4: Item 4

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, and attempts to maximize the total value for each agent. Here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```
