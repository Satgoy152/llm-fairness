Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  60  56  35  95  92  64  48
1  89  19  84  26  55  61   1  41
2  46  78  75  77  85  56   8  89
3  48  74  19  16  21  12  21  42
4  48  27  91  50  97   6  69  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one approach is to consider maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations, ensuring each agent ends up with an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's proceed to allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuation for item 4 (95) and item 5 (92). We allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Next highest valuation is for item 0 (89). We allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 7 (89). We allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (74). We allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (97), but it is already allocated so we allocate item 2 (91) to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 6 items: items 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7. We need to allocate 2 more items: 3 and 6.

6. **Agent 0**: Item 3 has a valuation of 35, which is the highest available for unallocated items.
7. **Agent 4**: Item 6 has a valuation of 69, which is the highest available for unallocated items.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
