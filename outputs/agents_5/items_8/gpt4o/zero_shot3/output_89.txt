Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  30  87  29  14  41  31  42
1  43  11   4  26  13  39  57  93
2  78  58  31  45  24  51  82  89
3  89   1  36  43  75   7  32  88
4  40  23  35  70  74  58  86  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [43 11  4 26 13 39 57 93]
 [78 58 31 45 24 51 82 89]
 [89  1 36 43 75  7 32 88]
 [40 23 35 70 74 58 86 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that considers maximizing the total valuation each agent receives. This approach aims to give each agent items that they value highly, ensuring a more balanced and fair allocation. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest valuations for each item among all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.
3. If a tie occurs (multiple agents value an item equally), use a simple rule like assigning the item to the agent with the lowest number or any other fair resolution.

Based on this strategy, here's a possible allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 (valuation 89)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (valuation 30)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (valuation 87)
- Item 3: Agent 4 (valuation 70)
- Item 4: Agent 3 (valuation 75)
- Item 5: Agent 4 (valuation 58)
- Item 6: Agent 4 (valuation 86)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (valuation 93)

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [3, 5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 8 items are allocated.
