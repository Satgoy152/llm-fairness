Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  58  91  57  84  14  67  37
1  22  16  81  23  71  47   5  53
2  81   1   7  55  23   0  65  95
3  84   7   7  43   4  13  62  72
4  81  54  89   6  40  50  55  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items. We can use a simple heuristic approach, such as allocating each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Determine the agent who values each item the most.
2. Allocate items to those agents.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item. If an agent receives no items, shift an item from an agent with multiple items to them.

Following this approach:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (84).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (58).
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (91).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (57).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (84).
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most (50).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (67).
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (95).

After this initial allocation, agent 0 has been assigned all items except for items 5 and 7, which is not fair. We need to reallocate to ensure each agent has at least one item.

Reallocating to ensure fairness:

- Assign item 0 to agent 3.
- Assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to agent 4.
- Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to agent 4.
- Assign item 6 to agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to agent 2.

Now, each agent should have at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 4, 7
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Items 2, 5

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and all 8 items are distributed.
