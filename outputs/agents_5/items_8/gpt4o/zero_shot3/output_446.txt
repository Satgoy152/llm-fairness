Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22   9  61  65  59  68  25  37
1   8  92  85  20  41   5  95  46
2  35  22  13  66  14  97   1  84
3  23  63  38  16  50  38  43   0
4   2   0  18  43  25  57  48  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and the total allocation sums up to 8 items. A strategy could be to allocate items based on the maximum value each agent places on them, ensuring that each agent's allocation is as valuable as possible to them while distributing the items fairly. Let's proceed with this approach:

First, we'll identify the highest-valued items for each agent and allocate them accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (68), Item 3 (65)
   - Allocate: Items [3, 5]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (95), Item 1 (92)
   - Allocate: Items [1, 6]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (97), Item 7 (84)
   - Allocate: Items [7]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (63), Item 4 (50)
   - Allocate: Item [4]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest values: Item 7 (70), Item 5 (57)
   - Allocate: Item [0, 2]

Now, we need to check the total number of items allocated and adjust accordingly to ensure exactly 8 items are distributed:

- Agent 0: 2 items
- Agent 1: 2 items
- Agent 2: 1 item
- Agent 3: 1 item
- Agent 4: 2 items

This sums up to 8 items in total, which satisfies the condition. Let's present the final allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
