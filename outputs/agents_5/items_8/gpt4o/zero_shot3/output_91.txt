Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  65  12   0  79  22  47  33
1  16  50  93  88  83  12  94  37
2  86  72  78  97  61  45   3  40
3  87  61  68  32  80  66  50   3
4  75   2  83   8  42  56  77  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0:
   - Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 4 (79) and 1 (65).
2. Agent 1:
   - Agent 1 has a very high valuation for item 2 (93) and item 6 (94).
3. Agent 2:
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 (97) and 0 (86).
4. Agent 3:
   - Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5 (66).
5. Agent 4:
   - Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 7 (61).

By assigning items in this manner, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations given:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents and each agent gets at least one item, maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent.
