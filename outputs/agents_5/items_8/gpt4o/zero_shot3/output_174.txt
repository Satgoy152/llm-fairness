Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  74  59  61  86  39  40  83
1  45  67  67  62   2  41  84  93
2  95  46  45  73  38  97  79  95
3  75   8  42  40  77  28  98  83
4  12  27  77  44  80  58  89  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total satisfaction of all agents. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations. Each item will be assigned to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets Items:** Since there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will get more than one item. We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Adjust for Fair Distribution:** If any agent ends up with no items, adjust the allocation by transferring items from agents with multiple items to those with none, considering the next highest valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0:** Highest value is 97 by Agent 0
- **Item 1:** Highest value is 74 by Agent 0 (Agent 2 has 46 as next highest)
- **Item 2:** Highest value is 77 by Agent 4
- **Item 3:** Highest value is 73 by Agent 2
- **Item 4:** Highest value is 86 by Agent 0
- **Item 5:** Highest value is 97 by Agent 2
- **Item 6:** Highest value is 98 by Agent 3
- **Item 7:** Highest value is 95 by Agent 2 (Agent 0 has 83 as next highest)

After assigning based on highest valuations, we have:

- Agent 0: [0, 1, 4]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [3, 5, 7]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [2]

Agent 1 has no items. We can adjust the allocation by moving item 1 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 since Agent 1 has the second highest valuation for item 1.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [3, 5, 7]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [2]

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 5, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and preferences are respected as much as possible.
