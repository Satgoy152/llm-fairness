Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0   3  44  41  54  79  31  13
1  49  42  54  34  77  86   4  71
2  27  24   3   5  69   4  98  98
3  64  72  27  73  26  35  95  41
4  65  14  12  12  59  82  53  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Additionally, since there are 8 items and 5 agents, at least three agents will receive two items each.

One approach is to allocate items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (79) and 4 (54).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (86) and 4 (77).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 6 (98) and 7 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (72) and 3 (73).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 7 (93) and 5 (82).

We should ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and no item is allocated more than once. After evaluating the items based on their highest valuations for each agent, the following allocation is determined:

- **Agent 0**: Item 5
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 6 and 7
- **Agent 3**: Items 1 and 3
- **Agent 4**: Item 0 and 2

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, each agent receives at least one item, and the total valuation is reasonably high for each agent based on the provided values.
