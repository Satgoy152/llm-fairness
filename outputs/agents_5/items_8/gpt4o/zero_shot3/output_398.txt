Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  79  35  19  24  88  46  53
1  24  59  76   5  84  27  24  19
2  87  50  26  32  33  80  30  77
3  70   9  76  41  28  66  68  45
4  75  20  32  92  45  12  90  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. One way to achieve this is by using a method such as a round-robin allocation, where we assign items to the agent who values them the most until all items are distributed. 

Here is a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value:** For each item, identify which agent values it the most.
2. **Assign the item:** Assign the item to the agent who values it the most.
3. **Repeat:** Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Following the above method, let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0:** Highest value with Agent 2 (87).
- **Item 1:** Highest value with Agent 0 (79).
- **Item 2:** Highest value with Agent 1 (76).
- **Item 3:** Highest value with Agent 4 (92).
- **Item 4:** Highest value with Agent 1 (84).
- **Item 5:** Highest value with Agent 0 (88).
- **Item 6:** Highest value with Agent 4 (90).
- **Item 7:** Highest value with Agent 2 (77).

Now, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, we can distribute further:

- **Agent 0:** [1, 5]
- **Agent 1:** [2, 4]
- **Agent 2:** [0, 7]
- **Agent 3:** []
- **Agent 4:** [3, 6]

Agent 3 gets no items because none of the items were most valued by them, and we have already allocated all 8 items.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while keeping the total number of items allocated to 8.
