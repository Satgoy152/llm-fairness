Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  97  55  43  28   9  26  97
1  80   8  65  55  63  42  66  38
2  92  78  64  99   9  82  64  62
3   5  92  95   9  37  87  67  65
4  35   1  46  69  31  77  52  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and that each agent is satisfied with their allocation based on their valuation of the items. We'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the agents' happiness based on their valuations.

Let's start by assigning items to agents based on the highest valuations for each item, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 92).
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 97).
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (value 95).
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 99).
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 63).
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (value 87).
7. Item 6: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 66).
8. Item 7: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 97).

Now let's distribute the items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 7
- Agent 1: Items 4, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 3
- Agent 3: Items 2, 5
- Agent 4: No items (since all items have been allocated and agent 4 has the lowest valuations)

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": []
}
```
