Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  35  96  22  79  58  64  13
1  37  69  67  12  49  95  37  78
2  43   6  77  77  36   6  78  86
3  56  39  48  25  14  54  62  84
4  23  76  19  78  32   9  65  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items and attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of the items. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations without exceeding the total number of items available.

We have 8 items and 5 agents. We'll try to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item (where possible) and the allocations are balanced. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 4.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 5.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 6 and 7.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 0.

Now, let's allocate the items based on the above observations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5
- Agent 2: Items 6, 7
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 0

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
