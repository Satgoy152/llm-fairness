Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  33  29   8  68  11  97  42
1  75   9  91  16  29  15  42  45
2  81  16  62  59   4  42  83  87
3  40  77  42  98  56  75  76   2
4   9  70  72  24  55  53  20  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

A common approach to fair allocation is to maximize the total value that each agent receives. One way to do this is by using a greedy method where we assign items to agents based on the highest valuation available for each unallocated item. This approach attempts to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 2 with a value of 81
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 2.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 with a value of 77
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 3.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 1 with a value of 91
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 with a value of 98
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 with a value of 68
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 with a value of 75
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 3.

7. **Item 6**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 with a value of 97
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 0.

8. **Item 7**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 2 with a value of 87
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [1, 3, 5],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 4 and 6.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 7.
- Agent 3 receives items 1, 3, and 5.
- Agent 4 receives no items.
