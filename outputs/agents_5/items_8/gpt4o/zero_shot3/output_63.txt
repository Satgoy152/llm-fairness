Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  28   6  25  31  95  45  91
1  36  62  86  79  61  16   7  48
2  54  69  75  20   0  75  65  19
3  57  58  14  61  69   6  11  21
4  28  46   1  63  81  38  69  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing the total valuation for the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. This involves trying to assign items to the agents such that their total value is maximized, but each agent should get at least one item to ensure fairness.

Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Assign each agent at least one item based on their highest value for any item.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure a total of 8 items are assigned.

Based on the table provided:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly (95), so assign item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly (86), so assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly (69), so assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly (69), so assign item 4 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly (81), but since item 4 is already assigned, assign item 3 (63) to agent 4.

Now, we have assigned 5 items, and three items remain to be assigned.

To complete the allocation:
- Assign item 0 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it reasonably (54).
- Assign item 6 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it reasonably (69).
- Assign item 7 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it reasonably (91).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.
