Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53   4   5  43  64  23  75  27
1  83  69  37  28  82  94  26  69
2  19  36  88  16   5  78  66   2
3  86  76  48  16  94  17  44  69
4  64  82  29  29   2  58  16  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [83 69 37 28 82 94 26 69]
 [19 36 88 16  5 78 66  2]
 [86 76 48 16 94 17 44 69]
 [64 82 29 29  2 58 16 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Get items that maximize their utility. Items 0 and 6 have high values.
2. **Agent 1**: Items 5 and 4 are highly valued.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 2 is highly valued.
4. **Agent 3**: Items 3 and 1 have relatively high values.
5. **Agent 4**: Item 7 is the best available option.

Given these considerations, the allocations can be as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 6] (Values: 53, 75)
- Agent 1: [4, 5] (Values: 82, 94)
- Agent 2: [2] (Value: 88)
- Agent 3: [3, 1] (Values: 16, 76)
- Agent 4: [7] (Value: 17)

Here is the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [7]
}
```
