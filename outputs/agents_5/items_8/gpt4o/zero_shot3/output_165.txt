Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25   1  75  29  82  28   3  78
1  67   2  99  30  30  41  93  51
2  87  87  60  16  68  81  12  18
3  14  55  25  63  99  23  79   6
4  45  79  68  54  97  61  30  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the total items such that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their total valuation while ensuring all 8 items are allocated and every agent receives an integer number of items. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive 1 item while others will receive 2 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values for Agent 0 are items 4 (82) and 7 (78).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values for Agent 1 are items 2 (99) and 6 (93).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values for Agent 2 are items 0 (87) and 1 (87).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest values for Agent 3 are items 4 (99) and 6 (79). However, item 4 is already allocated, so we choose the next highest, item 3 (63).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest values for Agent 4 are items 4 (97) and 5 (61). However, item 4 is already allocated, so we choose the next highest, item 1 (79).

Given these preferences, let's allocate the items while ensuring no item is assigned more than once and all agents get at least one item:

- Agent 0: [4, 7]
- Agent 1: [2, 6]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1, 5]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
