Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  80  80   7  18  89  94   7
1  44  78  82  96  57  94  40  92
2  87  75  87  63   3  81  30  26
3  85  76  76  98  65  41  78  97
4  35  29  44  56   8  49  70  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll try to ensure each agent receives items in such a way that their total valuation of the items is balanced. This isn't necessarily straightforward as there are many possible allocations and the definition of "fairness" can vary.

Let's take a step-by-step approach to create a reasonably fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Identify the items with the highest valuations for each agent**:
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (valuation 94)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (valuation 96)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 and 2 (valuation 87)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 and 7 (valuation 98, 97)
   - Agent 4: Item 6 (valuation 70)

2. **Allocate items based on the highest valuation and ensuring each agent gets at least one item**:
   - Start by allocating items where agents have their highest valuations, avoid conflicts, and ensure each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Resolve conflicts and ensure all items are allocated**:
   - If two agents have high valuations for the same item, decide based on the next highest available item or other strategies like ensuring balanced totals.

Here's a suggested allocation based on achieving a reasonable balance:

- Agent 0: [6] (Item 6 has the highest valuation for agent 0)
- Agent 1: [3] (Item 3 has the highest valuation for agent 1)
- Agent 2: [0, 2] (Item 0 and 2 are both highly valued by agent 2)
- Agent 3: [7, 5] (Item 7 and 5 are among the highest, and 5 has a good valuation)
- Agent 4: [1, 4] (Items 1 and 4 provide a fair distribution and reasonable value)

This allocation ensures each agent gets items and all items are allocated. Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7, 5],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to be fair by distributing the items based on the agents' preferences and ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
