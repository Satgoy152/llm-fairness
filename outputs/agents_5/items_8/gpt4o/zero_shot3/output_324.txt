Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  65  15  45  79  11  29   7  81
1  87  63  96  31  82  74  23  67
2  55  71  66  43  91  49  30   9
3  33  68  18  56  57  14  62  41
4  17  79  71  31  33  72   0  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 15 45 79 11 29  7 81]
 [87 63 96 31 82 74 23 67]
 [55 71 66 43 91 49 30  9]
 [33 68 18 56 57 14 62 41]
 [17 79 71 31 33 72  0 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Considering the preferences from the table, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0:
  - Values item 3 the most (79)
  - Values item 7 the second most (81)

- Agent 1:
  - Values item 2 the most (96)
  - Values item 0 the second most (87)

- Agent 2:
  - Values item 4 the most (91)
  - Values item 1 the second most (71)

- Agent 3:
  - Values item 6 the most (62)
  - Values item 1 the second most (68) and item 3 the third most (56)

- Agent 4:
  - Values item 5 the most (72)
  - Values item 1 the second most (79)

After considering the values and ensuring all items are allocated:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4

Now, let's present this allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 1]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
