Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  62  80  68  74  90  69  75  81
1  55  35  55  18  16  71  97  63
2  82  76  41   3  77  17  32  69
3  51  98  29  32  92  16  10   8
4  55  41  55  86  43  77  34  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's total value for the items they receive, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high values for items, particularly item 4 and item 7. Allocating items 4 and 7 to Agent 0 gives them a good total value.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 6 highly, so it's beneficial to allocate item 6 to this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 and item 1 highly, so allocating these items to Agent 2 is advantageous.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 1. However, given that item 1 is already allocated, we focus on other items. Agent 3 could benefit from item 3 based on the remaining options.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has a decent valuation for item 5, so allocating this item to Agent 4 is a reasonable choice.

Given these observations, a fair allocation can be:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [6]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 3: Items [3]
- Agent 4: Items [2, 5]

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```
