Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  86  32  69  92  86  33  23
1  20  35  50  94  18   6  60  65
2  61  62  56  97  76  25  17  37
3   0  61  36  76  10  96  79  37
4  48  48  47  72  26   3  31  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible, given their valuations. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations for Each Item:** 
   - Item 0: 19 + 20 + 61 + 0 + 48 = 148
   - Item 1: 86 + 35 + 62 + 61 + 48 = 292
   - Item 2: 32 + 50 + 56 + 36 + 47 = 221
   - Item 3: 69 + 94 + 97 + 76 + 72 = 408
   - Item 4: 92 + 18 + 76 + 10 + 26 = 222
   - Item 5: 86 + 6 + 25 + 96 + 3 = 216
   - Item 6: 33 + 60 + 17 + 79 + 31 = 220
   - Item 7: 23 + 65 + 37 + 37 + 94 = 256

2. **Allocate Items Based on Valuations:**
   - Try to give each agent the item(s) they value the most while ensuring a balanced distribution of total value.

3. **Allocate Items to Agents:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 92), Item 6 (value 33)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (value 94), Item 7 (value 65)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (value 61)
   - Agent 3: Item 5 (value 96)
   - Agent 4: Item 1 (value 48), Item 2 (value 47)

This allocation aims to distribute the items based on the highest valuation each agent has for any item, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent included in the allocation, even if they receive no items.
