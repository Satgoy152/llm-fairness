Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  87  26  75  66  82  21  27
1   2  70   7   3  78  73  92  87
2  32  66   1  24  77  79  25  78
3  63   8  82  52  35  41  76  79
4  77  71  53  74  20  64  68  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we need to distribute the 8 items in such a way that each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is as balanced as possible in terms of value.

One way to achieve this is to use a "round-robin" type of allocation strategy or to allocate items based on the highest value each agent has for an item that hasn't been allocated yet. For simplicity, we'll use a combination of both approaches to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Start by giving each agent their highest-value item that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. If an agent has received an item, move to the next agent.
3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Let's execute this plan:

- Agent 0 values items: [51, 87, 26, 75, 66, 82, 21, 27]. Highest is item 1 (87).
- Agent 1 values items: [2, 70, 7, 3, 78, 73, 92, 87]. Highest is item 6 (92).
- Agent 2 values items: [32, 66, 1, 24, 77, 79, 25, 78]. Highest is item 5 (79).
- Agent 3 values items: [63, 8, 82, 52, 35, 41, 76, 79]. Highest is item 2 (82).
- Agent 4 values items: [77, 71, 53, 74, 20, 64, 68, 20]. Highest is item 0 (77).

After this round, we have distributed items 0, 1, 2, 5, and 6. The remaining items are 3, 4, and 7.

Continue allocating the remaining items:

- Next highest value for Agent 0 is item 5 (82), but it's already taken. So, next is item 3 (75).
- Agent 1 next highest available is item 7 (87).
- Agent 2 next highest available is item 4 (77).

Now all items are allocated with each agent receiving at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.
