Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  74  97  72  14  11   7  84  93
1  64  89  20  99  59  51  49  67
2  42  49  27  89  84  12  59  89
3  27  16  23  41  56   8  90   6
4  15  93  62  18   7  19  16  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the agents' satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One common method to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring all agents get at least one item. 

Let's go through the steps to allocate the items:

1. **Assign the highest valued item to each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 1 (value = 97)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (value = 99)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (value = 42)
   - Agent 3: Item 6 (value = 90)
   - Agent 4: Item 1 (value = 93) - Already assigned to Agent 0, so we move to the next highest, Item 2 (value = 62)

2. **Assign remaining items:**
   - Items left: 4, 5, 7
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2 (value = 84)
   - Assign Item 5 to Agent 1 (value = 51)
   - Assign Item 7 to Agent 0 (value = 93)

Now, let's ensure a fair distribution, aiming to maximize value while each agent gets at least one item. Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation attempts to maximize the value for each agent based on their preferences.
