Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  60  70  40  43  40  53   3
1  44  55  16  46  43  25  17  18
2  78  20  83  50  95  14  18  47
3  34  55  33  97  32  83  13   9
4  11  24  21  73  48  96  58  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 0 the highest, so we assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 1, so we assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 4 the highest, so we assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 3, so we assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 5 the highest, so we assign item 5 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (2, 6, 7) to the agents:

6. **Agent 4**: We'll allocate item 6 to agent 4, as it is also relatively high-valued for this agent.
7. **Agent 2**: We assign item 2 to agent 2, as it is the next highest value for this agent after item 4.
8. **Agent 0**: We assign item 7 to agent 0, as it is the next highest value for this agent.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
