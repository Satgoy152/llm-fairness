Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  84  98  85  65  50   2  40
1   2  30  10  56  79  78  70  10
2  84  16  51  54   7  11  88  43
3  37   9  61  39  75  50   5  49
4  89  66  87  18  55  64   7  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers both maximizing the total value received by each agent and ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We will aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Now, let's proceed with this method:

- Item 0: Highest value for Agent 4 (89)
- Item 1: Highest value for Agent 0 (84)
- Item 2: Highest value for Agent 0 (98)
- Item 3: Highest value for Agent 0 (85)
- Item 4: Highest value for Agent 1 (79)
- Item 5: Highest value for Agent 1 (78)
- Item 6: Highest value for Agent 2 (88)
- Item 7: Highest value for Agent 3 (49)

This allocation gives:
- Agent 0: Items 1, 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Item 0

Now, let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0]
}
```
