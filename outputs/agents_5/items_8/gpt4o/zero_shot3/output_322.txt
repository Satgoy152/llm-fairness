Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  85  31  56  47  70  41  35
1  93  88  95  14   4  30  97  58
2  16  40  91  77  21  46   2  93
3  98  47  92  31  65  36  67  75
4  36   1  47  29  90   8   3  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction (or valuation) of each agent while ensuring that all 8 items are distributed. Hereâ€™s one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's perform the allocation:

Agent 0 total valuation: 15 + 85 + 31 + 56 + 47 + 70 + 41 + 35 = 380  
Agent 1 total valuation: 93 + 88 + 95 + 14 + 4 + 30 + 97 + 58 = 479  
Agent 2 total valuation: 16 + 40 + 91 + 77 + 21 + 46 + 2 + 93 = 386  
Agent 3 total valuation: 98 + 47 + 92 + 31 + 65 + 36 + 67 + 75 = 511  
Agent 4 total valuation: 36 + 1 + 47 + 29 + 90 + 8 + 3 + 94 = 308  

Based on total valuations, we prioritize assigning higher value items to agents who value them more, while also ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

### Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** [5, 0] - (70 + 15 = 85)
- **Agent 1:** [2, 6] - (95 + 97 = 192)
- **Agent 2:** [3] - (77)
- **Agent 3:** [1] - (85)
- **Agent 4:** [4, 7] - (90 + 94 = 184)

This allocation maximizes the satisfaction for each agent, keeping the total number of items at 8 and ensuring a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation represented in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
