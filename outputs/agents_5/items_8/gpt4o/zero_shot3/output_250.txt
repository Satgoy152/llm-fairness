Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  67  14  29  83  77  52   4
1  95   1  20  86  81   8  32   4
2  93  62  61  55   7  29  93  22
3  13  38  11  74  96  45  43  12
4  84  66  58  72  87  39  88  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can employ a method that balances the total value each agent receives. One common approach is to use a form of the "round-robin" allocation, where each agent picks an item in turns based on their valuation until all items are allocated. 

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each agent in a fair manner:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (83).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (95).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (93), but it's already taken. Next is item 6 (93).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (96), but it's already taken. Next is item 3 (74).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (87), but it's already taken. Next is item 6 (88), but it's already taken. Next is item 0 (84), but it's already taken. Next is item 3 (72), but it's already taken. Then item 1 (66).

Now, let's go for the second round:

6. **Agent 0**: Next highest that is not taken is item 5 (77).
7. **Agent 1**: Next highest that is not taken is item 3 (86), but it's already taken. Then item 4 (81), but it's already taken. Next is item 2 (20).
8. **Agent 2**: Next highest that is not taken is item 1 (62).

After considering the fairness and ensuring all items are allocated, here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has received items based on their highest available valuations, and all 8 items are fairly distributed among the 5 agents.
