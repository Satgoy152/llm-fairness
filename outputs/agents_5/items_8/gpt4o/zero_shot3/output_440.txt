Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  15  95  23  57  51   2  26  47
1  64  69  27  40  53  17  13  89
2   1  48  52  48   5  92  72  73
3  38  10  19  76   6  31  48  32
4  86  96  11  31  67  66  47   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I'll consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total value while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Given the constraint that there are 8 items and 5 agents, one or more agents will inevitably receive more than one item.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning each agent the item that they value the most, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.

2. After each agent has at least one item, assign the remaining items to the agents who can gain the most additional value from them.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (95).
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most (89).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (92).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (76).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most, but it's already allocated to agent 0, so the next highest is item 0 (86).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2: Assign to Agent 2 (52).
- Item 4: Assign to Agent 1 (53).
- Item 6: Assign to Agent 0 (26).

Finally, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
