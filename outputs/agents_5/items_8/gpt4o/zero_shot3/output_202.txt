Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  14  59  79  41  60  91  41
1  70  56  13  75  25  40  24  41
2  98  40  85  99  12  17  49  47
3  48  36  75  35  56  48  22  66
4  51  20  15  41  51  87  84  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we consider each agent's valuations and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, not every agent will receive an equal number of items, but we can try to balance the distribution as best as possible.

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are relatively high for item 6 (91) and item 3 (79).
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are relatively high for item 0 (70) and item 3 (75).
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are highest for item 3 (99) and item 0 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are relatively high for item 2 (75) and item 7 (66).
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are relatively high for item 5 (87) and item 7 (85).

Given these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 receives items: [6]
- Agent 1 receives items: [0]
- Agent 2 receives items: [3]
- Agent 3 receives items: [2, 7]
- Agent 4 receives items: [5, 1, 4]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution considers the highest valuations where possible.

Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [5, 1, 4]
}
```
