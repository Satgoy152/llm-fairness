Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  74  59  60  30  48  58  19
1  68  76  23  81  48  14  81  53
2  60   4  13  45  16  85  33  46
3  95  21  69  50  59  86  98  12
4  64  86  14  67  69  58  98  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of items based on their preferences. One approach is to allocate items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation that aims to maximize the total value for each agent:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 81).
2. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 85).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 3 (value 95).
4. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value 98).
5. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 86).
6. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value 69).
7. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 59).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 0 (value 19).

This allocation is designed to give each agent a reasonable share of their preferred items while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
