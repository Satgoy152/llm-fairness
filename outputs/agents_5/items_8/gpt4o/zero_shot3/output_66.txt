Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  11  56  56  31  74  66  30
1  65  93  86  35  75  13  81  27
2  24  72  11  56  67  75  40  38
3  56  60  43  27  23  18   9  19
4  76  68  74  16  93  98  96  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We need to ensure that all 8 items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. A simple way to approach this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 88.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 93.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 86.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 and Agent 2 both value it at 56, but Agent 0 already has an item, so assign it to Agent 2.
5. Item 4: Agent 4 values it the highest at 93.
6. Item 5: Agent 4 values it the highest at 98.
7. Item 6: Agent 4 values it the highest at 96.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the highest at 30.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and adjust as necessary to maintain fairness:

- Agent 0 has items: [0, 7]
- Agent 1 has items: [1, 2]
- Agent 2 has items: [3]
- Agent 3 has no items, but we can give them item 7 instead of Agent 0 to balance it out a bit.
- Agent 4 has items: [4, 5, 6]

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4, 5, 6]
}
```

This ensures that all items are allocated while trying to maximize the individual agent's valuation of the items they receive, and every agent is considered.
