Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  27  86  67  40  46  68  89  51
1  47  20  23  29  63  24  53  90
2   1  14  98  55  14  70  38  53
3   9  66  64  63   0   1  53  44
4  86  68   9  93  60  22  88  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to give each agent items that they value highly while ensuring that all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents. We'll try to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent.

Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If two agents have the same valuation for an item, assign it to the agent with fewer items.

Let's allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most (86).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (86).
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (98).
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most (93).
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (63).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (70).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (89).
- Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most (96).

Now, let's check how many items each agent has and adjust if necessary to ensure a fair distribution:

- Agent 0: [1, 6]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [0, 3, 7]

Agent 3 currently has no items, so let's adjust the allocation by considering items with the next highest valuations:

- Agent 3 values item 3 second-highest after Agent 4, so we can reassign item 3 to Agent 3.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [1, 6]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [2, 5]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [0, 7]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```
