Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  13  15  25  77   5  91  24  35
1  35  49  98  32  41  24  37   4
2  20  74  35  68  18  65  94  74
3  45  27  87  42  54  62  10  22
4  40  64  61  56   4  35  35  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each item is assigned to one agent, and all agents are considered. We aim to balance the allocation based on the given valuations, attempting to maximize total satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for this item).
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for this item).
3. Assign Item 6 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for this item).
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for this item).
5. Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation, after 3).
6. Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 (second highest valuation, after 2).
7. Assign Item 1 to Agent 4 (highest valuation for this item).
8. Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation, after 0).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable number of items based on their valuations, and every item is assigned to one agent.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
``` 

This allocation uses all eight items while ensuring each agent is considered.
