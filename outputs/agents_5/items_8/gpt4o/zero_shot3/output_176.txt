Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  40   7  72  59  72  62  68
1  61  79  93  53   7  92  19   6
2   1  99  63  47  82  22  97  19
3  20  62   0  35   1  68  94  66
4  94  72  75  10   9  95  45  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. One approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item where possible.

Let's look at the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most (94).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most (99).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most (93).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (72).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most (82).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 values it the most (95).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most (94).
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most (68).

Now, let's compile these allocations into the required JSON format, ensuring each agent is included, even if they receive no items:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 3 and 7.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 6.
- Agent 4 receives items 0 and 5.

All 8 items have been allocated among the agents.
