Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57   6  23  55  31  49  37   4
1  31  11  30  94  55  71  29  88
2  10   6  70  81  91  44  79  98
3  80  36  90  57  78  18  65  89
4  14  93  88  17   8  98  17  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to assign the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible, considering their valuations. We will distribute the items while ensuring that each agent ends up with a reasonable allocation based on their preferences.

Here are the allocations:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, since agent 0 values it the highest (57).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 4, since agent 4 values it the highest (93).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3, since agent 3 values it the highest (90).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1, since agent 1 values it the highest (94).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it the highest (91).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 4, since agent 4 values it the highest (98).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it the highest (79).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 1, since agent 1 values it the highest (88).

This distribution ensures that each agent gets at least one item (except for agent 0, who only values the first item significantly) and balances the allocation based on their highest preferences.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
