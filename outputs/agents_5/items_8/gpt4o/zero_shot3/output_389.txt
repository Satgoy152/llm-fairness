Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  60  76  99  95  57  51  61
1  11  80  88  58  42  83  13  17
2  84  14  12   0  89   8  65  12
3  32  89   8  10  14  42  70  44
4  10  80  46  11  41  77  85  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the overall valuations and distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences. Given that there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more than one item while others may receive just one or none, depending on the allocations.

A possible approach to allocate items fairly is to balance the total value each agent receives, ensuring each gets an approximate share of the total valuation. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's perform the allocation:

### Total Valuation per Agent
- Agent 0: 58 + 60 + 76 + 99 + 95 + 57 + 51 + 61 = 557
- Agent 1: 11 + 80 + 88 + 58 + 42 + 83 + 13 + 17 = 392
- Agent 2: 84 + 14 + 12 + 0 + 89 + 8 + 65 + 12 = 284
- Agent 3: 32 + 89 + 8 + 10 + 14 + 42 + 70 + 44 = 309
- Agent 4: 10 + 80 + 46 + 11 + 41 + 77 + 85 + 41 = 391

### Allocation Strategy
1. Assign items to agents starting with their highest valued items, ensuring a fair spread:
   - Agent 0 should get item 3 (99) and item 4 (95).
   - Agent 1 should get item 2 (88) and item 5 (83).
   - Agent 2 should get item 0 (84).
   - Agent 3 should get item 6 (70).
   - Agent 4 should get item 1 (80) and item 7 (41).

Now, this allocation ensures that each agent receives items corresponding to their high valuations, ensuring fairness in terms of value distribution.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation provides a balanced distribution of items based on the agents' preferences while ensuring each item is allocated.
