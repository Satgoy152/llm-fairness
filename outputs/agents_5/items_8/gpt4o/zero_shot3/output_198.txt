Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  41  22  16  73  52  59  90
1  70  15  79  35  96  60  52  81
2  33  30  75  91  97  98   0  71
3  87  53  62  94  92  72  98  31
4  53  14  11  20  29  55  70  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given the constraints, a possible allocation strategy is as follows:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that maximize their valuations, such as items with higher values.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that are highly valued by them but not by others.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items with high values for them.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items with high values for them.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate the remaining items, considering high valuations.

After analyzing the table, here is a potential fair allocation:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 7 and 4.
- Agent 1 has high values for items 4 and 2.
- Agent 2 has high values for items 5 and 6.
- Agent 3 has high values for items 3 and 0.
- Agent 4 will take the remaining items.

**Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [7]
- Agent 1: Items [2]
- Agent 2: Items [5]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 0]
- Agent 4: Items [1, 4, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [1, 4, 6]
}
```
