Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  87  17  15  38  52  23  79
1  43  81  88  59  49  99  22  93
2  20  15  23  10  51  37  21  37
3  21  68  21  90  15  22  13   9
4  68  97  79   5  48  75  86  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [43 81 88 59 49 99 22 93]
 [20 15 23 10 51 37 21 37]
 [21 68 21 90 15 22 13  9]
 [68 97 79  5 48 75 86 54]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow a strategy that maximizes the total valuation, ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. We can do this by prioritizing assignments based on the highest valuations for each item.

Let's allocate items step-by-step while keeping track of the constraints:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the highest with 68, so assign item 0 to agent 4.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 also values it the highest with 97, so assign item 1 to agent 4.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest with 88, so assign item 2 to agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the highest with 90, so assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the highest with 51, so assign item 4 to agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the highest with 99, so assign item 5 to agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the highest with 86, so assign item 6 to agent 4.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it the highest with 93, so assign item 7 to agent 1.

Now, examining our allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: No items
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5, 7
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Items 0, 1, 6

Finally, here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 5, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 1, 6]
}
```
