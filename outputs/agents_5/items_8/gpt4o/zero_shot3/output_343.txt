Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  43  48  20  23  76  49  51  45
1   1  67  13  78  79  90  89  80
2  15   1  23  60  43  98  76  41
3  34  64  42  85  50  24  26  25
4   0  23  96  38  60  33  41  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, provided each agent ends up with a reasonable share of the total items. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation based on the highest values:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 43 by Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 67 by Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 96 by Agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 85 by Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 79 by Agent 1.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 98 by Agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: The highest value is 89 by Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: The highest value is 80 by Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 6, 7
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 2

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and every agent receives at least one item. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4, 6, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
