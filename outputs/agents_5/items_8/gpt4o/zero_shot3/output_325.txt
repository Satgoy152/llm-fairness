Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  58  55  80   4  16  84  38
1  23  47  16  23  41  67  31  49
2  92  85  46   5  35  75  54  93
3  41   5  53   1  11  14  46  84
4  26   7  16  94  77  61  44  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in such a way that the total value of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible. This may involve assigning items based on the highest relative value that each agent places on them, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of allocated items is 8.

Here is a potential allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items, and then allocate the items that each agent values the most within their top preferences.

2. Attempt to balance the overall value received by each agent.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Receives item 6 (value = 84)
- Agent 1: Receives items 5 and 7 (value = 67, 49)
- Agent 2: Receives items 0 and 3 (value = 92, 5)
- Agent 3: Receives item 2 (value = 53)
- Agent 4: Receives items 1 and 4 (value = 7, 77)

This allocation ensures that:
- Each agent receives an integer number of items.
- All 8 items are allocated.
- The allocation aims to maximize fairness in terms of the total value each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
