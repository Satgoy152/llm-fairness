Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  62  68  85  15  21  24  68
1  93  72  28  23  19  51  74  56
2  36  14   1  30  30  19   9  64
3  53  55  95  24  71  12  97  75
4  20  39   4  54  75  56  79  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. This involves considering the preferences of each agent and distributing the items in a way that balances these preferences.

We can start by looking at the highest-valued items for each agent and then allocate them in a manner that tries to maximize the total value received by each agent. Let's attempt this allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 0 (95).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 6 (74).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 7 (64).
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 2 (95).
5. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 4 (75).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items. We will try to distribute them in a manner that ensures each agent's overall satisfaction is considered:

- Agent 0 can also take item 3 (85).
- Agent 1 can take item 1 (72).
- Agent 3 can take item 5 (12).
- Agent 4 can take item 7 (71).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents based on their highest preferences for specific items.
