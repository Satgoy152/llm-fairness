Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  10  41  37  90  53  36  38
1  13  31  34  31  56  69   8   9
2   2  50  29  29  52  81  33  62
3  58  32  11  45  77  24  12  71
4   4  17   5  97  29  26  73  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4. Let's allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 5. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 7. Let's allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0. Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 3. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (1, 2, and 6) to maximize the overall satisfaction:

6. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1. Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

7. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has a relatively high valuation for item 2. Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

8. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 6. Let's allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents.
