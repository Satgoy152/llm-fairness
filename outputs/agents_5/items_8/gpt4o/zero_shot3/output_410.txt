Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57   3  40  21  69  29  25  47
1   8   2  13  30   1  63  94   6
2  40  63  63  86  55  43  11  33
3  30  88  28  45  31  97  20  36
4  95  55  79  63  19  40  15  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for any item and start by allocating those items.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. Allocate the remaining items based on maximizing the total valuation across all agents.

Let's go through the steps:

- Agent 0's highest valuation is 69 for item 4.
- Agent 1's highest valuation is 94 for item 6.
- Agent 2's highest valuation is 86 for item 3.
- Agent 3's highest valuation is 97 for item 5.
- Agent 4's highest valuation is 95 for item 0.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 3, 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 items left to allocate (1, 2, and 7).

We'll allocate the remaining items based on the highest remaining valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 7 (57 and 47), but 0 is already allocated.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 5 and 6 (63 and 94), but both are allocated.
- Agent 2 has high valuation for item 2 (63).
- Agent 3 has high valuation for item 1 (88).
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 2 (79) and 1 (55).

Assign remaining items:
- Give item 1 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for unallocated item).
- Give item 2 to Agent 4 (second-highest valuation for remaining items).
- Give item 7 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for remaining item).

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
