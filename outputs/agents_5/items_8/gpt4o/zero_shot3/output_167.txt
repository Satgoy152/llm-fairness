Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50   9  34   6  58  34  80  22
1  38  13  38  88  43   0  74  97
2  43  71  16  29  14  50  18  69
3  96  10  63  31  74  36   2  77
4  99  52  34  91  15  15  36  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider an allocation method that attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One approach is to assign items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Review the valuations for each item and determine which agent values each item the most.
2. Allocate each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent is considered in the allocation process as much as possible.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most at 99.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most at 71.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 63.
- Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most at 88.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most at 58.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 50.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most at 74.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.

After this allocation, some agents may not have received any items. We should ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, or at least be considered in the allocation process in a fair manner. Given the constraints of the task, some agents may end up with no items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 6, 7],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute items based on the highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
