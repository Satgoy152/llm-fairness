Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  65  44  49  55  86  73  21
1  45  15  56  89  98  39   0  12
2  34  15  83  60   0  34  36  86
3  39  65  62  44  24  28  36  73
4   7  99  26  10  49  84  27  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by ensuring each agent gets at least one item, beginning with the item that they value the most.
2. Allocate the remaining items to maximize the total value for the agents.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 5 with a value of 86.
- Agent 1: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 4 with a value of 98.
- Agent 2: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 2 with a value of 83.
- Agent 3: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 1 with a value of 65.
- Agent 4: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 1 with a value of 99, but since item 1 is already taken, the next highest value is item 5 with a value of 84.

Now, we distribute the remaining items considering the highest value for each agent:

- Remaining items: 0, 3, 6, 7
- Agent 0: The next highest value for Agent 0 is item 0 with a value of 56.
- Agent 1: The next highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 with a value of 89.
- Agent 3: The next highest value for Agent 3 is item 6 with a value of 36.
- Agent 4: The next highest value for Agent 4 is item 7 with a value of 56.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation fairly distributes the items among the agents while maximizing the values based on their preferences.
