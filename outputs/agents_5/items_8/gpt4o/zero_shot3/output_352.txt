Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  32  76   3  75  38  62   1
1   2  87  51  52  55  90  87  89
2  32  19  85  74  31   3  48  18
3   8  92  13  21  55  33   3  24
4  89  81  14  54   5  78  41  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction by assigning items in a way that each agent receives the items they value most, while ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - There are 5 agents and 8 items.
   - Each agent will receive approximately 1 or 2 items.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most among those not yet allocated.
   - Continue the allocation until all items are allocated.

3. **Performing the Allocation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value 83).
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the most (value 90).
   - Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value 85).
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the most (value 92).
   - Agent 4 values item 0 the most, but itâ€™s already taken, so assign them item 4 (value 5).

4. **Second Round Allocation:**
   - For Agent 0, assign item 6 (value 62).
   - For Agent 1, assign item 7 (value 89).
   - For Agent 3, assign item 3 (value 21).

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item if possible.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 5 and 7.
- Agent 2 receives item 2.
- Agent 3 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 4 receives item 4.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations while all items are distributed.
