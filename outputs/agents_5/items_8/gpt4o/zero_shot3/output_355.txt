Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  46  18  36  24  97  15  74
1  31   0  52  38   9  21  48  23
2  51  24   3  34   3  17  79  61
3  32  83  87  47  24  14  15  79
4   9  48  36  22  49  57  57  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31  0 52 38  9 21 48 23]

 [ 9 48 36 22 49 57 57 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to give each agent items that maximize their overall satisfaction, ensuring that all 8 items are allocated. Given the valuations, we can try to assign items based on the highest value from an unallocated item for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0: Assign item 5 (value 97) to Agent 0, as it is the highest valued item for this agent.
2. Agent 1: Assign item 2 (value 52) to Agent 1, as it is the highest valued item for this agent.
3. Agent 2: Assign item 6 (value 79) to Agent 2, as it is the highest valued item for this agent.
4. Agent 3: Assign item 2 (value 87) to Agent 3, but it's already allocated, so assign item 1 (value 83) instead, the next highest.
5. Agent 4: Assign item 7 (value 89) to Agent 4, as it is the highest valued item for this agent.

Now, we need to distribute the remaining items:

6. Agent 0: Assign item 7 (value 74) to Agent 0, the next highest available value for this agent.
7. Agent 1: Assign item 3 (value 38) to Agent 1, the next highest available value.
8. Agent 3: Assign item 0 (value 32) to Agent 3, the next highest available value.

Now, each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 0],
    "4": []
}
```
