Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  41  55  70  77  98  25  55
1   5  99  83  42   7  56  73  48
2  84  50  92  75  38  69  43  69
3  94  19  10  49  52   2  87   7
4  74  18  82  56  22  35  76  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a reasonably valued item based on their preferences. The objective is to maximize the overall satisfaction by matching items to agents based on their valuations. Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 5 the highest at 98. We allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 1 the highest at 99. We allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 the highest at 92. We allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 the highest at 94. We allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 6 the highest at 76. We allocate item 6 to agent 4.

The remaining items 3, 4, and 7 need to be allocated. We continue by checking the next highest preferences:

- **Agent 0** has the next highest preference for item 4 at 77.
- **Agent 2** has a secondary preference for item 3 at 75.
- **Agent 4** has a secondary preference for item 7 at 21.

Therefore, the final allocation is:
- Agent 0: Items 4, 5
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 3
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Items 6, 7

This allocation distributes all items fairly based on the agents' preferences.

{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```
