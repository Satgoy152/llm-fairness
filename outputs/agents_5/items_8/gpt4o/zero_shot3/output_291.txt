Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  62  40  22  15  19  57   3
1  38  34   2  51  34  38  22   5
2  73  26  82  76  26  59  50  73
3  23   9  83  31  25  90  31  19
4  85  42   9  60  68  39  51  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll try to distribute the items in a way that optimizes the overall satisfaction.

Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents with high individual valuations first.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. Try to balance the total valuations across all agents.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 and 7.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4.

Distributing the items with these considerations leads us to the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Item [3]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 3: Item [5]
- Agent 4: Item [4, 6]

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item.
