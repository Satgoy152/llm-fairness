Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  32  82  39  69  73  54   4
1  67  11  50  25  89  94  26  82
2  97  61   0  21  87  93  50  40
3   6  86  73   6  61  40  49  44
4  30  14  59  97  97  99  42   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. This is a simple approach that doesn't necessarily guarantee an optimal allocation but aims to spread the items in a reasonable manner.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (value 91), 2 (value 82)
   - Allocate items: 0, 2

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (value 94), 4 (value 89)
   - Allocate items: 5, 4

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (value 97), 5 (value 93)
   - Allocate item: 6 (value 50)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 1 (value 86), 2 (value 73)
   - Allocate item: 3

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (value 99), 4 (value 97)
   - Allocate items: 1, 7

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 8. Adjust allocations if necessary:

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Items 1, 4, 7

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4, 7]
}
```
