Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  28  81  24  48  75  78  27
1  40  33   3  34   9  50  73   1
2  75  54   5  23  35  30  60  98
3  56  99  81  86  56   0  98  66
4  96  64  37  97  86  38  88  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 64 37 97 86 38 88 80]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are assigned. We want to consider the valuations provided and distribute the items to maximize the satisfaction of each agent as much as possible given their preferences.

Let's assign the items by considering the highest value each agent assigns to the available items, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 has the highest value (88) for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 5 has the highest value (50) for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Item 7 has the highest value (98) for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Item 1 has the highest value (99) for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Item 3 has the highest value (97) for Agent 4.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0**: Item 6 has the next highest value (78) for Agent 0.
7. **Agent 3**: Item 2 has the next highest value (81) for Agent 3.
8. **Agent 4**: Item 4 has the next highest value (86) for Agent 4.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and the assignments are made based on maximizing the valuations.
