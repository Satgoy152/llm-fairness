Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  98  82  88  56  68   0  59
1  65  78  61  38  10  17  42  87
2  64  25   3  89  61   6   0  83
3  37  98  57  85  42  49  68  94
4  75  85  74  86  57  64  34  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 78 61 38 10 17 42 87]
 [64 25  3 89 61  6  0 83]

 [75 85 74 86 57 64 34 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent gets while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We will use a simple greedy approach, iterating over the items and assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives to ensure fairness.

Let's begin by analyzing the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [34, 98, 82, 88, 56, 68, 0, 59]
Agent 1: [65, 78, 61, 38, 10, 17, 42, 87]
Agent 2: [64, 25, 3, 89, 61, 6, 0, 83]
Agent 3: [37, 98, 57, 85, 42, 49, 68, 94]
Agent 4: [75, 85, 74, 86, 57, 64, 34, 17]
```

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:** Highest value is 75 (Agent 4).
2. **Item 1:** Highest value is 98 (shared by Agent 0 and Agent 3). Assign to Agent 0 due to tie-break preference.
3. **Item 2:** Highest value is 82 (Agent 0).
4. **Item 3:** Highest value is 89 (Agent 2).
5. **Item 4:** Highest value is 61 (Agent 2).
6. **Item 5:** Highest value is 68 (Agent 0).
7. **Item 6:** Highest value is 68 (Agent 3).
8. **Item 7:** Highest value is 94 (Agent 3).

Checking the allocation, we want to ensure each agent receives at least one item, and that all items are distributed. Adjustments might be necessary to distribute items more evenly, considering the next highest values:

- **Agent 0:** [1, 2, 5] (3 items)
- **Agent 1:** [ ] (0 items)
- **Agent 2:** [3, 4] (2 items)
- **Agent 3:** [6, 7] (2 items)
- **Agent 4:** [0] (1 item)

To ensure Agent 1 receives an item and no agent receives too many items, we can adjust:

- Assign Item 1 to Agent 1 instead of Agent 0, as Agent 1 has the next highest preference for Item 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [0]
}
```
