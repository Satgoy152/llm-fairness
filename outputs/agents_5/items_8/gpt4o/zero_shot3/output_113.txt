Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  57  71  58  16  55  93  10  53
1  53   1  93  85  60  21  27   6
2  77   4  20  77  99  49  28  74
3  64  11  22  39  37  90  72  73
4  15  24  26  65  35  26  80  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[57 71 58 16 55 93 10 53]
 [53  1 93 85 60 21 27  6]
 [77  4 20 77 99 49 28 74]

 [15 24 26 65 35 26 80 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's overall value while ensuring every item is allocated. Here's one way to allocate the items based on their valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 5 (93) and a moderate value for item 1 (71).
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 2 (93) and a high valuation for item 3 (85).
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest valuation for item 4 (99) and a high valuation for item 0 (77).
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 5 (90) and 6 (72).
5. **Agent 4**: Has a relatively high valuation for item 6 (80).

Using this strategy, we can allocate items as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Items [1, 5]
- **Agent 1**: Items [2, 3]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 4]
- **Agent 3**: Item [7]
- **Agent 4**: Item [6]

The allocations ensure that each item is assigned to an agent, with the aim of maximizing the total valuation for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6]
}
```
