Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  47  81  51  26  94  65  99  61
1   3  63  59  70  16  70   9  29
2  18   0  35  42  95  94  16  49
3  17  95  78  80   4  10  10  28
4  46  25  73  87   2  71  28  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. A potential strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, this may not always be possible, especially with constraints on fairness and the number of items per agent. Let's attempt a balanced allocation:

1. Assign the highest value items to the agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure each agent has at least one item and no agent has more than two items initially, given we have 8 items and 5 agents.

Let's analyze the table for allocations:

- Agent 0: Highest values are 99 (item 6) and 94 (item 4).
- Agent 1: Highest values are 70 (items 3 and 5).
- Agent 2: Highest values are 95 (item 4) and 94 (item 5).
- Agent 3: Highest values are 95 (item 1) and 80 (item 3).
- Agent 4: Highest values are 87 (item 3) and 73 (item 2).

Based on this, we can make the following allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4 (value 94) and 6 (value 99)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (value 70)
- Agent 2: Item 7 (value 49)
- Agent 3: Items 1 (value 95) and 3 (value 80)
- Agent 4: Items 0 (value 46) and 2 (value 73)

This allocation is not perfect, but it ensures each agent gets a fair share based on the highest value they can get from the remaining items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures fairness by distributing items based on each agent's highest valuations while also ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and no items are left unallocated.
