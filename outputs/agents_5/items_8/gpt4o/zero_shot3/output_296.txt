Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  71  84  81  30  93  20  68
1  11   6  12  19  76  20  20  36
2  22  17  89  59  38  76  16  74
3   6   0  24  67   5  48  13   3
4  83  69  69  55  14   7  60  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step plan for an allocation:

1. **Initial Assignment**: First, assign each agent at least one item based on their highest valuation to ensure fairness.

2. **Subsequent Allocation**: Distribute the remaining items to maximize the overall value for each agent while considering their remaining highest valuations.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign item 5 (valuation = 93)
- Agent 1: Assign item 4 (valuation = 76)
- Agent 2: Assign item 2 (valuation = 89)
- Agent 3: Assign item 3 (valuation = 67)
- Agent 4: Assign item 0 (valuation = 83)

3. **Distribute Remaining Items**:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (valuation = 74)
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (valuation = 71)
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (valuation = 60)

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```
