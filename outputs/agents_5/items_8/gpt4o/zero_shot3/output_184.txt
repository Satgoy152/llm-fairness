Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  16  61  48  61  87  14  45
1  44  82  80  12  93  72  73  71
2  40  88  75  77  29   7  43  65
3  73  67  81  40  21  86  34  56
4  41  45  45  37  37  64  41  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[12 16 61 48 61 87 14 45]
 [44 82 80 12 93 72 73 71]
 [40 88 75 77 29  7 43 65]

 [41 45 45 37 37 64 41 90]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 highly at 87. We will allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly at 93. We will allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly at 88. We will allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly at 81. We will allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 highly at 90. We will allocate item 7 to Agent 4.

After allocating these high-value items, we have 3 more items to allocate (items 0, 3, 6).

6. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 3 at 73. We will allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
7. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 2 at 77. We will allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
8. Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 1 at 73. We will allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the total values for them reasonably based on their preferences.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2, 0],
    "4": [7]
}
```
