Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  40  66  26  45  83   2  17
1  17  58   5  82  57  87  30   9
2  60  26  60  73  25   5  17  12
3  86  14  62  48  35  39  45  13
4  14  24  39  61  53  10  74  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This is an integer programming problem that can be approached by examining the value each agent places on each item and attempting to allocate items in a way that balances those values.

Let's evaluate the optimal allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (83), Item 0 (70), Item 2 (66)
   - Allocate: Item 0 and Item 5

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (87), Item 3 (82)
   - Allocate: Item 3 and Item 4

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (73), Item 0 (60), Item 2 (60)
   - Allocate: Item 6

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (86), Item 2 (62)
   - Allocate: Item 1

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest values: Item 7 (98), Item 6 (74)
   - Allocate: Item 2 and Item 7

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated, with each agent receiving at least one item, and attempts to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
