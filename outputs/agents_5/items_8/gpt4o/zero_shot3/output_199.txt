Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  98  54  36  95  77  36  92
1  33  42  93  46   3  57  58  28
2  91  28  90  37  56  49  79   9
3  11  23  38  84  40  42  15  36
4  76  75  74  97  46  11  11  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all 8 items are allocated. A straightforward way to approach this is by iteratively assigning the highest-valued items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are items 1 (98) and 4 (95).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is item 2 (93).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are items 0 (91) and 2 (90).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is item 3 (84).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is item 3 (97).

Now, let's allocate items to balance the distribution:

- Agent 0: Allocated items 1 and 4 (valuations 98 and 95).
- Agent 1: Allocated item 2 (valuation 93).
- Agent 2: Allocated item 0 (valuation 91).
- Agent 3: Allocated item 3 (valuation 84).
- Agent 4: Allocate remaining items 5, 6, and 7 (valuations 11, 11, and 34).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items, and all 8 items are allocated. Let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
