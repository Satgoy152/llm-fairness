Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  16  30  56  29  45  83  31
1  49  66  61  48  57  43  96  47
2  20   1  41  63  71  14  89  57
3  87  45  93  12  44  33  78  20
4  22  81  75  32  68  50  81  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we can follow a systematic approach to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on the valuations provided. The goal is to assign items such that each agent receives at least one item and the total allocated items remain exactly 8.

Let's break down the allocation process:

1. **Sort Items by Valuation for Each Agent**: For each agent, sort the items based on their valuation in descending order. This will help in prioritizing items for each agent.

2. **Prioritize Allocation**: Begin by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We will try to balance the valuations among agents wherever possible.

3. **Consider Remaining Items**: Once each agent has at least one item, allocate the remaining items to maximize the total value among all agents.

### Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 0 and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 6 and 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 6 and 4.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 2 and 0.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 1 and 6.

Given that item 6 is valued highly by several agents, we need to distribute it carefully. Let's attempt a fair distribution:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4.

### Final Allocations:

Here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items distributed is exactly 8.
