Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24  71  33  84  66  30  52  78
1  18  61  64  35  32  57   2  71
2  13  29  84  33  12  46  34  65
3  69  99  30  41  73   4  59  90
4  23  86  94   7  34  52  50  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly, we need to consider the valuations of each agent and try to maximize the satisfaction across all agents. One common approach is to use a greedy allocation strategy where we iteratively assign items to the agents who value them the most.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:**
   - Item 0: Agent 3 (69)
   - Item 1: Agent 3 (99)
   - Item 2: Agent 4 (94)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (84)
   - Item 4: Agent 3 (73)
   - Item 5: Agent 1 (57)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (52)
   - Item 7: Agent 3 (90)

2. **Allocate items:**
   - Start by allocating items based on the highest valuation.
   - If an agent has multiple highest valuations, allocate one item and then re-evaluate for the next highest valuation for the remaining items.

3. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible:**
   - If an agent is not allocated any item, reassign one from a less critical allocation.

Following this process:

- Agent 0 gets items [3, 6]
- Agent 1 gets item [5]
- Agent 2 gets no items
- Agent 3 gets items [0, 1, 4, 7]
- Agent 4 gets item [2]

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1, 4, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items while fairly considering their valuations.
