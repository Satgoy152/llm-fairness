Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  70  90  64  40  37  64  29  15
1  67   2   1  79  68  12  44  32
2  51  42  82  23  62  34  62  41
3  37  40   7  65  91  88  17  82
4   3  29  46  44  63   0  88  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider how to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We can aim to maximize the sum of values each agent receives from their allocated items. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuation each agent has for any item and allocate those items first.
2. Proceed by allocating remaining items based on the next highest valuations, while ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item or as fairly distributed as possible.

Let's allocate the items based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 1, so we allocate those to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly, allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly, allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly, allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 6 highly, allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
- Agent 3 also has high valuation for item 5, allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 has the next highest valuation for item 7, allocate item 7 to Agent 4.

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item. Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```
