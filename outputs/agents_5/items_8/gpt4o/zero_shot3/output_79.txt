Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  95  16  78  43  51  70  91
1  22  80  27  16   5  83  20  83
2  23  76  84  26  94  47  75  39
3   9  51  34  49  65  12  23  92
4  83  42   9  98  93  79  78  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [22 80 27 16  5 83 20 83]
 [23 76 84 26 94 47 75 39]
 [ 9 51 34 49 65 12 23 92]
 [83 42  9 98 93 79 78 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring every item is allocated and no item is allocated more than once. A simple approach is to allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each item. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation:

1. **Item 0** - Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 90.
2. **Item 1** - Highest valuation is by Agent 0 with a value of 95.
3. **Item 2** - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 84.
4. **Item 3** - Highest valuation is by Agent 4 with a value of 98.
5. **Item 4** - Highest valuation is by Agent 2 with a value of 94.
6. **Item 5** - Highest valuation is by Agent 1 with a value of 83.
7. **Item 6** - Highest valuation is by Agent 4 with a value of 78.
8. **Item 7** - Highest valuation is by Agent 3 with a value of 92.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust allocations if necessary:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 3: Item [7]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 6]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item. Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```
