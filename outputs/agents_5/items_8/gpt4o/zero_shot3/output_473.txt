Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  36  50  87  13  25  86  26
1  91  85  43  37  62   3  85  29
2  93  33  17  64   9  90  79  35
3  36  58  57  16  84  61  53  86
4  82  41  76  66  41  69  38  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [82 41 76 66 41 69 38 12]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use the method of maximizing the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, then adjust to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a reasonable allocation considering the preferences:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (value 93)
   - Item 1: Agent 1 (value 85)
   - Item 2: Agent 4 (value 76)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (value 87)
   - Item 4: Agent 3 (value 84)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (value 90)
   - Item 6: Agent 0 (value 86)
   - Item 7: Agent 3 (value 86)

2. Adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item:
   - Agent 0: Already has items 3 and 6
   - Agent 1: Has item 1
   - Agent 2: Has items 0 and 5
   - Agent 3: Has items 4 and 7
   - Agent 4: Has item 2

Each agent now has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```
