Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  92  61  17  40  32  91  39  60
1  48  98  15  47  23  70  45  35
2  26  93  38  77  57  35   9  27
3  17  95  13  22  69  98   6  65
4  54  99   6  77  53  85  33  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 5 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, as there are 8 items and 5 agents. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. First, let's assign each agent the item that they value the most.
2. After each agent has one item, allocate the remaining items by considering the highest remaining valuations while ensuring no agent receives more than two items until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the most (92), so assign item 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the most (98), so assign item 1.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the most (77), so assign item 3.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the most (98), so assign item 5.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 1 the most (99), but since item 1 is taken, the next best is item 4 (53), so assign item 4.

Now for the remaining items (2, 6, 7):

- **Agent 0**: Item 6 (39) is the highest valued remaining item for any agent, so assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 7 the most of the remaining (35), so assign item 7.
- **Agent 2**: The highest valued remaining item for Agent 2 is item 2 (38), so assign item 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, no agent receives more than two items, and each agent receives at least one item.
