Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  89  98  77   0  21  90  70
1  68  34  68  22  13  41  44  35
2  36  85  11  30  23  23  68  38
3  42  84  98  16  76  20  97  83
4  32  25  30   9  84  99  91  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value received by each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. We can approach this problem by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Looks like Agent 0 highly values items 1 and 2. Allocating these items to Agent 0 would give them a high total value.
2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1 has moderate valuations across items, with the highest value for item 0.
3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 6 highly.
4. **Agent 3:** Agent 3 values item 2 highly, but since item 2 is already allocated to Agent 0, we can allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 5, which hasn't been allocated yet.

Based on these considerations, the allocation can be done as follows:

- Agent 0: [1, 2]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [3, 4, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
