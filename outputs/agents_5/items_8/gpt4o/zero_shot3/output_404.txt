Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  81  71  47  60  56  52  11
1  65  53   8  15  57  73  37  96
2  67   8  23  52  47  96  93   3
3  12   5  86   4  68  93  68   7
4  70  93  34  70  71  84  32   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for all agents, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. A common method for achieving a fair allocation in this context is to use a variation of the "maximum weight matching" in bipartite graphs, where agents are matched to items in a way that maximizes the total valuation.

Let's consider the valuations given and attempt to distribute the items accordingly:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 7.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 5 and 6.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 1.

Given these considerations, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 2
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Items 5 and 6
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Items 1 and 4

This allocation ensures each item is allocated, and the distribution aims to respect the agents' preferences based on the given valuations.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
