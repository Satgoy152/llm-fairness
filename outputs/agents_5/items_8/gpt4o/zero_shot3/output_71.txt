Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  11  66  69  47  62  75  71
1  18  38  95  54  20  50  37  86
2  81  31  51  37  37  68  37  63
3  92  24   5  63  37  96  16  76
4  93  33  80  67   3  81  57  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [93 33 80 67  3 81 57 70]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. We also need to ensure that all 8 items are allocated across the 5 agents. Let's go through a potential allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuations for each item across all agents, and try to allocate items to agents to maximize their total value.

2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, while still maximizing the total value.

Here is one possible allocation based on the table given:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 2
- Agent 2: Items 0
- Agent 3: Items 5
- Agent 4: Items 1, 3, 4

This allocation aims to give each agent a set of items that maximizes their total individual valuation based on the provided table.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
