Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  30  58  91  93  59  15  97  13
1  26  58  35  18  99  94  41  61
2  13   0  92  89  85  66  76  20
3   2  42  27  37  82   9   9  62
4  92  83  46  70  56   4  74   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Here’s a step-by-step approach to achieve a somewhat balanced allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Start by identifying which agent values each item the most.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

3. **Balance the Allocations**: If any agent gets more items than others, attempt to reallocate items to achieve a more balanced distribution while still trying to keep the overall satisfaction high.

Let’s go through the allocation process:

- **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most (92).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 and Agent 1 both value it at 58; however, Agent 0 has fewer high-value items, so give it to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (91).
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most (93).
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (99).
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (94).
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most (97).
- **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most (62).

At this point, Agent 0 has 4 items, Agent 1 has 2 items, and Agents 2, 3, and 4 each have 1 item. To balance the allocation more evenly, let's adjust:

- Reallocate Item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 has the second-highest value (92).
- Reallocate Item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 4, as Agent 4 has a high value for it (70), and they only have 1 item.

Now the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 7
- Agent 4: Items 0, 3

This results in a more balanced distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```
