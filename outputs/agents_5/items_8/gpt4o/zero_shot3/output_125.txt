Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  63   0  46  96   4  56  75
1  73  61  66  87   3  90  67  27
2  30  57  33  66  65  88  84  80
3   0  89  87  81  65  28  56  61
4  63  98  79  86  12   5  96  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we need to consider each agent's preference and attempt to distribute the items to maximize total value for each agent.

Let's start by analyzing the highest valuations per item and allocate them to the agent who values them the most. Here is a potential allocation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it highest at 73.
- **Item 1:** Agent 4 values it highest at 98.
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it highest at 66.
- **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it highest at 87.
- **Item 4:** Agent 0 values it highest at 96.
- **Item 5:** Agent 2 values it highest at 88.
- **Item 6:** Agent 4 values it highest at 96.
- **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it highest at 75.

This allocation maximizes the value each agent receives for the items they value the most. Here is the allocation in the specified json format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
