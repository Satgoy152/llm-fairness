Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  98  87  75  41  74  81  97
1  52  22  97  32  31  59  91  54
2  71  91  59  21  53  35  84  54
3   5  18  85  42  38  49  16  62
4  64  88  70  52  69  51  68  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (since there are 5 agents and 8 items). We'll perform the allocation by examining each agent's valuations and distributing the items such that the total perceived value is maximized across all agents. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 7. We will assign those items to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 2. We will assign that item to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for item 1 (which is already taken) and item 0. We will assign item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** does not have particularly high valuations, but it has the highest for item 3. We will assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 4. We will assign item 4 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we have 3 items left (5, 6, and another high-value item for agent 4 which is 7). We will distribute the remaining items among the agents who have received fewer items so that each agent receives at least one item and the total allocation reaches 8.

- **Agent 1**: Receives an additional item, item 5, due to its next high value for agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Receives item 6, to balance out the number of items and because agent 2 has a relatively high value for item 6.
- **Agent 4**: Receives item 7, which is also valued decently by agent 4.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the number of items among agents while considering their individual valuations.
