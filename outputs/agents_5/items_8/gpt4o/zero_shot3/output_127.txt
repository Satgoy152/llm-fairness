Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  66  21  98  16  71  70  29
1   6   2  80  13  56  67  24  44
2  90  72  72  37  56   7  13  84
3  90  85  98  97   1  67  12  50
4  36  93  38  66  82  14  65  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents. This means each agent should end up with items that they value the most, as much as possible.

Let's consider the allocation step by step:

1. Start by allocating items to agents based on their highest value for each item.
2. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.
3. Balance the allocation if possible to ensure fairness.

Here's a potential allocation based on the values provided:

- Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 90).
- Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 93).
- Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value 98).
- Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 98).
- Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value 82).
- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 71).
- Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 70).
- Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 84).

This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction based on the highest values each agent places on certain items while distributing all items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
