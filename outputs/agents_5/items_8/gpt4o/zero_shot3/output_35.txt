Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20   4  31  82  84   8  97  73
1  54  99  31  22   2  91  62  49
2   2  67  68   4  39   5   5  58
3  85  42  41  53  49  91  23  84
4  52  72   3  83  83   9  66  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share of the total value according to their preferences.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 6 (97) and item 3 (82). Let's allocate these items to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 1 (99) and item 5 (91). Let's allocate these items to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 2 (68) and item 7 (58). Let's allocate these items to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 0 (85). Let's allocate this item to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 4 (83) highly. Let's allocate this item to agent 4.

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.
