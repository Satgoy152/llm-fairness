Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  54  92  31  95  95  95  67
1  96  17  35  51  88  86  15  11
2  20  45   9  33  30  92  24  43
3  52  70  22  51  68  47  11  16
4  75  84  17  70  48  14  89  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm. The goal is to maximize the valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

To start, we will allocate the highest valued item to each agent, ensuring all agents have at least one item. After that, we will allocate the remaining items to maximize the total valuation of items for each agent.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value is 95 (Items 4, 5, 6)
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value is 96 (Item 0)
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value is 92 (Item 5)
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value is 70 (Item 1)
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value is 89 (Item 6)

Now, allocate these items:
- Agent 0: Allocated item 4 (value 95)
- Agent 1: Allocated item 0 (value 96)
- Agent 2: Allocated item 5 (value 92)
- Agent 3: Allocated item 1 (value 70)
- Agent 4: Allocated item 6 (value 89)

Remaining items: [2, 3, 7]

Next, allocate the remaining items based on the highest available valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Highest remaining value for items [2, 3, 7] is 92 for item 2
- **Agent 4**: Highest remaining value for items [3, 7] is 63 for item 7
- **Agent 3**: Remaining item 3, valuation 51

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [4, 2]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [1, 3]
- Agent 4: [6, 7]

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```
