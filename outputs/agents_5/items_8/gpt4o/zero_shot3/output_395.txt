Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  91  24  58  59  47  26  76
1  17  72  99  25  44  40  59  72
2  18  74  80  86  27  92  89  22
3   1  40  97  78  85  24  79  66
4  95  73  32  67  91  73  82  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Each agent should end up with at least one item, and all items should be allocated.

Let's analyze the highest values each agent has for the items and try to distribute them accordingly. We also need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item while maximizing their total value.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 1 (91), Item 7 (76)
   - Allocate Item 1 and Item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 2 (99), Item 7 (72)
   - Item 7 is already allocated, so allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 5 (92), Item 6 (89)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 2 (97), Item 4 (85)
   - Item 2 is already allocated, allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 0 (95), Item 4 (91)
   - Item 4 is already allocated, allocate Item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (3 and 6):

- **Remaining items**: 3, 6
- **Current allocations**: Agent 0 has 2 items, Agents 1, 2, 3, and 4 each have 1 item.

Allocate the remaining items to agents with fewer items to balance the distribution:

1. Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 has only 1 item).
2. Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 has only 1 item).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, each agent has at least one item, and the distribution attempts to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.
