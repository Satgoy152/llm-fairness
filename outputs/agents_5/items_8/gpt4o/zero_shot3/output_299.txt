Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  25  61  78  95  31  57  23  31
1  33  35   8  54  85  58  34   3
2  94  43  85  54  53  60  29  25
3  27  47  69  30  66  23  74  77
4  85  52  78  56  34  86  54   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations for each agent and item:

1. Agent 0: [25, 61, 78, 95, 31, 57, 23, 31]
2. Agent 1: [33, 35, 8, 54, 85, 58, 34, 3]
3. Agent 2: [94, 43, 85, 54, 53, 60, 29, 25]
4. Agent 3: [27, 47, 69, 30, 66, 23, 74, 77]
5. Agent 4: [85, 52, 78, 56, 34, 86, 54, 3]

We'll allocate the items by considering each agent's highest-valued items:

1. **Agent 0** has a highest valuation of 95 for item 3.
2. **Agent 1** has a highest valuation of 85 for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has a highest valuation of 94 for item 0.
4. **Agent 3** has a highest valuation of 77 for item 7.
5. **Agent 4** has a highest valuation of 86 for item 5.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 2's second-highest valuation is 85 for item 2.
- Agent 4's second-highest valuation is 78 for item 2, but it is already considered so we look for another highest.
- Agent 0's second-highest valuation is 78 for item 2, but it is already considered so we look for another highest.
- Agent 3's second-highest valuation is 74 for item 6.
- Agent 4's third-highest valuation is 78 for item 2, but it is already considered so we look for another highest.
- Agent 1's second-highest valuation is 58 for item 5, but it is already considered so we look for another highest.
- Agent 0's third-highest valuation is 78 for item 2, but it is already considered so we look for another highest.
- Agent 0's fourth-highest valuation is 61 for item 1.

Now we have allocated the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [3, 1]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0, 2]
- Agent 3: [7, 6]
- Agent 4: [5]

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed based on the highest valuations for each agent.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [7, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```
