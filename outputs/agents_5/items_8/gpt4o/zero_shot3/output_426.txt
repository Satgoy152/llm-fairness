Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  42  92  42  38  26  90   8   5
1  88  57  63  65  82  61  41  58
2  70  78  69  69  61  15  16  71
3  51  82  90  33  17  41  97  61
4   5  80   7  97  27   2  62  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

First, let's examine the valuation matrix for each agent:

- Agent 0: [42, 92, 42, 38, 26, 90, 8, 5]
- Agent 1: [88, 57, 63, 65, 82, 61, 41, 58]
- Agent 2: [70, 78, 69, 69, 61, 15, 16, 71]
- Agent 3: [51, 82, 90, 33, 17, 41, 97, 61]
- Agent 4: [5, 80, 7, 97, 27, 2, 62, 41]

We will start by identifying the highest value for each item and assign the item to the agent with the highest value for that item, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

1. Item 0: Agent 1 has the highest value (88).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 has the highest value (92).
3. Item 2: Agent 3 has the highest value (90).
4. Item 3: Agent 4 has the highest value (97).
5. Item 4: Agent 1 has the highest value (82).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 has the highest value (90).
7. Item 6: Agent 3 has the highest value (97).
8. Item 7: Agent 2 has the highest value (71).

Based on the above allocations, let's assign the items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Items 2, 6
- Agent 4: Item 3

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
