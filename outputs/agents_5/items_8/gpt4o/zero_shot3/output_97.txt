Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  14   5  42  55  62   2  54
1  74   6  85  86  34  98  41  93
2  75  35   9  11  47  62  88  53
3  95  89  68  48  48  60  58  19
4  20   6  36  95  39   2  77  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of the items. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has relatively lower valuations across the board, so we can allocate items with lower value to them.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for several items, notably items 2, 3, 5, and 7.
3. **Agent 2** has a notable valuation for item 6.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations generally, but particularly for item 0 and 1.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 3 and 7.

Let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0: [0, 1]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4, 7]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, given the constraints.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
