Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  69  48  82  15  95  90  50
1  37  29  45   0  82  21  81  87
2  95  17  56  57  27  77  92  77
3  19  63  51   2  67  16  19  28
4  60  15  44  23  76  61  56  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Best items based on value: 5 (95), 6 (90)
   - Allocation: [5, 6]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Best items based on value: 7 (87), 4 (82)
   - Allocation: [7, 4]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Best items based on value: 0 (95), 2 (56)
   - Allocation: [0, 2]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Best item based on value: 1 (63)
   - Allocation: [1]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Best item based on value: 3 (23)
   - Allocation: [3]

This ensures that all items are allocated, with each agent receiving a reasonable number of items based on their valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [7, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
