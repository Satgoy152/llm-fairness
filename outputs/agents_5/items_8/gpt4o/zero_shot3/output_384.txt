Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  79  32  93  39  16  48  40   8
1  67  83  75  27  12  14  58  54
2  94  18  20  49   8  64   1  49
3  42  31  21  82  31  23  97  30
4  15  76  86  72  31  65  25  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to allocate items to agents in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. One possible method is the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where each agent gets a turn to pick their highest-valued item that hasn't been picked yet.

Let's go through a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Picks item 2 (value 93).
2. **Agent 1**: Picks item 1 (value 83).
3. **Agent 2**: Picks item 0 (value 94).
4. **Agent 3**: Picks item 6 (value 97).
5. **Agent 4**: Picks item 2, but it's already taken, so picks item 2nd highest value item 2 (value 86).
6. **Agent 0**: Picks item 3 (value 39).
7. **Agent 1**: Picks item 7 (value 54).
8. **Agent 2**: Picks item 5 (value 64).

Now each agent has at least one item, and all 8 items have been allocated. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
