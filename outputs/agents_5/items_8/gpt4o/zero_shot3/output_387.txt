Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  77   0  56  51  99  61  74
1  51  58  46  95  23  14  87  87
2  63  62  26  86  96  19  13  63
3   6  56  86  31  25  20  44  79
4  46  65  19  84   8   9  67  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while attempting to balance the distribution. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuations**: First, we'll identify which items each agent values the most, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

2. **Allocate Items**: We'll then allocate items based on these maximum valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

3. **Balance Items**: If any agent receives no items, we'll reallocate to ensure fairness, considering the overall valuation each agent can achieve.

Here's the allocation process:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (99), so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (95), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (96), so allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (86), so allocate item 2 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 7 the highest (82), so allocate item 7 to agent 4.

After these allocations, each agent has one item. We have 3 items left: 0, 1, 6.

Allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 has item 5. They value item 1 next highest (77), so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 has item 3. They value item 6 next highest (87), so allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has item 4. They value item 0 next highest (63), so allocate item 0 to agent 2.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [5, 1]
- Agent 1: [3, 6]
- Agent 2: [4, 0]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [7]

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7]
}
```
This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their individual valuations to the extent possible.
