Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  41  16  16  47  91  33  27  13
1  96  26  91  39  27  55  11  43
2   1  40  41  10  68  34  13  55
3  12  11   3  86  41   5  35  40
4  50  16  15   1  22  18  60  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [50 16 15  1 22 18 60 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total satisfaction or utility for the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, we can assign either 1 or 2 items to each agent, ensuring that all 8 items are allocated.

One approach is to assign the items based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Assign to agent 1 (96)
2. **Item 1**: Assign to agent 2 (40)
3. **Item 2**: Assign to agent 1 (91)
4. **Item 3**: Assign to agent 3 (86)
5. **Item 4**: Assign to agent 0 (91)
6. **Item 5**: Assign to agent 2 (34)
7. **Item 6**: Assign to agent 4 (60)
8. **Item 7**: Assign to agent 4 (83)

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```
