Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  11  75  47  37  20  28  61
1  36  68  78  14  57  88  81  40
2  20  36  43  95  64  77   0   8
3  79  41  90  23  42  66  93  82
4  22  84  76  24  60  67  86  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. We can use a simple approach, iterating through agents and assigning them the highest-valued items still available.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. Assign the highest-valued item available to each agent sequentially.
2. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

**Allocation Process:**

- Agent 0: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 2 (value = 75). Assign item 2.
- Agent 1: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 5 (value = 88). Assign item 5.
- Agent 2: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 3 (value = 95). Assign item 3.
- Agent 3: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 6 (value = 93). Assign item 6.
- Agent 4: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 7 (value = 94). Assign item 7.
- Remaining items: 0, 1, 4

Continuing in this way to maximize individual agent satisfaction:

- Agent 0: The next highest value item for Agent 0 among unallocated items is item 0 (value = 71). Assign item 0.
- Agent 1: The next highest value item for Agent 1 among unallocated items is item 4 (value = 57). Assign item 4.
- Agent 2: The next highest value item for Agent 2 among unallocated items is item 1 (value = 36). Assign item 1.

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [3, 1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives items with high valuations according to their preferences.
