Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  50  33  42  51   7   5  65
1  71  10  21  60  68  82  34   6
2  28  45  13   4  29   3  46  39
3  37  83  88  78  25  79  40  44
4  76  40  49  56  47  48  67   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives by assigning items in such a way that each agent's high-value items are considered. We need to ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here’s a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: We observe that Agent 0 values item 7 the highest (65).
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest value for item 5 (82).
3. **Agent 2**: For Agent 2, item 6 has the highest value (46).
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 2 (88).
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (76).

Next, we allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest values for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: After item 7, item 4 is also valued highly by Agent 0 (51).
- **Agent 1**: After item 5, Agent 1 values item 0 (71).
- **Agent 2**: After item 6, Agent 2 can take item 3 (4), since the higher valued items are already taken by others.
- **Agent 3**: After item 2, Agent 3 highly values item 1 (83).
- **Agent 4**: After item 0, Agent 4 values item 3 (56), but since it is already assigned, they get item 1 (40).

Thus, ensuring that all items are allocated and no agent receives more than a fair share, here’s a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a share of items that considers their valuations while also distributing all items.
