Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  41  93  58  25   4  37  53
1  67  62  24  91  33  76  52  34
2  34  15   8  81   0  88  25  39
3  20   3  63  20  86  53  85  51
4  41  84  43  19   6  77  50  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's approach this by considering the value each agent assigns to each item and try to maximize the total value each agent receives, distributing items as equitably as possible based on their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 2 (93) and 3 (58).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 0 (67) and 5 (76).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 5 (88) and 3 (81), but since item 5 is already allocated, we'll assign item 6 (25).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 4 (86) and 6 (85), but since item 6 is already allocated, we'll assign item 7 (51).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers items 1 (84) and 7 (87), but since item 7 is already allocated, we'll assign item 1 (84).

After considering the above preferences and ensuring each item is only allocated once, here is the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents, maximizing their individual valuations as much as possible given the constraints.
