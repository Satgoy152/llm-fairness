Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  52  77  94  15  46  65   4
1  14  15  94  51  81   6   5  17
2  95  43  82  69  49  77  43  50
3  55  86  34  94  13  14   9  18
4  90  22  55  14  60   8  39  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value higher, if possible. Each agent should receive an integer number of items, and since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

Let's go through a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (94), then item 2 (77).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (94), but item 2 is already taken by Agent 0, so the next highest is item 4 (81).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (95).
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (94), but item 3 is already taken by Agent 0, so the next highest is item 1 (86).
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (90), but item 0 is already taken by Agent 2, so the next highest is item 7 (68).

Since we need to allocate all 8 items, let's adjust for fairness, making sure to shuffle items to unassigned agents:

- Agent 0: [2, 3] (high valuation on both)
- Agent 1: [4, 6] (next highest available valuations)
- Agent 2: [0] (highest valuation)
- Agent 3: [1] (next highest available after 3)
- Agent 4: [5, 7] (remaining items)

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value relatively highly while ensuring all items are distributed. The allocations are balanced, with Agent 0 and 1 receiving two items due to their initial high valuations.

Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```
