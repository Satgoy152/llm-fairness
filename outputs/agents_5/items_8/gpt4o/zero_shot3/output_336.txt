Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  71  83  54  73  48  88  29
1   1  37  87  21  11  32  58   6
2  36  76  54   7  82  49  70  49
3   4  54  72  83  87  20   6   6
4  94  33  32   9  16  20  63  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their preferences. The goal is to maximize satisfaction or balance the perceived value across agents.

Here's a possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 6 (value 88)
   - Item 2 (value 83)
   - Total value = 171

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3 (value 21)
   - Item 5 (value 32)
   - Total value = 53

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 (value 82)
   - Item 0 (value 36)
   - Total value = 118

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 7 (value 6)
   - Total value = 6

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 1 (value 33)
   - Total value = 33

This allocation attempts to balance the values received by each agent. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 0],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
