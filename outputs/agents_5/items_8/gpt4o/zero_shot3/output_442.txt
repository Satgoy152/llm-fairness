Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  40  24  18  32  39  66  91
1  87  37   1  13  38  23  60  46
2  36  57  47  24  98   5  15  65
3  86  48  41  16  27  31  38  33
4  77  35  40  30  61  20  95   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We can start by giving each agent the item they value the most, then continue to allocate items based on the highest remaining valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a strategic approach:

1. Identify the item each agent values the most and allocate those items first.
2. Continue allocating the remaining items to agents based on the next highest valuations while ensuring no more than 8 items are allocated in total.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value 98).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value 87), but it's already taken, so we consider the next highest value, which is item 6 (value 60).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most (value 98).
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (value 86), but it's already taken, so we consider the next highest value, which is item 1 (value 48).
5. Agent 4 values item 6 the most (value 95), but it's already taken, so we consider the next highest value, which is item 0 (value 77), but it's already taken, so we consider item 4 (value 61), but it's already taken, so we consider item 2 (value 40).

Now, we have allocated 5 items. Let's allocate the remaining items based on the next highest available values:

6. Agent 0 might get item 7 (value 91).
7. Agent 1 might get item 5 (value 23).
8. Agent 3 might get item 3 (value 16).

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This way, all 8 items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing their individual valuations.
