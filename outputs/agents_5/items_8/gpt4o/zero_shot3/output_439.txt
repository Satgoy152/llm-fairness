Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  45  18  42  59  47  65  32  91
1   1  83  50  91  32   3  46  28
2  89  73  84  78  99  67  95   8
3  79  64  11  46  54  44  26  15
4  55  47  29  78  87  26  83  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach by trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given that we have 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 has relatively high valuations for items 3 and 5.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most.
3. Agent 2 should receive item 4 as it's their highest value.
4. Agent 3 can get items 0 and 2, which are among their highest.
5. Agent 4 values items 6 and 7 highly.

Based on this reasoning, a potential allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 4 gets items 6 and 7.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are given out, with some agents receiving more items due to their preferences and valuation strengths.
