Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  97  12  41   8  72  33  70
1  85  33  97  26  47  10  35  48
2  69  19  34  13  39  42  66  63
3  18  30  44  31  13  64  93  58
4  75  66  77  63  45  39  39  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations. 

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.** 
2. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible.**
3. **Balance the total number of items, ensuring each agent's allocation is as close to others' as possible.**

Let's go through the items based on the highest valuation:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it the most (85).
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it the most (97).
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it the most (97).
- **Item 3:** Agent 0 values it the most (41).
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it the most (47).
- **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the most (72).
- **Item 6:** Agent 3 values it the most (93).
- **Item 7:** Agent 0 values it the most (70).

Now, let's distribute these based on the valuations:

- **Agent 0:** Item 1, Item 3, Item 5, Item 7
- **Agent 1:** Item 0, Item 2, Item 4
- **Agent 3:** Item 6

Agent 2 and Agent 4 will receive no items based on the highest valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5, 7],
    "1": [0, 2, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [6],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed, with each item going to the agent who values it the most.
