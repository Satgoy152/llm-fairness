Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  20  60  30  69  42  36  13
1  26  11  77   0  95  84   7  25
2  13  46   1  20   7  43  76  83
3  15  10  24  50  61  85  50  98
4  68  15  78  27  67  40  59   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[11 20 60 30 69 42 36 13]
 [26 11 77  0 95 84  7 25]
 [13 46  1 20  7 43 76 83]
 [15 10 24 50 61 85 50 98]
 [68 15 78 27 67 40 59  6]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to assign items in a way that maximizes the total utility for each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair share. Given the valuations, one approach is to allocate items to agents based on their highest preferences, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. 

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (69).
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (95).
3. Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (83).
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the highest (98).
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (78).

To ensure fairness, let's iterate through agents and allocate their highest value items while trying to avoid conflicts. If conflicts occur (such as multiple agents wanting the same item), we will try to allocate the second-highest item or adjust based on fairness:

1. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
2. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 (highest valuation).
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4 (highest valuation).
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0 (second-highest valuation for Agent 0).
5. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (second-highest valuation for Agent 2).

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (0, 1, and 3):

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (11) as they have a lower total value so far.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (15) to balance the items.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3 (50) as they have a lower total value so far.

Finally, ensure only 8 items are allocated and update the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items in a relatively fair manner based on their preferences, ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share.
