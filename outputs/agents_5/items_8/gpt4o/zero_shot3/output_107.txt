Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  40   2  10  39  86  33  51
1  44   7  77  44  98  35  87  22
2  22  72  61  51  97  78  79   2
3  91  23   6  82  89  29   9   2
4  17  96  47  99  40  79  48   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44  7 77 44 98 35 87 22]
 [22 72 61 51 97 78 79  2]
 [91 23  6 82 89 29  9  2]
 [17 96 47 99 40 79 48  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their preferences. Since there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We will consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a manner that seems equitable based on the given preferences.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Receives items that they value relatively higher compared to others.
- Agent 1: Receives items where they have a comparative advantage in valuation.
- Agent 2: Focuses on items with higher valuations.
- Agent 3: Allocates items that maximize their value.
- Agent 4: Assigns items that are valued higher by them.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 7]
- Agent 1: [4, 2]
- Agent 2: [5, 6]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item except for Agent 3 who ends up with one item that they value significantly.

Now, presenting the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
