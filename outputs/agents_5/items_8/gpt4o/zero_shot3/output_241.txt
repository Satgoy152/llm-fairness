Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  21  86  48  64  50  85  55
1  42  50   1  64  42  19  78   4
2  16  49  79  95   0  90  91  16
3  44  98  20   2  87  65  87   8
4  24  14  49  66  69  31  48  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every item is only assigned to one agent and all items are distributed.

We have 8 items and 5 agents, so one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. Let's go through the valuations to determine a fair allocation.

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (86) and 6 (85).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (64).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 6 (91) and 3 (95).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (98) and 4 (87).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (69) and 3 (66).

By examining these, we need a strategy to maximize each agent’s total value while ensuring each item is assigned once. 

### Allocation Strategy
- Give Agent 3 the item 1 (value 98), which is their highest value and prevents conflict with Agent 4, who also values item 4.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 as well, since it is their second-highest and no conflict arises.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valuation and one of the top valued items overall.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as it’s their top choice.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it’s their highest valuation.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as it’s their next highest after 2 and 6 are taken.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4, which is a high value for them without conflict.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as it is one of the remaining items.

### Final Allocation
Let's now write down the allocations in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items distributed is exactly 8.
