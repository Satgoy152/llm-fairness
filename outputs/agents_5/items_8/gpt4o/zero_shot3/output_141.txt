Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  23  17  32  16  57   1  16
1  89   2  18  79  98  75  64  99
2  83  82  70  28  45  10  16  72
3  16   1  16  61  68  96  94   2
4  95   0   2  93  35   3  77  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items in a way that each agent is given items they value the most, while trying to ensure the total allocation is fair.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most with 57, so they get item 5.
- Agent 1 values item 7 the most with 99, so they get item 7.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most with 83, so they get item 0.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most with 96, but it's already taken. Instead, they can get item 6 with 94.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most with 95, but it's already taken. Instead, they can get item 3 with 93.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 1 is left. Agent 2 values it the second most (82), so they get item 1.
- Item 2 is left. Agent 2 values it the third most (70), so they get item 2.
- Item 4 is left. Agent 4 values it the second most (35), so they get item 4.

After this allocation, each agent gets:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [3, 4]

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 1, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
