Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59   3  83  88  93  81   1  19
1  70  14  92  81  16  95  55  27
2  37  97  27  87   6  95   7  24
3  69  86  84  34  27  99   5  94
4  98  81  23   6  65  78  68  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's highest-valued items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. This is a simple approach that tries to maximize individual satisfaction based on the provided valuations.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item first.
2. Reallocate any remaining items to agents based on their next highest valuations.

Here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (value 93)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (value 95)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (value 97)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (value 5)
- Agent 4: Item 0 (value 98)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:
- Item 2: Assign to Agent 3 (value 84)
- Item 3: Assign to Agent 0 (value 88)
- Item 7: Assign to Agent 1 (value 27)

These allocations ensure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are assigned.

Now, here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6, 2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
