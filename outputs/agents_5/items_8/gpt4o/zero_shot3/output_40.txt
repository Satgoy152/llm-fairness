Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  38  18  93  88  49  63  10
1  16  82  50  78  42  83  72   4
2  55  20  54  53  71  70  57  75
3  47   2  59  53  43  44  25  73
4  96  38  32  11   4  15  31  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's first sum up the total valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0: 8 + 38 + 18 + 93 + 88 + 49 + 63 + 10 = 367
- Agent 1: 16 + 82 + 50 + 78 + 42 + 83 + 72 + 4 = 427
- Agent 2: 55 + 20 + 54 + 53 + 71 + 70 + 57 + 75 = 455
- Agent 3: 47 + 2 + 59 + 53 + 43 + 44 + 25 + 73 = 346
- Agent 4: 96 + 38 + 32 + 11 + 4 + 15 + 31 + 84 = 311

Next, we will allocate the items to maximize the individual agents' valuations based on their preferences:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 as it has the highest value (93).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 as it has the second-highest value (83).
3. Assign item 7 to Agent 4 as it has a high value (84).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 4 as it has the highest value (96).
5. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 as it has a high value (82).
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 as it has a high value (71).
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 as it has a high value (57).
8. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 as it has a high value (59).

Now let's ensure that each agent has an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [4, 6]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [0, 7]

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed amongst the agents while aiming for a fair distribution.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```
