Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  21  86  81  43   6  17  18
1  48  64  37   5  52  11  42  45
2   3  34  57  15  79  61  41   6
3  19  64  41  83  47  58  24  59
4  74  73  71   6  55  64  83  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's consider the valuations given:

```
0: [44, 21, 86, 81, 43, 6, 17, 18]
1: [48, 64, 37, 5, 52, 11, 42, 45]
2: [3, 34, 57, 15, 79, 61, 41, 6]
3: [19, 64, 41, 83, 47, 58, 24, 59]
4: [74, 73, 71, 6, 55, 64, 83, 38]
```

We'll attempt to distribute the items while maximizing the total valuation for each agent, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highest (86).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 highest (64).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highest (79).
4. Agent 3 values item 3 highest (83).
5. Agent 4 values item 6 highest (83).

Having each agent get their highest valued item, we have:

- Agent 0: item 2
- Agent 1: item 1
- Agent 2: item 4
- Agent 3: item 3
- Agent 4: item 6

Next, allocate remaining items 0, 5, and 7:

- Agent 4 also values item 0 highly (74), so assign item 0 to Agent 4.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly (61), so assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 7 highly (59), so assign item 7 to Agent 3.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [6, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all items are distributed based on maximizing valuations.
