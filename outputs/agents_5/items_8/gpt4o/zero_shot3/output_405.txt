Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  43  78  83  30  98  64  78
1  23  25  25  63  90  16  60  19
2  57  62   8  94  21  64  53  19
3  97  97  80  80  79  82  88  42
4  93  21  81  27  71  93  27  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share of items. Given there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. 

Let's analyze and allocate the items based on the highest valuation each agent has for the items:

1. **Item Allocation Strategy:**
   - Prioritize giving each agent the item they value the most.
   - If two agents value an item equally, consider the next highest valuation as a tiebreaker.
   - Ensure all 8 items are allocated, with no item going unallocated.

2. **Allocation Process:**
   - Look for the highest value each agent places on any item and allocate it to them if it has not already been allocated.
   - Repeat until all items are assigned.

**Allocation:**

- Agent 0: Items [5] (98 is the maximum value that agent 0 assigns to any item)
- Agent 1: Items [4] (90 is the maximum value that agent 1 assigns to any item)
- Agent 2: Items [3] (94 is the maximum value that agent 2 assigns to any item)
- Agent 3: Items [0, 1] (97 is the maximum value that agent 3 assigns to items 0 and 1)
- Agent 4: Items [2, 6, 7] (81, 93, and 55 are the highest remaining values)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and all items are allocated fairly among the agents.

**JSON Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [2, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation strategy maximizes the total value for each agent based on their highest preferences for the items.
