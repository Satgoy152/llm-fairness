Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  33  33  41  70  98  35  56
1  65  17  95  85  45  30  17  43
2  61  77  75  77  43  28  70  73
3  88  98  71  95  95  24  20  28
4  24  40  10  86  45  93  94  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. We will try to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item and assign the item to the corresponding agent.
2. If an agent ends up with more than two items, we may need to adjust to ensure a fair distribution, as there are 8 items and 5 agents.

Following the above strategy:

- Item 0 is most valued by agent 3 (88).
- Item 1 is most valued by agent 3 (98).
- Item 2 is most valued by agent 1 (95).
- Item 3 is most valued by agent 3 (95).
- Item 4 is most valued by agent 0 (70).
- Item 5 is most valued by agent 0 (98).
- Item 6 is most valued by agent 4 (94).
- Item 7 is most valued by agent 0 (56).

Let's make sure each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 5, 7]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: (No items)
- Agent 3: Items [0, 1, 3]
- Agent 4: Item [6]

Now, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1, 3],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent's allocation is integer-based.
