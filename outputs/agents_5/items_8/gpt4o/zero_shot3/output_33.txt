Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  18  12   6  54  12  13  99
1  77  81  90  79  40  26  60  19
2  98  83   4   2  63  54   5  35
3  75  18  87  72  15  19  72  99
4  21  24  81  78  21   8  21  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated.

Let's start by prioritizing the highest valuations for each item and ensuring every agent receives at least one item where possible:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (88), Item 7 (99)
   - Assign Item 0 and Item 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (90), Item 1 (81)
   - Assign Item 2 and Item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (98), Item 4 (63)
   - Item 0 is already allocated, so assign Item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (99), Item 2 (87)
   - Both items 7 and 2 are already allocated, so assign Item 3 (72) to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (81), Item 3 (78)
   - Both items 2 and 3 are already allocated, so assign Item 5 (8) and Item 6 (21) to Agent 4.

Now let's summarize the allocations as requested:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.
