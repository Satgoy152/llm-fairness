Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  34  76   4  41  71  12   5
1  61  91  41  80  43  61  43  60
2  49  57  14   0  34  15  72  18
3  80  33  58  29  59  49  42  55
4  69  17  72  23  68  21  41  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[36 34 76  4 41 71 12  5]
 [61 91 41 80 43 61 43 60]
 [49 57 14  0 34 15 72 18]
 [80 33 58 29 59 49 42 55]
 [69 17 72 23 68 21 41 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we need to make sure each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed. Let's consider a strategy that tries to distribute items based on maximizing the agents' satisfaction with their allocations. 

Here is a possible fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 5
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Items 4, 7

This allocation considers agents' preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
