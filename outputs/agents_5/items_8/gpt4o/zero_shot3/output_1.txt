Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  96  24  37  60  17  29  81  63
1  71  52  83  29  39  99  85  41
2  39  74  42  92  73  33  65  54
3  96  75  50  54   5  25  69  78
4  59  86  40  26  38  63  71  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim for a distribution that maximizes the satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one of their higher valued items.
3. Allocate remaining items to maximize total value across all agents.
4. Ensure that all items are allocated.

Given the table and the constraints, let's assign the items:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 0 very highly, but it's already allocated, so we look at item 7.
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly.

After this initial assignment, we see that:

- Items 2, 4, and 6 are still unallocated.

Now, let's optimize the remaining allocations based on the next highest valuations:

- Agent 0 can take item 2.
- Agent 1 can take item 6.
- Agent 4 can take item 4.

This results in the following fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair distribution of the items based on their valuations, while all items are allocated.
