Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  29  64  58  61  77  23  60
1  48  87  99  13  64  25   7  37
2  26  50  64  23  33  98  15  89
3  51   9  86  49  79  18  56  35
4  50   2  38  79  83  74  86  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items amongst the agents, we aim for a balanced distribution that considers the agents' valuations. There are 8 items and 5 agents, so not every agent will receive the same number of items. One approach is to try to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's highest valued items.

Here's a suggested allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign items based on maximizing their valuations where possible.
- Agent 1: Assign items where they have significantly higher valuations.
- Agent 2: Continue with the same pattern for the remaining agents.
- Agent 3: Ensure each agent gets at least one item where possible.
- Agent 4: Distribute remaining items considering their highest values.

Considering these principles, here is a potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation strives to give each agent at least one item and attempts to match higher valuations to the agents' preferences where possible, within the limits of the table provided.
