Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11   1  57  31  79   8  15  85
1  63  99  75  51  14   5  49  52
2  26  74  30  10  62  12  46  10
3  28  21  68  16  97  96  35  68
4  41  52  18  72  53  40  64  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of the items. Hereâ€™s one way to do it based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, taking care to ensure that all agents receive at least one item and that no agent receives a disproportionate number of items.

2. Ensure that the total number of items allocated across all agents is exactly 8.

Based on this approach, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 7 (value 85)
- Agent 1: Items 1 (value 99)
- Agent 2: Items 4 (value 62)
- Agent 3: Items 5 (value 96)
- Agent 4: Items 3 (value 72), 0 (value 41), 2 (value 18), 6 (value 64)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items is 8.

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 0, 2, 6]
}
```
