Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  53  95  64  64  54  30  95  51
1  19  87  54   5  23   4  35  79
2  62  17   7  70  86  42  87   3
3   3  43  41  26  22  90  97  61
4  90  33  32  94   9  15  18  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items they value highly, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (where possible) and that the total number of allocated items is exactly 8.

Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring no agent receives more than their fair share initially.

2. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:**
   - If any items remain unallocated or if some agents have not received any items, adjust the allocations to distribute items fairly.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation:**
   - Item 0: Agent 4 (90)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (95)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (64)
   - Item 3: Agent 4 (94)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (86)
   - Item 5: Agent 3 (90)
   - Item 6: Agent 3 (97)
   - Item 7: Agent 1 (79)

2. **Reallocate to Ensure Fair Distribution:**
   - Agent 0 has 2 items, Agent 1 has 1 item, Agent 2 has 1 item, Agent 3 has 2 items, and Agent 4 has 2 items. This distribution uses all 8 items, and each agent, except Agent 2, receives at least one item.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated and the distribution is as fair as possible given the valuation matrix.
