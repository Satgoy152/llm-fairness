Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  73  47  51  83  84  63   2
1  10  85  54  25   8  30  56  73
2  11  40  32  32  76  53  65  82
3  48  44  55  64  96  28  31  50
4  51  96  41  74  89  35  38  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. Hereâ€™s a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Initial Allocation Strategy**: Distribute items based on the highest valuations to ensure fairness and maximize utility:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

2. **Balanced Allocation**: Adjust the allocation to ensure that no agent is left out, and each agent receives items proportional to their valuations.

### Allocation Steps:

- **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most (51).
- **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most (96).
- **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the most (55).
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most (64).
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the most (96).
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most (84).
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most (65).
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most (82).

### Allocation Adjustments:

- Ensure each agent has at least one item:
  - Agent 0: [5]
  - Agent 1: [7]
  - Agent 2: [6]
  - Agent 3: [2, 3, 4]
  - Agent 4: [0, 1]

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 3, 4],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, optimizing based on the given valuations.
