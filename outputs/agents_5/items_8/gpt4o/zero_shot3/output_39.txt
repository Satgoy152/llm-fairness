Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  67  62  53  67  24  31  99  94
1  78  63  98  80  94  44  91  94
2  32  24  14  95  48  59   4  80
3  46  79  75  66  30  13  56  81
4  54  86  60  37  93  80  27  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's value from the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. A simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest value each agent has for a particular item, avoiding any overlap in assignments.

Here's a possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If an agent is assigned too many items, reassign some items to agents with the next highest valuations until each agent has a fair number of items.

Let's determine the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the highest at 78.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the highest at 86.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest at 98.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 95.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the highest at 93.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the highest at 80.
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the highest at 99.
- Item 7: Agent 1 and Agent 0 both value it at 94, but Agent 1 already has several items, so assign it to Agent 0.

Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents while considering their highest valuations for each item.
