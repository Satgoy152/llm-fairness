Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19   1  88   3  85  32  51  24
1  73  24  97  84  86  25  30  89
2  37  75  85  68  98  11   1  18
3   5  93  40  40  55  35  21   9
4  77  45  71   9  16  28   0  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their given valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are allocated. One way to approach this problem is to use a greedy strategy where we allocate items to agents based on who values them the most.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. First, compile a list of all items and their valuations by each agent.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on the valuation.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Following this strategy, here's a potential allocation:

- Item 4: Agent 2 (value 98)
- Item 2: Agent 1 (value 97)
- Item 1: Agent 3 (value 93)
- Item 7: Agent 1 (value 89)
- Item 0: Agent 1 (value 73)
- Item 3: Agent 1 (value 84)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (value 32)
- Item 6: Agent 0 (value 51)

Now, ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0 receives items 5, 6
- Agent 1 receives items 0, 2, 3, 7
- Agent 2 receives item 4
- Agent 3 receives item 1
- Agent 4 receives no items

Based on this allocation, here's the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2, 3, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation respects the condition that all 8 items are distributed among the agents while trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
