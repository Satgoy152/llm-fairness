Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   3  56  40  80  51  47  49  57
1  85   7  75  34  56  85  89  20
2  10  77  94  38  10  62  84  49
3  22  22  19   4  67  32  75  49
4  60  75  49  96  98  71  24  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider the valuations provided and aim to balance the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and try a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (80).
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most (89).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the most (94).
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the most (67).
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest, but since it's already chosen for Agent 3, we'll consider item 3 (96), which is also high.

By prioritizing the highest valued items for each agent while balancing the distribution, we can formulate the following allocation:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 1, 7) in a way that tries to equalize total valuations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (who has fewer items so far).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 highly values item 1 compared to others).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1 (to balance item count and valuation).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8, ensuring all items are assigned.
