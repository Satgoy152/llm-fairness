Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  73  17  86  79  39  40  55
1  60  36  89  62  46   5  34  74
2  26  98  29  17  39   6  68  95
3  22  55  45  82  17  48  92  13
4  45  20  38  32  71  87  14  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider a method that ensures each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their individual valuations while ensuring all items are distributed. One common approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm that allocates items based on the highest valuation for each item.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items following this strategy:

- Item 0: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (60).
- Item 1: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (98).
- Item 2: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (89).
- Item 3: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (86).
- Item 4: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (79).
- Item 5: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (87).
- Item 6: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (92).
- Item 7: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (95).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while each agent receives at least one item or none, and all 8 items are allocated.
