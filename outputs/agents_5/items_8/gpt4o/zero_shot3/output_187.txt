Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  73  31  98  60  43  12  18
1  21  38  17  99  57  21  88  36
2  51  30   8  75  94  54  19  91
3  80  79  62  92  62  69  26  61
4  50  94   5  90  43   4  46  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize total satisfaction by considering each agent's valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the highest at 98.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the highest at 99.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest at 94.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the highest at 80.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 the highest at 94.

Now, we look to allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations to ensure fairness.

1. **Agent 0**: Already has item 3 (98). Next highest is item 1 (73) and item 0 (35).
2. **Agent 1**: Already has item 3 (99). Next highest is item 6 (88).
3. **Agent 2**: Already has item 4 (94). Next highest is item 7 (91).
4. **Agent 3**: Already has item 0 (80). Next highest is item 3 (92), but it's already taken. Next is item 1 (79).
5. **Agent 4**: Already has item 1 (94). Next highest is item 7 (89), but it's already taken. Next is item 3 (90), but it's already taken.

Reallocating based on these observations, we arrive at the following allocation:

- Agent 0: item 3
- Agent 1: item 6
- Agent 2: item 4
- Agent 3: items 0 and 5
- Agent 4: items 1, 2, and 7

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [1, 2, 7]
}
```
