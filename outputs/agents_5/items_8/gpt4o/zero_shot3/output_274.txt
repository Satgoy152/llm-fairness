Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  73  67  28  39  77   4  54
1  82  96  39  71  57   0   0  76
2   5  57  38  10  27  26  63  80
3  84  50  47  58   4   4  87  99
4  58  56  35  31  60  85  47  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we should aim to assign the items based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll try to balance the allocations by maximizing the total valuation each agent receives for their assigned items.

Let's assign the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (95), Item 5 (77)
   - Assign Items: 0, 5

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (96), Item 7 (76)
   - Assign Items: 1, 7

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (63)
   - Assign Items: 6

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (58), Item 7 (99)
   - Assign Item: 3 (Item 7 already assigned to Agent 1)

5. **Agent 4**:  
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (85), Item 4 (60)
   - Assign Items: 4 (Item 5 already assigned to Agent 0)

Now, we have assigned 7 items. We still need to allocate one more item. We should assign the remaining items to the agents who have received fewer items based on their next highest valuations:

- Agent 2: Item 2 (38)

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures every item is assigned, and no items are left unallocated.
