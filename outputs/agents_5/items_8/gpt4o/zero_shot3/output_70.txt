Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  64  50  30  95   1  78  78  95
1  76  89  47  31  41  87  80  43
2  44  61  59   4  28  38  53  85
3  66  54  96  43  60  22  87  43
4  13  16  45  71  25  66  78  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations and ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, we can use a simple greedy approach. We will assign items to agents based on their highest valuation first, ensuring that each item is only assigned once.

### Steps to Allocate Items:

1. **Initialize**: Start with each agent having an empty list of items.
2. **Create a Priority List**: For each item, determine the agent who values it the most.
3. **Assign Items**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.
4. **Check Allocation**: Ensure all items are allocated and that each agent has been considered.

### Allocation:

Following the steps outlined above, here's how we can allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (76)
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (89)
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (96)
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (95)
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (60)
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (78)
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (87)
- **Item 7**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (98)

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 4, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent is considered, and all items are allocated based on the highest valuation by any agent for each item.
