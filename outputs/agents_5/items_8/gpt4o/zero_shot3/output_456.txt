Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  16  24  27  50  71  46  16   2
1  13  52  22  49  62  42  85   3
2  77  50  73  98  86  67  23  81
3  13  79  76   0  96  17  99  54
4  98  16  49  94  67  26  58  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations each agent assigns to the items. A simple approach is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 3 (value 96).
2. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value 99).
3. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 50).
4. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 67).
5. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (value 81).
6. Assign item 0 to agent 4 (value 98).
7. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 52).
8. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 22).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly, while also ensuring a fair distribution among agents.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
