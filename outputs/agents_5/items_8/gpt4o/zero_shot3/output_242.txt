Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  60  33  52  19   6  94  51  48
1  94  19  66   4  25  78  50  68
2  66  61  64  26  47  41  86  95
3  45  92  63  42  34   7  54   7
4  61  69  79  31  89   8  30  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we can use a simple method that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. Calculate the maximum valuation for each item across all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

After applying this method, the allocations are as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (Value: 94)
- Item 1: Agent 3 (Value: 92)
- Item 2: Agent 4 (Value: 79)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (Value: 19)
- Item 4: Agent 4 (Value: 89)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (Value: 94)
- Item 6: Agent 2 (Value: 86)
- Item 7: Agent 2 (Value: 95)

Letâ€™s ensure that all agents receive at least one item:

1. Agent 0 has items 3 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has item 0.
3. Agent 2 has items 6 and 7.
4. Agent 3 has item 1.
5. Agent 4 has items 2 and 4.

This ensures all agents receive at least one item, and total 8 items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
