Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  66  17  62  27  35  92   0
1  88  67   2  99  24  29  85  34
2  34  76  15  59  74  12  46  81
3  36  39  30  76  21   5  69  74
4  44  58  98  29   9  59   7  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 5 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total allocation of items sums up to exactly 8. We should aim to distribute the items in a manner that considers the valuations of the agents, attempting to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations and distributing the items:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Highest valued item: Item 6 (Value = 92)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (Value = 66)
   - Allocation: Items [6, 1]

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (Value = 99)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (Value = 88)
   - Allocation: Items [3, 0]

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Highest valued item: Item 7 (Value = 81)
   - Allocation: Item [7]

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Highest valued item: Item 3 (Value = 76), but it's already allocated.
   - Next highest: Item 7 (Value = 74), but it's also allocated.
   - Next highest: Item 6 (Value = 69)
   - Allocation: Item [5]

5. **Agent 4**:  
   - Highest valued item: Item 2 (Value = 98)
   - Allocation: Item [2]

Now that we've made initial allocations, verify that all 8 items are allocated and adjust as necessary:

- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7
- Items remaining: 4 (since 8 items total must be allocated)

Let's allocate the remaining item 4:

- Agent 0 already has 2 items.
- Agent 1 already has 2 items.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2, who has the next highest valuation for it (Value = 74).

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, considering their valuations as much as possible.
