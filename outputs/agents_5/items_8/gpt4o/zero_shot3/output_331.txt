Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  80  65  33  69  34  47  16
1  96  70  68  95  17  32  57  80
2  53  40  10  70  46  30  30  53
3  48  60  83  64  39   7  96  25
4  85  31  69  46  79  78  45  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that considers each agent's preferences as reflected by their valuations of the items. The goal is to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each item is only given to one agent and each agent receives at least one item.

2. Balance the distribution by considering the remaining items and distributing them to agents who have fewer items or lower total valuation, aiming for fairness in terms of both quantity and value.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value for item 1 (80)
- Agent 1: Highest value for item 0 (96)
- Agent 2: Highest value for item 3 (70)
- Agent 3: Highest value for item 6 (96)
- Agent 4: Highest value for item 7 (84)

Now, for the remaining items (2, 4, 5):

- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (83, second-highest valuation)
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (79, second-highest valuation)
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 (78, third-highest valuation)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 2],
    "4": [7, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, considering their valuations and trying to balance the overall satisfaction.
