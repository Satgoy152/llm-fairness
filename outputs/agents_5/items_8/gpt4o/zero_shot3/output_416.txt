Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  55  43  21  99  84  26  61  26
1  65  54  52  22  88  29  82   4
2  95  86   7  96  26  56  23   0
3  39  35  69  55  55   4  65  30
4   8  91  32  36  11   6  87  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, a common approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one potential allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuations for each agent and attempt to allocate those items first.
2. Ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3 (99).
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (88).
- Agent 2 highly values item 0 (95).
- Agent 3 highly values item 2 (69).
- Agent 4 highly values item 1 (91).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 also values item 6 (61).
- Agent 1 also values item 6 (82), but since item 6 is already considered for Agent 0, let's allocate items 5 (29) and 7 (4) to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 can get item 5 (56).
- Agent 3 can get item 7 (30).
- Agent 4 can get item 2 (32).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
