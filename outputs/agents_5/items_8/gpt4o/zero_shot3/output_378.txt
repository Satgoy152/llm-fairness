Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   8  83  79  71  94  12  98  71
1  81  17   4  86   8  35  76   3
2   7  54  18  12  89  52  62  53
3  17  17  57  72  85  74  34  29
4  21  28  53  42  77  37  11  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim to distribute the items in a balanced manner. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Greedy Allocation:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item or as evenly distributed as possible.
2. **Balance Check:** Ensure that all items are allocated and each agent has a fair share.

Let's analyze the given valuations and make the allocations:

- **Item 0:** Highest value is by Agent 0 (value = 8)
- **Item 1:** Highest value is by Agent 0 (value = 83)
- **Item 2:** Highest value is by Agent 0 (value = 79)
- **Item 3:** Highest value is by Agent 1 (value = 86)
- **Item 4:** Highest value is by Agent 0 (value = 94)
- **Item 5:** Highest value is by Agent 3 (value = 74)
- **Item 6:** Highest value is by Agent 0 (value = 98)
- **Item 7:** Highest value is by Agent 0 (value = 71)

Now we need to allocate these items considering fairness:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 1, 2, 4, 6]
- Agent 1 gets item: [3]
- Agent 3 gets item: [5]
- Agent 4 gets item: [7]
- Agent 2 gets no items, but must be included in the JSON.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2, 4, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution based on the highest valuations while ensuring every item is allocated to exactly one agent.
