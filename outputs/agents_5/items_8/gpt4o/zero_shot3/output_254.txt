Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77  72  23  47  72  64  55  15
1  63   5  61  99   7  36  66  50
2  22  28  58  83  24  58  96  39
3  22  31  25  38  50  76  27  95
4  44  61  94  44  89  21  32  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations. A simple method to achieve this is to allocate items to the agent who values them the highest, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. However, since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will inevitably receive more items than others.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Review the highest valuations for each item from the table.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that particular item.
3. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and not more than 8 items are distributed in total.

Following this approach, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 has the highest valuation at 77.
- Item 1: Agent 0 has the highest valuation at 72.
- Item 2: Agent 4 has the highest valuation at 94.
- Item 3: Agent 1 has the highest valuation at 99.
- Item 4: Agent 4 has the highest valuation at 89.
- Item 5: Agent 3 has the highest valuation at 76.
- Item 6: Agent 2 has the highest valuation at 96.
- Item 7: Agent 3 has the highest valuation at 95.

Let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 6.
- Agent 3 receives items 5 and 7.
- Agent 4 receives items 2 and 4.

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while respecting the integer allocation requirement.
