Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  52  23  71  50  43  82  33  89
1   7  79  68  73  67  58  90  93
2  18  28  36  84  52  31  66  18
3  78  97  41  80  53  64  12  87
4   2   2  16  84  67  99  84  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[52 23 71 50 43 82 33 89]
 [ 7 79 68 73 67 58 90 93]
 [18 28 36 84 52 31 66 18]

 [ 2  2 16 84 67 99 84 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the distribution is as fair as possible based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 seems to value item 7 highly (value of 89).
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most (value of 90).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (value of 84).
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most (value of 97).
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the most (value of 99).

Next, we distribute the remaining items based on the remaining highest values:

1. Agent 0 also values item 5 (value of 82).
2. Agent 1 also values item 7 (value of 93).
3. Agent 2 also values item 6 (value of 66).
4. Agent 3 also values item 0 (value of 78).
5. Agent 4 also values item 4 (value of 67).

Now, let's ensure everyone has at least one item and that all 8 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [7, 5]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [1, 0]
- Agent 4: [5, 4]

Let's adjust if needed to ensure exactly 8 items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item:

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 0],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```

Each agent receives items based on high valuations, ensuring all items are allocated fairly.
