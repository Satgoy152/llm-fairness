Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  75  14  85  82  85  40  50  82
1  74  18  31  37   4  97  87  67
2  69  68  40  97  21  72  15  19
3   8   1  37  91  57  66   6   8
4  10  87  65  54   2  24  77  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Given that there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more than one item.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Given their high valuation on items 0, 2, and 3, agent 0 will receive items 0 and 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 highly, so they will receive item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 highly, so they will receive item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 4 highly, so they will receive item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has a high valuation of item 1, so they will receive item 1.
6. **Remaining Items**: Items 6 and 7 are not yet allocated. Agent 1 also has a high valuation for item 6, so they will receive item 6. Agent 0 will receive item 7, as they also have a relatively high valuation for it.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
