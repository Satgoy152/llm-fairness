Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  31  62  94  67  72   5  46
1  77  46  56  84  94  72  75  99
2   9  83  43   0   5  54  14  12
3  86  90  80  70  44  27  49  55
4  20  28   0  51  87  52  64   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's analyze the given valuations and allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 0 highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 7 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 highly.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 4 highly.

Considering these preferences and attempting to distribute the items fairly, we can allocate them as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item 0 (value 98)
- **Agent 1**: Gets items 4 and 7 (values 94 and 99)
- **Agent 2**: Gets item 1 (value 83)
- **Agent 3**: Gets items 3 and 5 (values 70 and 27)
- **Agent 4**: Gets items 2 and 6 (values 0 and 64)

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each receiving an integer number of items.
