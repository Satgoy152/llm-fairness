Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  49  66  87  41  11  29  42
1  36  72  71  27  61  52   9  45
2  42  51   1  81  39  81  84  77
3   3  75  52  40  72  74  21  73
4  72  40  26  52  30  53  99  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 5 agents, we'll consider the values each agent assigns to the items and aim for a balanced distribution of total value among the agents. We will try to ensure that each agent receives a roughly equal share of the total value, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's one potential allocation:

- Agent 0 values: 44, 49, 66, 87, 41, 11, 29, 42
- Agent 1 values: 36, 72, 71, 27, 61, 52, 9, 45
- Agent 2 values: 42, 51, 1, 81, 39, 81, 84, 77
- Agent 3 values: 3, 75, 52, 40, 72, 74, 21, 73
- Agent 4 values: 72, 40, 26, 52, 30, 53, 99, 26

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Allocate items based on maximizing the agent's total value from the items they receive, subject to each getting at least one item and the total sum being balanced as much as possible.

Allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 3]
  - Total value = 44 + 87 = 131
- Agent 1: [1, 4]
  - Total value = 72 + 61 = 133
- Agent 2: [5]
  - Total value = 81
- Agent 3: [7]
  - Total value = 73
- Agent 4: [2, 6]
  - Total value = 26 + 99 = 125

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```
