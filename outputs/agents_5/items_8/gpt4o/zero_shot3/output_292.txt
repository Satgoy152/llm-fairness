Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  58  58  65  98  45  24  58
1   6  27  28  19  12   4  93  46
2  28  51  60  81  92  75  93  74
3  82  80  49  95  88  15  32  89
4  78  47   0   7  34  57  46  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can follow a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here is how the allocation might look:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (97).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (58).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (60).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (95).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (98).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (75).
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (93).
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (89).

Now, let's summarize the allocations for each agent:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [6]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 7]
- Agent 4: No items

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": []
}
```
