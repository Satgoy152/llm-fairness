Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  35  83  48   9  76  68  20   6
1  52  44  59   4  19   6  86  12
2  55  21  85  41  74  33  11  22
3  13  10  77  21  19  97  75  28
4  75  42  30  36  78  44  89  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent is content with their allocation. One common approach is to maximize the total valuation across all agents, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible, given the constraint of integer allocations and the number of items).

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Look at each agent's highest-valued items and try to assign them those items first.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. Balance the remaining items among the agents to maximize overall satisfaction.

Based on the valuations given:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
- Agent 1 values items 2 and 6 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most, followed by item 4.
- Agent 3 values item 5 significantly more than the others.
- Agent 4 values item 7 the highest.

Let's allocate items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Items 0, 3, and 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 3, 7]
}
```
