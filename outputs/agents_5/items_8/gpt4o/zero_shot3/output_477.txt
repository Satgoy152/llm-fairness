Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  20  21  57  67  71  48  61
1  48  53  75  38  53  72  75  95
2  49  89  65  17  61  20  14  15
3  60  41   8  35  48  82  40   0
4  21  58   1  59  54  76  87  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent is satisfied relative to the value they place on the items they receive. 

Here's one possible approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 0 with a value of 81.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 7 with a value of 95.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 1 with a value of 89.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 5 with a value of 82.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valued item is item 6 with a value of 87.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.

Next, allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 4):

- **Agent 1**: 
  - Next highest valued available item is item 2 (value 75).
  - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 4**: 
  - Next highest valued available item is item 3 (value 59).
  - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

- **Agent 0**: 
  - Next highest valued available item is item 4 (value 67).
  - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

After these allocations, each agent has received items based on their highest valuations and 8 items have been allocated in total.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [6, 3]
}
```
