Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  33  80  15  33  33  34  13
1  24  92  12   1   5  66   2   1
2  67  76  82  95  56  75  19  74
3  91  19  69  48  53  29  70   1
4  52   9  54  13  99  31   6  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [67 76 82 95 56 75 19 74]
 [91 19 69 48 53 29 70  1]
 [52  9 54 13 99 31  6 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible, and the total number of items distributed is exactly 8.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [98, 33, 80, 15, 33, 33, 34, 13]
Agent 1: [24, 92, 12, 1, 5, 66, 2, 1]
Agent 2: [67, 76, 82, 95, 56, 75, 19, 74]
Agent 3: [91, 19, 69, 48, 53, 29, 70, 1]
Agent 4: [52, 9, 54, 13, 99, 31, 6, 69]
```

Let's allocate the items as follows:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 0 (98). We'll allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 1 (92). We'll allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 3 (95). We'll allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 6 (70). We'll allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 4 (99). We'll allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 2, 5, and 7.

6. **Agent 0** can take item 2 (80), as they have the highest valuation after item 0.
7. **Agent 2** can take item 5 (75), as they have the highest valuation after item 3.
8. **Agent 4** can take item 7 (69), as they have the highest valuation after item 4.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
