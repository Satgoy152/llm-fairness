Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  74  36  77  34  59  19  54
1  99  50  95   4  60  75  32  60
2  87   7  67  47  41  30  34  60
3  76   9  96  38  87  44  94  37
4  55  31   9  65  76  23  14  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy where each agent gets items based on their preferences while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. A possible approach is to prioritize the highest valuations first and ensure that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by identifying the highest valuations for each item.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

Let's perform the allocation based on the provided data:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value: 99).
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value: 74).
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (value: 96).
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value: 77).
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (value: 87).
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value: 75).
- Item 6: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (value: 94).
- Item 7: Highest valuation is by agent 4 (value: 70).

Now, let's ensure that all items are fairly allocated, and each agent gets an integer number of items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Items 0, 5
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 2, 4, 6
- Agent 4: Item 7

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 4, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents with consideration for their valuations.
