Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  97  28  90  84  20   2  33
1  53  31  54  56  68  96  55  40
2  10  93  57  78  36  89  30  75
3   4   6  78  49  45  96  37  97
4  50  18  72  93  14  84  26  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 8 items are distributed. A possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we iteratively assign the highest-valued unallocated item to the agent who values it most. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (97).
2. **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (93).
3. **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (96).
4. **Item 7**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (97).
5. **Item 2**: Highest valuation among remaining agents is by Agent 3 (78).
6. **Item 0**: Highest valuation among remaining agents is by Agent 0 (54), but since Agent 0 already has one item, let's allocate it to Agent 4 who values it next highest (50).
7. **Item 6**: Highest valuation among remaining agents is by Agent 1 (55).
8. **Item 4**: Highest valuation among remaining agents is by Agent 1 (68).

Now, let's assign the items based on these valuations:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [5, 6, 4]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [7, 2]
- Agent 4: [3, 0]

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5, 6, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [7, 2],
    "4": [3, 0]
}
```
