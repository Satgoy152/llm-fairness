Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  89  38  19  77  42  81  85
1  37  98  14   1  67  51  82  35
2  81  13   6   7   8  40  55  75
3  29  26  85   6   7  90   0  86
4   2  65  31  76  21  18  46  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for a balanced distribution based on their valuations. We'll try to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value relatively highly compared to other agents.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, and 7.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 3 highly values items 2 and 5.
- Agent 4 values item 3 highly.

Considering these preferences and aiming for a fair distribution, the allocation could be as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Items 0, 7
- Agent 3: Items 2, 5
- Agent 4: Item 3

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
