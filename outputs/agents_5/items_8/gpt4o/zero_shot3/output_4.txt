Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  85  71  60  12  48  67  81  91
1  91  75  22   0  49  77  69   3
2  49  28  45  92  68  83  23  85
3  25  39  29  53  60  31  77  44
4   5  27  30  87  98  63  93  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent receives at least one item, and the remaining items are distributed based on the highest valuations. We need to ensure that all 8 items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. First, allocate one item to each agent based on their highest individual valuation to ensure everyone gets at least one item.
2. Allocate the remaining items to maximize total valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

- Agent 0: Highest valuation is for item 7 (91)
- Agent 1: Highest valuation is for item 0 (91)
- Agent 2: Highest valuation is for item 3 (92)
- Agent 3: Highest valuation is for item 6 (77)
- Agent 4: Highest valuation is for item 4 (98)

Now, 3 items are left to allocate: items 1, 2, and 5.

For the remaining items, allocate to the agents with the next highest valuations:

- Item 5 goes to Agent 2 (83)
- Item 1 goes to Agent 0 (71)
- Item 2 goes to Agent 4 (30)

This ensures that all items are allocated fairly.

The final allocation in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```
