Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   5  42  28   6  68  39  73  47
1  12  85  49  10  94  49  85  41
2  73  40   7  52  54  36  47  78
3  53  69  44  57  11  78  86  21
4   3   6  63  70  34  20  73  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute items such that each agent receives a few items, and the overall value each agent receives is balanced as much as possible. Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will have to receive more items than others. 

One approach is to assign items based on the highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We can also try to ensure that no agent receives a disproportionately high total valuation compared to others.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Assign one item to each agent based on the highest valuation that isn't already assigned.
2. Assign the remaining items to balance the total value as much as possible among the agents.

Let's look at the allocation based on the table:

- Agent 0: Highest value is for item 6 (value 73)
- Agent 1: Highest value is for item 4 (value 94)
- Agent 2: Highest value is for item 0 (value 73)
- Agent 3: Highest value is for item 6 (value 86, but already assigned to agent 0), next highest is item 5 (value 78)
- Agent 4: Highest value is for item 2 (value 63)

After this initial assignment:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [2]

Now, 3 items are left to be assigned: 1, 3, and 7. Let's distribute these while trying to maintain fairness in total value:

- Agent 0: Next highest value is item 1 (value 42)
- Agent 1: Next highest value is item 7 (value 41)
- Agent 2: Next highest value is item 3 (value 52)

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [6, 1]
- Agent 1: [4, 7]
- Agent 2: [0, 3]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [2]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```
