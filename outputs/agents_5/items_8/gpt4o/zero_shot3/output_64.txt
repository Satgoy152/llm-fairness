Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  83   9  79  85  51  92  49
1  61  50  94  57  80   2  32  85
2   1  36  78  38  81  10  78  85
3  49  72  34  61  13  34  48  81
4  39   0  66  50  36  55  92  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table and determine a reasonable distribution:

1. **Agent 0** has high values on items 0, 1, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 4.
4. **Agent 3** could benefit from item 7.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 highly, but since agent 0 also values it highly, we can look for an alternative item.

With these observations, we can make an initial allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 1.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 4.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 7.
- **Agent 4**: Assign items 3, 5, and 6.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, and agents receive items based on their valuations.

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 5, 6]
}
```
