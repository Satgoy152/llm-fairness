Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  29  35  93  40  60  24  99  90
1   6   7  84  56  93  20  84  63
2  52  77  95  29  39  10  89  80
3  42  84  66  62  20  51  43  48
4  41   3  63  88  78   4  88  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and all items are distributed.

We can approach this problem by iteratively assigning the highest-valued unallocated item to the agent who values it the most until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 99, the highest of all agents.
2. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 93, the highest of all agents.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it at 95, the highest of all agents.
4. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it at 84, the highest of all agents.
5. **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it at 88, the highest of all agents.
6. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 90, the highest of the remaining unallocated items.
7. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it at 52, the highest of the remaining unallocated items.
8. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it at 51, the highest of the remaining unallocated items.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
