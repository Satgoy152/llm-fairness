Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  73  32  52   2  64  67  67  25
1  12  35  46  20  76  13  54  33
2  52  59  62  46  74  54  82  97
3  87  77  42  47  15  21  66  66
4  21  10  76  99  23  54  69  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple method based on maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are distributed. Let's try to distribute the items to maximize fairness:

1. First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:
   - Agent 0: 73 + 32 + 52 + 2 + 64 + 67 + 67 + 25 = 382
   - Agent 1: 12 + 35 + 46 + 20 + 76 + 13 + 54 + 33 = 289
   - Agent 2: 52 + 59 + 62 + 46 + 74 + 54 + 82 + 97 = 526
   - Agent 3: 87 + 77 + 42 + 47 + 15 + 21 + 66 + 66 = 421
   - Agent 4: 21 + 10 + 76 + 99 + 23 + 54 + 69 + 79 = 431

2. To fairly allocate, aim to give agents items where they have relatively higher valuations compared to others.

Allocating items:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (highest valuation for item 3 is 99).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (highest valuation for item 0 is 87).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (highest valuation for item 7 is 97).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation for item 6 is 82).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (highest valuation for item 4 is 76).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (next highest valuation for item 2 is 76).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (highest valuation for item 5 is 67).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation for item 1 is 77).

This allocation respects each agent's preferences and ensures that all items are distributed. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```
