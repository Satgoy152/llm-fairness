Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  18  69  34  64  73  20  56
1  16   7  15   5  60  47  44  31
2  76  57  52  89  39  45  41  98
3  37  30  77  38  25  72  67  54
4  13  35  39  76  75  21  79  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a simple approach where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that every agent is satisfied with their allocation as they receive the items they value the most.

Here is the allocation based on the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 76.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 57.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 69.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 89.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 64.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with a value of 73.
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 79.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 98.

Based on this allocation strategy, here is how the items are distributed among the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents according to their highest valuations.
