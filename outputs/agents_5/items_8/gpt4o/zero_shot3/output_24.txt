Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  97  79  87   7  84  55  77  44
1  25  99   1   7   6  96  72  79
2  38  60  54   6  36  82  57   8
3  67  43  23  53  51  59  96  84
4  38  67  87  90  57  62  92  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their individual valuations. Here is one possible allocation strategy, where each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items is exactly 8:

1. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 values item 0 the highest (97), we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (99), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (82), so we allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 6 the highest (96), so we allocate item 6 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (90), so we allocate item 3 to agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (2, 4, and 7) to ensure fairness and maximize individual agent satisfaction:

6. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 to agent 0, as they value it second highest after item 0.
7. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 to agent 1, as it is the next highest available value for them after item 1.
8. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 7 to agent 4, as it provides a good value after item 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all 8 items are distributed among the agents.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```
