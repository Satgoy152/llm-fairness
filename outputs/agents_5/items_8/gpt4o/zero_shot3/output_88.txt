Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  41  28  71  98  98  99  53
1  90  97  69   1  22  39  80  47
2  69  16  73  60  56  81  56  38
3  37   9  24  18  52  37  12   6
4  98  98  48   4  62   1  34  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and only 8 items are allocated in total. 

Here is a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. List all items and find out which agent values each item the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 8 items are distributed.

Let's determine the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (98).
- Item 1: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (98).
- Item 2: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (73).
- Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (71).
- Item 4: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (98).
- Item 5: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (98).
- Item 6: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (99).
- Item 7: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (95).

Now, let's ensure that the allocation is balanced:

- Agent 0: 4 items (3, 4, 5, 6)
- Agent 1: 0 items
- Agent 2: 1 item (2)
- Agent 3: 0 items
- Agent 4: 3 items (0, 1, 7)

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 5, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 1, 7]
}
```
