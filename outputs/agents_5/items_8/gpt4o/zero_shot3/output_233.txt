Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  36  65  23  47  92  74  12  18
1  70  93  36   5  29  98  49  62
2  66  19   2  47  71  92  55  22
3  69  35  50   2  64  87  22  20
4  21  14  99  37  61  18  22  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives a number of items in such a way that the total valuation across all items is balanced. The goal is to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one approach to allocate the items fairly among the agents:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: Sum the valuations for each agent across all items.
2. **Allocate Items to Maximize Satisfaction**: Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations until all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with allocating the items:

### Initial Step: Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent
Agent 0: 36 + 65 + 23 + 47 + 92 + 74 + 12 + 18 = 367  
Agent 1: 70 + 93 + 36 + 5 + 29 + 98 + 49 + 62 = 442  
Agent 2: 66 + 19 + 2 + 47 + 71 + 92 + 55 + 22 = 374  
Agent 3: 69 + 35 + 50 + 2 + 64 + 87 + 22 + 20 = 349  
Agent 4: 21 + 14 + 99 + 37 + 61 + 18 + 22 + 87 = 359  

### Allocation Strategy:
Let's allocate items based on higher valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (92), 5 (74), 1 (65)
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (93), 5 (98), 0 (70)
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (92), 4 (71), 6 (55)
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (87), 0 (69), 2 (50)
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (99), 7 (87), 4 (61)

### Final Allocation:
After considering the above, here is a possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [4]
- **Agent 1**: [1, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [6]
- **Agent 3**: [0]
- **Agent 4**: [2, 3, 7]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed based on the highest preference of each agent while maintaining fairness.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent items based on their preferences and ensures all items are allocated.
