Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  83  70  28  54  30  81  28
1  70  59  51  79  80  13  41  54
2  93  95  94  71  41   8  99  72
3  14  46  87  19  50  27  27  89
4  16   4  93  27  30   1  58  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations provided and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents based on maximizing their individual values while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
2. Try to ensure the sum of the values for each agent is balanced as much as possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has high value for item 1.
- Agent 1 has high value for item 4.
- Agent 2 has high value for item 6.
- Agent 3 has high value for item 7.
- Agent 4 has high value for item 2.
- Redistribute remaining items in a balanced way.

Based on this strategy, here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2, 3, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a fair share of items based on their preferences, and all 8 items are allocated.
