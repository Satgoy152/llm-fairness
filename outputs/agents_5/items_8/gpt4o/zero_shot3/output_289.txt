Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  28   9  69  49  43  54  23  10
1  43  90  90  62  48  14  11  72
2  55  59  62  51  28  15  96  14
3  35  15  44  44   9  22  20  81
4  31  18  87  80  89  75  91  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Our aim is to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. We will try to give each agent the items they value the most, balancing the total number of items each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values are relatively balanced, but lower than others on high-value items.
   - Allocate item 0 (value 28).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values for items 1, 2, and 7.
   - Allocate items 1 and 2 (values 90, 90).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value for item 6.
   - Allocate item 6 (value 96).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value for item 7.
   - Allocate item 7 (value 81).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - High values for items 3, 4, and 5.
   - Allocate items 3, 4, and 5 (values 80, 89, 75).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their preferences, and all 8 items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 4, 5]
}
```
