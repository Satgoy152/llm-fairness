Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  96  99  77  81   4  77  36
1  56  90  65  88  68  94  27  32
2  13   4  75  99  94  48  32  60
3  21  44  58  26  70  71  30  15
4  68  17  77  53  84   8  51  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [56 90 65 88 68 94 27 32]
 [13  4 75 99 94 48 32 60]
 [21 44 58 26 70 71 30 15]
 [68 17 77 53 84  8 51 42]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Given the valuation table, we can use a greedy approach to allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 2 (Value: 99)
   - Item 1 (Value: 96)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 5 (Value: 94)
   - Item 3 (Value: 88)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 (Value: 94)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 6 (Value: 30)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 0 (Value: 68)
   - Item 7 (Value: 42)

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items based on their highest valuations.

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```
