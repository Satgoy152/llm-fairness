Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  58  13  10  13  29  76  84
1  17  31  13  10  78  61  98  92
2  46  59  50  67  78  56  59  48
3  82  42  54   4  82  96   4  63
4  52  27  68  11  69  91  13  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items. A common approach is to look at the valuations and try to assign items such that the total value for each agent is as equitable as possible.

Let's analyze the table to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (84), Item 6 (76)
   
2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (98), Item 7 (92)
   
3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (78), Item 3 (67)
   
4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (82), Item 5 (96)
   
5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (91), Item 2 (68)

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 7
- **Agent 1**: Assign Item 6
- **Agent 2**: Assign Item 4
- **Agent 3**: Assign Item 5
- **Agent 4**: Assign Items 0 and 2

Now we have allocated 6 items, and we need to allocate 2 more:

- **Agent 0**: Assign Item 1
- **Agent 3**: Assign Item 3

This allocation aims to balance the total values received by each agent as much as possible, given the constraints.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
