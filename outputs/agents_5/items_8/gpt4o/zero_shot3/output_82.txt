Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  68  30  44  17  71  20  83  42
1  60  59   4   4  32   5  40  95
2  29   0  79  89   6  44  78  35
3  37  91  96  13  90  35  40   0
4  30  58   2   6  42  11  89  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach is to allocate items in a way that attempts to maximize the minimum satisfaction among all agents, thereby ensuring a fair distribution.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 (68), 4 (71), and 6 (83). Assign item 6 to agent 0, as that is their highest value.
2. **Agent 1** values item 7 (95) the most. Assign item 7 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 (89) the most. Assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 (96) the most. Assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 6 (89) the most, but since item 6 is already allocated, the next highest is item 3 (42). However, item 3 is also taken, so assign item 1 (58) to agent 4.

With these allocations, we have already distributed 5 items. Now we need to allocate the remaining 3 items (0, 4, and 5):

6. Item 0 is valued highly by agent 0 (68), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
7. Item 4 can be given to agent 3, who values it at 90, which is very high.
8. Finally, item 5 can be assigned to agent 2, who values it at 44.

With these allocations, each agent has received an item, and all 8 items have been allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
