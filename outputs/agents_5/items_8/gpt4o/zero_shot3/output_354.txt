Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  48  10  29  79  17  94  64
1  25  67  39  94  44  13  48  25
2  92  96  16  33  17   5   2  64
3  73   3  56  73  64  61  99  31
4  35  33  68  12  16  80   8  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [35 33 68 12 16 80  8 79]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations accordingly.

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are [69, 48, 10, 29, 79, 17, 94, 64]. The highest value is 94 for item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are [25, 67, 39, 94, 44, 13, 48, 25]. The highest value is 94 for item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are [92, 96, 16, 33, 17, 5, 2, 64]. The highest value is 96 for item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are [73, 3, 56, 73, 64, 61, 99, 31]. The highest value is 99 for item 6, but item 6 is already taken. The next highest is 73 for items 0 and 3. We can give item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are [35, 33, 68, 12, 16, 80, 8, 79]. The highest value is 80 for item 5.

Now, let's assign the items:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

We have assigned 5 items. Now let's assign the remaining 3 items by considering the next highest values for each agent without overlapping:

- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest value is 79).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (next highest value is 79).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (next highest value is 39).

Now, all 8 items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```
