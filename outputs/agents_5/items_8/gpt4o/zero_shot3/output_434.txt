Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  86  68  82  65  10  96  98
1   6  69  73  62  53  96  58  15
2  84   0  40  13  85  75  38  32
3  31   5   9  61  96   9  81  12
4  63  82  27  37  10  20  65  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic approach. We will try to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets a fair number of items. Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (84).
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (86).
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most (73).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (82).
5. Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (96).
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most (96).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (96).
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most (98).

Now, let's ensure a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 has too many items (1, 3, 6, 7). We will reallocate some of these to balance the distribution.
- Reassign item 6 to Agent 3 who values it second highest (81).
- Reassign item 7 to Agent 4 who values it second highest (21).

Revised allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 3]
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [4, 6]
- Agent 4: [7]

Now, let's present the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
