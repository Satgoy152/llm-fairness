Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   9  66  57  91  45  48  57  53
1  72  86  71  46  89  99   2  36
2  24  12   6  97  92  55  85  15
3  66  38  70   4  32  22  27  66
4  38  42  66   6  51  25  83  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no more than two items, given there are 8 items and 5 agents.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate accordingly:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (91) and item 1 second most (66).
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most (99) and item 4 second most (89).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most (97) and item 4 second most (92).
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the most (66) and item 2 second most (70).
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the most (96) and item 6 second most (83).

To ensure fairness and maximize total satisfaction:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2, as they value it the most at 97.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1, as they value it the most at 99.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 2, as they have the second highest valuation for it at 92.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3, as they value it the most at 66.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 3, as they value it second most at 70.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 4, as they value it the most at 96.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation of 66 and are left without an item.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 4, as they have the second highest valuation for it at 83.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [7, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuation.
