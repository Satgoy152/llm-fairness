Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81   9  44  94  18  43  94  75
1  28  39  35  82  36  66  38  43
2  82  38  18  72  87  27   2  74
3  18  14  83  85  24   2  37  58
4  82  36  26  67  28  98  90  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [82 36 26 67 28 98 90 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. A common approach is to use a method like the "greedy" algorithm, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and each item is allocated only once. Below is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 and 3 highly. Let's allocate those to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 highly. Let's allocate it to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 and 7 highly. Let's allocate those to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 and 6 highly. Let's allocate those to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 can have item 1, which is still available.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items have been allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
