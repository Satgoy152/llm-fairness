Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  64  22  51  23  83  62  67
1  84  53  17  69  94  62  77  45
2  55  47  95  86  96  10  40  61
3  15  43  17   9  89   3  26  71
4   3  81  64  22  32  81  44  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated. A common approach is to maximize the overall valuation by assigning items to the agents who value them most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Here's a step-by-step process for allocating the items:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Item Across All Agents:**
   - This helps to understand which items are generally more valued across all agents.

2. **Assign Items to Agents:**
   - Start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most.
   - Make sure each agent gets at least one item.
   - Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure fairness.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 most highly (83).
- Agent 1 values item 4 most highly (94).
- Agent 2 values item 4 next most highly, but since it's already allocated to Agent 1, allocate item 2 (95).
- Agent 3 values item 7 most highly (71).
- Agent 4 values item 1 most highly (81).

Now each agent has at least one item, and we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1 (84).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 2 (86).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 0 (62).

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This distribution ensures each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.
