Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  63   5  13   0  92  77  85
1  93  42  13  40  58  74  17  88
2  66  54  51  60  24  61   2  89
3  23   0  45  93  48  25  89  56
4  21  29  81  89  50  61   4  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item (since there are 8 items and 5 agents, one agent can have two items). A simple approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation each agent has for a particular item, ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent and each agent gets at least one item.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 (63) and 5 (92).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0 (93).
3. Agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 2 (51).
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the most (93).
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (50).

After assigning these items, we need to allocate the remaining items considering the best valuations left and ensuring every agent gets at least one item:

- Item 6: Agent 3 has a high valuation (89).
- Item 7: Agent 1 has a high valuation (88).

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are assigned.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that the total number of items is 8, each agent has at least one item, and the distribution is based on the highest valuation each agent has for the unallocated items.
