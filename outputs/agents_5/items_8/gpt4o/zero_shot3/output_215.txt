Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  82  14  60  76  86  32  53  78
1   9  18  57  75  33  79  36  97
2  68  25  70  16   6  98  74  67
3  36   3  18   7  63  53  73  53
4  34  39  85  54  53  72  20  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Given that there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Below is a possible allocation strategy:

- Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations to maximize the total benefit.

Here's how we can do it:

1. **Agent 0**: With high values for items 0, 4, and 7, assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 1, but it's already assigned. Assign items 5 and 6, which are still valuable.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 5 to Agent 2, but as it's already assigned, assign 2 and 3 due to high values.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign items 6 to Agent 3, but as it's already assigned, assign item 4 and 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign items 2 and 3. However, as they're already assigned, assign item 1.

After adjusting for already assigned items, a fair allocation would be:

- Agent 0: [0, 4]
- Agent 1: [5, 7]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [1]

Now, let's present the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
