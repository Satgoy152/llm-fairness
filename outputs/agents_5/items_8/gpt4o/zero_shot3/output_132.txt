Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  31   3  28  92  42  89  33
1  54  70  11  88   8  65  73  43
2   3  70  38  27  96  32  71  77
3  46  50  43   6  11  39   8  24
4  73  77  42  74  24  15  92  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all 8 items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the highest at 92. Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
   - Next, Agent 0 values item 6 at 89. Allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 88. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Next, Agent 1 values item 1 at 70. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 96, but it has already been allocated to Agent 0. Next, Agent 2 values item 7 at 77. Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 50, but it has already been allocated to Agent 1. Next, Agent 3 values item 0 at 46. Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 values item 1 the highest at 77, but it has already been allocated to Agent 1. Next, Agent 4 values item 0 at 73, but it has already been allocated to Agent 3. Then, Agent 4 values item 6 at 92, but it has already been allocated to Agent 0. Next, Agent 4 values item 3 at 74, but it has already been allocated to Agent 1. Allocate item 5 to Agent 4, as it values it at 15 and all higher valued items have been allocated.

6. **Remaining Items**:
   - The only remaining item is item 2, which has not been allocated. Agent 4 has valued it at 42, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

After this allocation, all items have been distributed.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```
