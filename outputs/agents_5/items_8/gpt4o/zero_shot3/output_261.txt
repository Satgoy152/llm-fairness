Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  33  32  20  42  51  98  63  68
1  82  61  46  76  56  80   7  25
2  55   1  91  41  65  25  38  36
3  29  49  29  19  53  81  17  31
4  33  32  23   2  87  70  21  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to ensure each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. Additionally, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and exactly 8 items in total are allocated. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 seems to value item 5 the highest (98). We'll allocate item 5 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (82). We'll allocate item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (91). We'll allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 highly (81), but since it's already taken, we'll allocate item 4 to agent 3, as it is their next highest valued item (53).
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (87), but since it's already taken, we'll allocate item 6 to agent 4, as it is their next highest valued item (70).

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 3 more items to agents. Let's distribute the remaining items in a way that tries to balance the total valuation for each agent:

6. Allocate item 3 to agent 1, as they value it at 76.
7. Allocate item 1 to agent 0, as they value it at 32.
8. Allocate item 7 to agent 4, as they value it at 15.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.
