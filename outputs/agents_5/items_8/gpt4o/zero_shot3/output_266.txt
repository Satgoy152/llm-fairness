Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  36  15  36  48  85  23  66
1  86   6  13  49  70  39  32  91
2   5  37  14  12  58  77  73  58
3   9  24   0  97  59  65  61  87
4  48  44  37  95  22  41  23  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, considering their individual valuations for each item. Since there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Letâ€™s attempt to allocate the items as evenly as possible while maximizing individual satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 5 (85), 4 (48)
   - Allocation: [5, 4]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 7 (91), 0 (86)
   - Allocation: [7, 0]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (73), 5 (77)
   - Allocation: [6]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (97), 7 (87)
   - Allocation: [3]

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valued items: 3 (95), 7 (88)
   - Allocation: [1, 2]

Revising to ensure all items are allocated and each agent is considered:

- **Agent 0** gets items: [4]
- **Agent 1** gets items: [7]
- **Agent 2** gets items: [5]
- **Agent 3** gets items: [3, 0]
- **Agent 4** gets items: [1, 2, 6]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
