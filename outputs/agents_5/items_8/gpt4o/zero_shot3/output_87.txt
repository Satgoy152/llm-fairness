Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  95  26  36  10  29  71   6  67
1  79  32  41   6  42  25  12  72
2   1  86  47  71   0  53  93  73
3  11  96  70  18  74  69  44   6
4  37  99  67  35  37   5  10  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to distribute the items in a way that reflects their valuations. A simple way to do this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This greedy approach ensures that each item goes to the agent who appreciates it the most, maximizing the overall satisfaction.

Let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 95, which is the highest.
2. Item 1: Agent 4 values it at 99, which is the highest.
3. Item 2: Agent 3 values it at 70, which is the highest.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 71, which is the highest.
5. Item 4: Agent 3 values it at 74, which is the highest.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 71, which is the highest.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 93, which is the highest.
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 72, which is the highest.

Now, let's compile these allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items have been allocated, with each item going to the agent who values it the most.
