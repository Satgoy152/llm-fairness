Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   7  32  48  34  41  65  81  87
1  65  27  77  44  21  65   4  74
2  59  69  84  11  93  97  47  93
3  66   2  49  29  18  57  39  67
4  35  38   2  32  33  72  55   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a distribution where each agent receives at least one item, and their preferences are considered as much as possible. Since there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more than one item. Let's work through the process:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   Agent 0 values item 7 the most (87). Assign item 7 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:  
   Agent 1 values item 2 the most (77). Assign item 2 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:  
   Agent 2 values item 5 the most (97). Assign item 5 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:  
   Agent 3 values item 0 the most (66). Assign item 0 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:  
   Agent 4 values item 5 the most, but it's already taken. Their next highest preference is item 5, but it's also taken. Assign item 1 to agent 4, their next highest preference (38).

6. **Distribute Remaining Items**:  
   The unallocated items are 3, 4, and 6. We'll assign these to the agents based on their next highest preferences.

   - **Agent 0**: Already has item 7, their next highest preference among remaining items is item 6 (81). Assign item 6 to agent 0.
   - **Agent 1**: Already has item 2, their next highest preference among remaining items is item 4 (21). Assign item 4 to agent 1.
   - **Agent 2**: Already has item 5, their next highest preference among remaining items is item 3 (11). Assign item 3 to agent 2.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```
