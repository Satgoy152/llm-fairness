Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  61   7  83  96  26  54  95  93
1  57  38  79  21  93  46  70  49
2  30  32  70  11  81  18  61   4
3  18  84  11  78  82  60  21  22
4  20  95  47  69   0   8  59  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that every agent gets an integer number of items, and the total value each agent derives from their allocated items is relatively balanced. Here is an allocation plan based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for several items. We can allocate items that are highly valued by Agent 0 but not as highly valued by other agents.
2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, we can allocate items that Agent 1 values considerably more than the others.
3. **Agent 2**: We should find items that are relatively more valuable to Agent 2 than to others.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that are valued by Agent 3 more than others.
5. **Agent 4**: Finally, assign items that are more valuable to Agent 4 than to the other agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 96, highest for this item).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 93, highest for this item).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (value 30, which is the highest comparative value Agent 2 has for any item).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 84, highest for this item).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (value 47, reasonably high compared to the others).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (value 60, highest for this item).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value 95, highest for this item).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (value 72, highest for this item).

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8.
