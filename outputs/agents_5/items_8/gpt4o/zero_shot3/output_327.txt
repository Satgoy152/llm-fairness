Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  36  11  56  44  61  87  94
1  57  68  93  48   8  52  59  27
2  43  74  95  16  32  29  34  77
3  49  11  74  42  50  16   5   7
4  98  60  83  11  63  37  43  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items such that the total value of items they receive is as equitable as possible. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation by considering the values each agent places on the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocating items that agent 0 values highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocating items that agent 1 values highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Allocating items that agent 2 values highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocating items that agent 3 values highly.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocating items that agent 4 values highly.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are 94 (Item 7) and 87 (Item 6).
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are 93 (Item 2) and 68 (Item 1).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are 95 (Item 2) and 77 (Item 7).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are 74 (Item 2) and 50 (Item 4).
- **Agent 4**: Highest values are 98 (Item 0) and 83 (Item 2).

Considering these, a possible fair allocation (attempting to balance the total value each agent receives) is:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 7
2. **Agent 1**: Item 1
3. **Agent 2**: Item 6
4. **Agent 3**: Item 4, Item 3
5. **Agent 4**: Item 0, Item 2, Item 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable share of high-value items.

Here's the final JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [0, 2, 5]
}
```
