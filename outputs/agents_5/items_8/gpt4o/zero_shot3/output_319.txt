Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  35  76  50  11  65  11   6
1  76  77  97  99  34  54  77  62
2  86  81  90  33  31  28  31  43
3  60  59  66  81  43  37  23  35
4  66  33  49  66  71  25  40  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to distribute the items so that each agent receives a share that reflects their preferences, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Given the valuations, a common approach is to attempt to maximize the total value that each agent receives from their allocated items. We can use a heuristic approach to assign items to agents by iterating through the items and assigning each to the agent who values it most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (highest value for item 0 is 86).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (highest value for item 1 is 77).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (highest value for item 2 is 97).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (highest value for item 3 is 99).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (highest value for item 4 is 71).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (highest value for item 5 is 65).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 1 (highest value for item 6 is 77).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (highest value for item 7 is 43).

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 2, 3, and 6.
- Agent 2 gets items 0 and 7.
- Agent 3 gets no items.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences.
