Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  36  71  25  23  11  32  61
1  80  83  72   6   0  46   9  94
2  46  91  53  41  60   7  63  29
3  15  81  48  47  77  40  40  93
4  72  32  80  80  60  74  72  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations for each agent:

```
Agent 0: [46, 36, 71, 25, 23, 11, 32, 61]
Agent 1: [80, 83, 72, 6, 0, 46, 9, 94]
Agent 2: [46, 91, 53, 41, 60, 7, 63, 29]
Agent 3: [15, 81, 48, 47, 77, 40, 40, 93]
Agent 4: [72, 32, 80, 80, 60, 74, 72, 67]
```

To allocate fairly, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. One simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (80).
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (91).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (71).
4. Item 3: Agents 3 and 4 both value it the most (80), choose one, let's go with Agent 4.
5. Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (77).
6. Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most (74).
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most (63).
8. Item 7: Agent 1 values it the most (94).

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 7]
- Agent 2: [1, 6]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [3, 5]

Converting this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

This ensures that all 8 items are allocated, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their valuations.
