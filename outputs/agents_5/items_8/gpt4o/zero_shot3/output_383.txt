Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  63  83  51  23  79  87  84  92
1   6  18  21  39  24  78  33  59
2  52  92  98  44  63  71  41  74
3  48  99  79  47  19  83  77   0
4  56  43  54  80   6  65  87  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given that there are 8 items and 5 agents, one possible way to achieve a fair allocation is to distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is relatively balanced.

Let's start by examining the valuations and making initial allocations based on maximum values and balancing the total values:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5, 6, and 7. 
2. Agent 1 has higher value for item 5 and 7.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 highly.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 highly.

Now, let's try to allocate the items in a fair manner:

- Agent 0: Items 0 and 6 (63 + 84 = 147)
- Agent 1: Items 3 and 5 (39 + 78 = 117)
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 4 (98 + 63 = 161)
- Agent 3: Item 1 (99)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (88)

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7]
}
```
