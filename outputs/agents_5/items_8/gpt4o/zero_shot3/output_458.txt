Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  26  38  21  23  85  73  66
1  41  25   6  79   6  73  98  49
2  69  99  14  92  64  83  91  18
3  75  43   1  37  47  80  98   6
4  83  69  84  16  22  19  56  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed. This problem can be approached using a strategy that attempts to assign items to the agent who values them the most, while balancing the distribution such that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here's how the allocation might look:

1. Start by allocating each agent the item they value the most, ensuring that no item is double-allocated and that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.
  
2. After each agent has at least one item, allocate the remaining items to maximize the overall happiness (total valuation).

Let's proceed with allocating the items:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly: Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly: Assign item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly: Assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly: Assign item 5 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly: Assign item 2 to agent 4.

Now, each agent has one item. Let's allocate the remaining items (3, 4, 7) to maximize the total valuations:

- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (92). Assign item 3 to agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (64). Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most (66). Assign item 7 to agent 0.

Thus, the final allocation of items is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 3, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly, each agent receives at least one item, and the allocations maximize the agents' valuations.
