Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  85  34  36  17  96  73  26
1  96  17  16  69  70  12  58  52
2  15  28  21  68   0  30  47  32
3  36  11  24  98  86  64  58  76
4  69  22  74  69  50  11  91  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for a balanced distribution based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's analyze the given table and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation for item 5 (96)
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 0 (96)
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 3 (68)
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 3 (98) - conflicting with Agent 2
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 6 (91)

Considering these valuations, let's distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share of high-value items while avoiding conflicts:

- **Agent 0**: Items 5
- **Agent 1**: Items 0
- **Agent 2**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 3**: Items 4, 7
- **Agent 4**: Items 1, 6

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 5, which they value the most.
- Agent 1 gets item 0, matching their highest value.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 3, avoiding conflict over item 3.
- Agent 3 gets items 4 and 7, allowing them to have a fair share.
- Agent 4 receives items 1 and 6, aligning with their highest valuation.

This ensures a fair distribution among the agents while using all 8 items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```
