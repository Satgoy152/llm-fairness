Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26  63  29  89  72  40  31  24
1  27  84  53  44  74  45  96  91
2  54  75  97  85  14  28  86  69
3  78  16  30  48   6  67  51   5
4  96   4  77  73  92  72  58  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 8. We'll aim to distribute these items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations.

Hereâ€™s one way to achieve this:

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued items to agents to ensure fairness and maximize satisfaction.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.
3. Distribute remaining items to balance the allocation.

Let's go through the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (value 89)
- **Agent 1**: Item 6 (value 96)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (value 97)
- **Agent 3**: Item 5 (value 67)
- **Agent 4**: Item 0 (value 96)

Now, each agent has received one item, and three items remain:

- Consider the remaining items 1, 4, and 7.
- Assign the remaining items based on the highest remaining valuations:

  - **Agent 1**: Item 7 (value 91)
  - **Agent 4**: Item 4 (value 92)
  - **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 75)

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation provides each agent with at least one item and distributes the remaining items based on maximizing the sum of the valuations.
