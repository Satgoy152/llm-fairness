Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  56  32  59   8  11  39  38  20
1  21  70  82  26  51  71  69  84
2   3  78  81  75  87  70  24  60
3  10  30  76  73  13  34  21  79
4  68  34  60  44  42  87   4  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness.

Given the table of valuations, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0 has relatively low valuations, so we'll try to give them items where they have relatively higher valuations compared to others.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1, 2, 5, and 7.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 7.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 5.

Let's assign items based on these observations:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 4, as Agent 4 has the highest valuation for it.
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation.
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation.
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 2, who has a high valuation for it.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 2, who has the highest valuation.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 4, as they have the highest valuation.
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0, as they have a reasonable valuation and fewer items.
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 3, as they have the highest valuation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed.
