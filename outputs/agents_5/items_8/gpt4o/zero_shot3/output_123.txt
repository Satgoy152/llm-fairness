Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  14  14  39  64  83  54  39  61
1  53  81  37  34  13  72  17  67
2  45  88  29  22  17  20  71  41
3  60  28  58  18  23  64  11  18
4  72  31  46  20  58   2  78  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, with the goal of maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Initial Allocation:** Start by assigning each agent one item that they value the highest and hasn't been assigned yet. This ensures that every agent gets at least one item.

2. **Remaining Allocation:** Allocate the remaining items based on the next highest available value for each agent, continuing until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- **Agent 0:** Highest value items are 4 (83), 3 (64), 7 (61), 5 (54), ... 
- **Agent 1:** Highest value items are 1 (81), 5 (72), 7 (67), 0 (53), ...
- **Agent 2:** Highest value items are 1 (88), 6 (71), 0 (45), 7 (41), ...
- **Agent 3:** Highest value items are 0 (60), 2 (58), 5 (64), 1 (28), ...
- **Agent 4:** Highest value items are 7 (84), 0 (72), 6 (78), 4 (58), ...

Now, ensure each agent gets at least one highly valued item:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 83).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (value 81).
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 2 (value 71).
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 60).
5. Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (value 84).

Remaining items to allocate: 2, 3, 5.

Allocate the remaining items based on the next highest preference:
- **Agent 0:** Next highest available is item 3 (64).
- **Agent 3:** Next highest available is item 2 (58).
- **Agent 1:** Next highest available is item 5 (72).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [4, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [6]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 2]
- Agent 4: Items [7]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [7]
}
```
