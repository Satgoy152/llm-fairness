Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  99  92  37  13  64  19  57
1  61  73  41   4  31  46  95  69
2  99  24  52  99  76  58  98  94
3  72  28  82  52  98   2  71  14
4  12  89  27  66  39  51  21  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to balance the valuations such that each agent gets a fair share. We can use a method to try and allocate items based on maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items in a way that seems fair:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 1 highly (99), followed by item 2 (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 highly (95), then item 0 (61).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 and item 3 equally (99), then item 6 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 highly (98), then item 2 (82).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 highly (89), then item 3 (66).

Given these preferences, we can try to allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items: 1, 2
- Agent 1 gets items: 6
- Agent 2 gets items: 0, 3
- Agent 3 gets items: 4
- Agent 4 gets items: 5, 7

Let's ensure this allocation is fair by checking each agent's total valuation from the allocated items:

- Agent 0: 99 (item 1) + 92 (item 2) = 191
- Agent 1: 95 (item 6) = 95
- Agent 2: 99 (item 0) + 99 (item 3) = 198
- Agent 3: 98 (item 4) = 98
- Agent 4: 51 (item 5) + 12 (item 7) = 63

This allocation gives each agent a positive and reasonably high total valuation from their allocated items. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures every item is distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
