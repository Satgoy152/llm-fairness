Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  91  75  83   1  30  42  78  85
1  58  15  76  98  24  75  70   6
2   5   3  76  44  98  57  60  41
3  24  76  14  49  65  81  63  26
4  79  55  18  34  22  36  42  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. However, since we have 5 agents and 8 items, at least some agents will receive more than one item.

Here's one possible allocation approach to balance the total value received by each agent:

1. Assign each agent their most valued item first, then distribute the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (91).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (98).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (98).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (81).
- Agent 4 values item 7 the most (99).

After assigning the most valued item to each agent, we have allocated 5 items, leaving 3 items (1, 2, and 6) to be distributed. We can further allocate these based on remaining high values:

- Agent 0 has a high value for item 2 (83).
- Agent 3 has a high value for item 6 (63).
- Agent 4 has a high value for item 1 (55).

This allocation considers both fair distribution and maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents.

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [7, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, and all 8 items are allocated.
