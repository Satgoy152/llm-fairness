Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  62  24   3  48  21  24  51
1  74  31   5  51  62  10  56  82
2   8  17  44  22   3   8  60  19
3  90  16   4   5  73  62  50  17
4  43  15   6  90  52  16  78  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value relatively highly compared to others, while ensuring that all 8 items are allocated in total.

Here's one possible approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If there's a tie, choose the agent with fewer items assigned so far.

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- Item 0 has the highest value from Agent 3 (90).
- Item 1 has the highest value from Agent 0 (62).
- Item 2 has the highest value from Agent 2 (44).
- Item 3 has the highest value from Agent 4 (90).
- Item 4 has the highest value from Agent 3 (73).
- Item 5 has the highest value from Agent 3 (62).
- Item 6 has the highest value from Agent 4 (78).
- Item 7 has the highest value from Agent 1 (82).

Now, let's assign the items based on this analysis:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [0, 4, 5]
- Agent 4: [3, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly and all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4, 5],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items fairly among the agents based on their highest valuations.
