Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  88   5  60  56  25  33  47
1  40  87  98  89  65  21  74  37
2   8  28  33  34  73  29  19  11
3  48  95  56  99  91  26  92  73
4  29  25  82  83  59  80  32  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [29 25 82 83 59 80 32 52]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to allocate the items so that each agent gets an item or items that they value highly.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing the valuation for each agent:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 88.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 98.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 73.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 99.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the highest at 80.

Now, we have allocated 5 out of 8 items, and each agent has received at least one item. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items (0, 6, and 7).

- Agent 0 also values item 0 highly at 50.
- Agent 3 values item 6 at 92.
- Agent 4 values item 7 at 52.

After these allocations, let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value, and all 8 items are allocated.
