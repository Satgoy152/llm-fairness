Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0   6  93  62  16  32  55   0
1  95   0  29  57  41  27  91  74
2  76   7  36  44  50  96  56  44
3  71  82   6  16  48  40  97  93
4  58  99  52  19  80  50  88  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's consider a strategy where each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. We'll try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while also ensuring the overall allocation is balanced.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation**: Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item goes to the agent who derives the most benefit from it.

2. **Adjust to Ensure Fair Distribution**: Since there are 5 agents and 8 items, not every agent will get an item initially. We'll adjust the allocations to ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it at 95, the highest. Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it at 99, the highest. Assign to Agent 4.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 93, the highest. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 62, the highest. Assign to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it at 80, the highest. Assign to Agent 4.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 96, the highest. Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it at 97, the highest. Assign to Agent 3.
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it at 93, the highest. Assign to Agent 3.

Now, let's check the distribution:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: Items [6, 7]
- Agent 4: Items [1, 4]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is balanced.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
