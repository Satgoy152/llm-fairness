Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  20  49  59  88  73  27  43  92
1  34  26  42  20  65   2  53  93
2  20  41  91  44  83  42  82  59
3  53  38  12   4  10  86  79  13
4  38  70  74  28   0  77  14  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy considering the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 3 (88) and item 7 (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 7 (93).
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for item 2 (91) and item 4 (83).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 (86) the most.
5. **Agent 4**: Appreciates item 1 (70) and item 5 (77).

Considering these preferences, we will attempt to allocate the items as follows:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. Assign item 7 to agent 1.
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 4, and 6) while considering the next highest preferences:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 has a reasonable valuation for item 0 (34).
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 has a good valuation for item 4 (73).
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values item 6 (82).

With this allocation, each agent has at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [7, 0],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
