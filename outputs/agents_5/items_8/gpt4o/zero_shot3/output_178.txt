Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  50  33  62  19  24  22  80  43
1  19  62  23   1  71  63  43   9
2  73  21  14  14  71  51  44  60
3  92  38  44  79  21  49   3  36
4  51   6  88  65  43  99  24  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we must consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction. A potential approach is to assign items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Reviewing the valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 6, 2, and 0 highly.
- Agent 1 values items 4, 5, and 1 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 0, 4, and 7 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 0, 3, and 2 highly.
- Agent 4 values items 5, 2, and 7 highly.

Now let's allocate the items:

1. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (highest value).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (second highest value after 4, which is already allocated).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (highest value).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (highest value).
5. Assign item 2 to agent 4 (highest value).
6. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (highest value).
7. Assign item 5 to agent 4 (second highest value after 2, which is already allocated).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 2 (second highest value after 0, which is already allocated).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while considering the preferences of each agent.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```
