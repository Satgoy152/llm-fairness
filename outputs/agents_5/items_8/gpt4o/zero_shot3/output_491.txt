Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0   7  46  24  16  34  97  83
1  97   7  59  98  73  51  62  24
2  89  56  72  97  49  78  59  78
3  53  32  89  98  13  37  68  98
4  89  93  98  90  11  62  26  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 5 agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent gets a portion that reflects their valuations. We need to ensure that every item is allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocations should be based on the highest value preference for this agent. Agent 0 values item 6 highly (97), so allocate item 6 to agent 0. 
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 3 (98), so allocate item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 3 (97), but since item 3 is already allocated, the next highest is item 5 (78). Allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 3 (98), but it is already taken. The next highest is item 7 (98), so allocate item 7 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 2 (98), so allocate item 2 to agent 4.

Continuing this way, we ensure all items are allocated fairly. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2, 0, 1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent receives items according to their high valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
