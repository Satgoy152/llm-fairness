Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  34  62  32   9  45  34  45  90
1   8  69  62  76  83  61  50   5
2  29  49  36  45  88  34  64  72
3  23  78  27  91  18  68  71   0
4  33  95  81   0  94  53  50  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation of items allocated to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair portion of the items. In this scenario, we have 5 agents and 8 items. Therefore, some agents might receive more items than others, but we will strive to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items.
2. Allocate items to agents such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Let's start with calculating the total valuation for each agent:

- Agent 0: 34 + 62 + 32 + 9 + 45 + 34 + 45 + 90 = 351
- Agent 1: 8 + 69 + 62 + 76 + 83 + 61 + 50 + 5 = 414
- Agent 2: 29 + 49 + 36 + 45 + 88 + 34 + 64 + 72 = 417
- Agent 3: 23 + 78 + 27 + 91 + 18 + 68 + 71 + 0 = 376
- Agent 4: 33 + 95 + 81 + 0 + 94 + 53 + 50 + 19 = 425

Using the valuations, we can allocate the items to maximize each agent's benefit:

1. Allocate high-value items to agents that value them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets some items. 

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [7] (value = 90)
- Agent 1: Items [4, 3] (value = 83 + 76 = 159)
- Agent 2: Items [6, 5] (value = 64 + 34 = 98)
- Agent 3: Items [1, 2] (value = 78 + 27 = 105)
- Agent 4: Items [0] (value = 33)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value highly, while distributing all 8 items among the agents.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
