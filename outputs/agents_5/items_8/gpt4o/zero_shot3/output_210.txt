Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  95  67  28  52   5  35  83
1  87  50   1  96  44  34  68  33
2  15  61  85  26  88  45  56  65
3  39  97  94  83  20  97  36  30
4  88  56  18  81  61  29  86  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on each agent's highest valuation for unallocated items.
2. Ensure that each item is allocated to only one agent.

Let's walk through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (95).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (96).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 (88).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 (97), but since it's already allocated, we assign item 5 (97) instead.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0 (88).

Continue allocating based on remaining items and valuations:

- Agent 0 can get item 7 (83) since it has the next highest value after item 1.
- Agent 3 can get item 2 (94) since it has a high value, and agent 3 has already received one item.
- Agent 2 can take item 6 (56) as it maximizes their remaining value.

The allocation would look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items maximizing their individual valuations, and exactly 8 items are allocated in total.
