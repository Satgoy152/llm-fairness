Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  16  64  63  56  52  25  20
1  62   1  60  40  50  98  33  41
2  95  40  56  53  84  40  96  73
3  32  18  33  35   0  60  85  82
4  24  57  28  87  94  89  23  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we aim to allocate items such that agents receive items they value highly, with a consideration to distributing items among agents as evenly as possible.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 2 (64), Item 3 (63)
   - Allocate Items: [2, 3]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value items: Item 5 (98), Item 0 (62)
   - Allocate Items: [5, 0]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: Item 6 (96), Item 4 (84)
   - Allocate Items: [6, 4]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item: Item 7 (82)
   - Allocate Items: [7]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value item: Item 3 (87) - already allocated, next is Item 4 (94) - already allocated. Choose from remaining.
   - Allocate Items: No items left for allocation.

Let's ensure all items are allocated and each agent has an integer number of items:

- Items allocated: [2, 3, 5, 0, 6, 4, 7]
- Remaining item: 1

Adjust allocations to ensure all items are distributed:

1. **Agent 0**: [2, 3]
2. **Agent 1**: [5, 0]
3. **Agent 2**: [6, 4]
4. **Agent 3**: [7]
5. **Agent 4**: [1]

Final allocation to ensure all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents with each agent getting an integer number of items.
