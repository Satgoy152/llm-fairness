Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  31  22  30  49  57  43  71  85
1  20  15   0  33  36  75  37  47
2  54  22  32  81  22   8  59  94
3  48  70  78  68   3  59  56  89
4  24  42  35  12  16  84  80  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives, while ensuring every agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are [31, 22, 30, 49, 57, 43, 71, 85]. High values, especially for item 7. Let's allocate item 7 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are [20, 15, 0, 33, 36, 75, 37, 47]. High value for item 5. Let's allocate item 5 to agent 1. 

3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are [54, 22, 32, 81, 22, 8, 59, 94]. High values for item 3 and 7, but item 7 is already taken. Let's allocate item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are [48, 70, 78, 68, 3, 59, 56, 89]. High values for items 1, 2, and 7. Let's allocate item 1 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are [24, 42, 35, 12, 16, 84, 80, 60]. High values for items 5, 6, and 7, but items 5 and 7 are already taken. Let's allocate item 6 to agent 4.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items. The items left are 0, 2, and 4.

- Agent 2 also has a relatively high valuation for item 0, so let's allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 2, so let's allocate item 2 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 is left with item 4.

So, the allocations will be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
