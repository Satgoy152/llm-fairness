Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  37  50  43  77  82  61  96  78
1  32  87   2  15  83  73  33  36
2   1  82  57  83  23  60   7  81
3  66  72  14  17  50  13  39  95
4  93  47  68  15   2  24  17  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. One approach is to start by assigning the highest-valued item for each agent and then distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuation among all agents.

Let's go through the table and choose allocations that respect these conditions:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 6 (value 96).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 87).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (value 83).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 7 (value 95).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 93).

This initial allocation uses 5 items, leaving us with items 2, 4, and 5 to allocate. We now allocate these remaining items based on the next highest valuations to ensure fairness and cover all items:

- **Agent 2**: Next highest is item 2 (value 57).
- **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 4 (value 82).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest is item 5 (value 73).

Now, let's consolidate these allocations into the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving a fair share based on their valuations.
