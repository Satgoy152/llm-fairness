Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  59  42  85  48  34  11  59  95
1  18  91  52  14  22   9   8  86
2  36  18  21  15  48  94  94  15
3  61   0  30  47  42  48  87  16
4  11  86   8  35  21  82  17  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to balance the total value each agent receives. We'll aim for each agent to get a comparable total value from the items they receive, considering their individual valuations.

Let's proceed with an allocation that attempts to balance these valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2, 6, and 7.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for items 5 and 6.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for items 0 and 6.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for items 1 and 7.

Considering this, let's try the following allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items: 2, 3
- Agent 1 receives items: 1
- Agent 2 receives items: 5
- Agent 3 receives items: 0
- Agent 4 receives items: 4, 6, 7

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 8. Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers the high-value items for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution across all agents.
