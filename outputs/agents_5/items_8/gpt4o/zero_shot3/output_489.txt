Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  99  58  88  35  10  62   3  19
1  49  45  49  33  67  16  59  20
2  82  17   1   9  16  19  47  79
3  59  66  88   3  36  94  41  60
4  66  74  35  21  69  63  43  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is assigned to one agent. This can be a complex problem, but let's attempt a reasonable allocation based on the given valuations.

Let's start by examining the table and then allocate the items based on the highest values, giving preference to agents who value items the most.

1. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 0 (99).
2. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 4 (74).
3. Item 2 has the highest value for Agents 0 and 3 (88). We can assign it to Agent 3 since Agent 0 has already received an item.
4. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 1 (33).
5. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 1 (67).
6. Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 3 (94).
7. Item 6 has the highest value for Agent 1 (59).
8. Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 4 (76).

Now, let's check if every agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 6
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 2, 5
- Agent 4: Items 1, 7

To ensure a fairer distribution, we can reallocate by ensuring every agent (who values at least one item positively) gets at least one item:

1. Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Assign Item 1 to Agent 4.
3. Assign Item 2 to Agent 3.
4. Assign Item 3 to Agent 1.
5. Assign Item 4 to Agent 1.
6. Assign Item 5 to Agent 3.
7. Assign Item 6 to Agent 2.
8. Assign Item 7 to Agent 4.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent who values at least one item positively receives at least one item.
