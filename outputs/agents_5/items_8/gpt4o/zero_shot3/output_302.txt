Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   6  25  55  31  28  81  21  80
1  45  52  78  54  38   8  58  92
2  97  97  73  64  21  88  52  28
3  98   0   8  69  59  36  43  98
4  18   0  69  60  26   1  22  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while also ensuring all items are distributed. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0 and 7, with values 98 each. Allocating these items to Agent 3 maximizes their total value.

2. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values items 1 and 5, both with a value of 97 and 88, respectively. Allocating these items to Agent 2 ensures they receive high-value items.

3. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 2 the most with a value of 78. Allocating item 2 to Agent 1 gives them their highest valued item.

4. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has a high value for item 6, with a value of 21. Allocating item 6 to Agent 0 provides them a valuable item.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 3 the most with a value of 60. Allocating item 3 to Agent 4 maximizes their total value.

6. **Remaining Items**: Items 4 remains, which has not been allocated yet. Agent 1 values item 4 with a value of 38, which is higher compared to other agents.

After the allocation, we ensure that each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the value based on their preferences.
