Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  12  75  69  86  70  54  16  52
1  41  99   2  43  47  25  77  50
2  30  95  73  66  44  98  10  60
3  58  25  55  73  37  83  73  28
4   7  22  86  27  61  12  52   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations for the items. This can be approached as an optimization problem where we try to give each agent the items they value the most while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the most at 86, followed by item 1 at 75. Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the most at 99, but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 6 at 77. Assign items 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 the most at 98. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 at 83, but since it's taken, the next highest is item 7 at 73. Assign item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the most at 86. Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and we need to allocate 2 more. Let's go through the remaining items 0 and 4:

- **Item 0**: Assign it to Agent 3, who values it at 58, the highest remaining valuation for this item.
- **Item 4**: Can be assigned to Agent 2, who values it at 44, the highest remaining valuation for this item.

Now all items are allocated. Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [7, 0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
