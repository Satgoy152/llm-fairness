Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  98  78  90  55  24   5  64  92
1  99  81  58  13  47  92  64  67
2  78   2  40  83  26  16  94  67
3  35  66  51  56  80  22  14  20
4  93  30  37  11  84  67  35  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents with respect to their valuations, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes overall satisfaction. A reasonable approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no agent is over-allocated beyond their fair share of items. Given there are 5 agents and 8 items, each agent should ideally get 1 or 2 items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. **Adjust for fairness**: Make sure each agent gets at least 1 item and at most 2 items. If any agent receives more than 2 items, redistribute to other agents with lower allocations.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Highest valuation by agent 1 (value 99).
- Item 1: Highest valuation by agent 0 (value 78).
- Item 2: Highest valuation by agent 0 (value 90).
- Item 3: Highest valuation by agent 2 (value 83).
- Item 4: Highest valuation by agent 4 (value 84).
- Item 5: Highest valuation by agent 1 (value 92).
- Item 6: Highest valuation by agent 2 (value 94).
- Item 7: Highest valuation by agent 0 (value 92).

Initial allocation based on highest valuations:
- Agent 0: Items [1, 2, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: Item [4]

To ensure fairness, we need to adjust as follows:
- Agent 0 has 3 items. We can move one of their items to Agent 3, who currently has no items. Let's move item 1 to Agent 3.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 4: Item [4]

This allocation ensures fairness, with each agent receiving at least one item and no more than two items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
