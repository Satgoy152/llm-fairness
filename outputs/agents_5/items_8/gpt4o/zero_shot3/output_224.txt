Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  24   6   8  10  56   0  38  62
1  61  29  70  87  18  35  69  99
2  96  93  80  64  83  14  54  43
3  36  99   3   8  59  16  20  98
4  86  32  90  88  53  87  69  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuation to ensure the distribution is as balanced as possible. We'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 7 the most, with a value of 62.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 7 the most, with a value of 99, but since item 7 is already allocated to Agent 0, we look at the second-highest: item 3 with a value of 87.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 the most, with a value of 96.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 1 the most, with a value of 99.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 2 the most, with a value of 90.

Now for the remaining items:

- Items 4, 5, and 6 are unallocated:
  - Agent 2 could take item 4 (value 83) since it maximizes the total allocation value for Agent 2.
  - Agent 4 could take item 5 (value 87) since it maximizes the total allocation value for Agent 4.
  - Agent 0 could take item 6 (value 38) since Agent 0 has a reasonable valuation for it, and it balances the total number of items per agent.

This distribution balances the allocations and considers the highest preferred items for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```
