Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  88  43  73  11  11  23   9  43
1  89  88  47  83  23  17  45  30
2  45  24  10  29  83  12  32  45
3   7  77  89  84  93   9  88  42
4  87  63  92  52  30  25  13  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88 43 73 11 11 23  9 43]
 [89 88 47 83 23 17 45 30]
 [45 24 10 29 83 12 32 45]
 [ 7 77 89 84 93  9 88 42]
 [87 63 92 52 30 25 13 24]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 5 agents based on their valuations, we can consider a method that attempts to maximize the total value received by each agent and ensures that each agent gets approximately an equal share of the total value, while also ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one way to approach this:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items and the total valuation for each item.
2. Sort the items based on their highest valuation by any agent.
3. Allocate items to agents in a way that each agent gets a fair share of their most valued items.

Let's break down the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (88), Item 2 (73)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (88), Item 3 (83)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (83)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (88)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (25), Item 7 (24)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are fairly distributed among the agents, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
