Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  22  96  46   3  21  32   4  76
1  56  37  30  74  22  83  65  55
2  50  38  59  56  34  99  49  94
3   8  42  62   5   9  88  77  80
4  11  50  26  35  69  63   2  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a number of items proportional to their valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given the constraints, we'll try to balance the allocation based on the highest valuations for each item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (56), allocate to Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 (96), allocate to Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (62), allocate to Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 (74), allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by Agent 4 (69), allocate to Agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (99), allocate to Agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 (77), allocate to Agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 (94), allocate to Agent 2.

Now, check the allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item: 1
- Agent 1 gets items: 0, 3
- Agent 2 gets items: 5, 7
- Agent 3 gets items: 2, 6
- Agent 4 gets item: 4

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```
