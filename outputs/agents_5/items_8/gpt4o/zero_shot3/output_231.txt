Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  19  44  91  41  80  67  57  83
1  62  33  32  75  75  40  15  75
2  46  64   8  33  45  36  45   1
3  98  41  59  55  70  60   7   7
4  66  86  38   5  41   4  11  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share. We will aim to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that the distribution of items is balanced.

Let's analyze the valuations table and proceed with the allocations:

1. Look at the highest valuation for each item and assign it to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure that no agent receives more than a fair share of the items if possible.

Here is the step-by-step allocation:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (98). Assign to agent 3.
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by agent 4 (86). Assign to agent 4.
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (91). Assign to agent 0.
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (75). Assign to agent 1.
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (80). Assign to agent 0.
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (67). Assign to agent 0.
- Item 6: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (57). Assign to agent 0.
- Item 7: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (83). Assign to agent 0.

We need to ensure a fair distribution. Agent 0 has too many items in this configuration. Let's adjust to balance:

Reallocation:

- Assign item 5 to agent 3 (60), because agent 3's next highest valuation.
- Assign item 6 to agent 1 (15), because agent 1's next highest valuation.
- Assign item 7 to agent 2 (1), because agent 2 has not received any items yet.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [7]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 4: Items [1]

Here's the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
