Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  10  51  34  60  84  16  65  28
1  96  56  40  27  28   8  71  44
2  98  72  91  63  84  52  63  87
3  60  10  57  85  39  82   2  49
4  90  98  70  89  38  51  77  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10 51 34 60 84 16 65 28]
 [96 56 40 27 28  8 71 44]
 [98 72 91 63 84 52 63 87]

 [90 98 70 89 38 51 77 44]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets roughly an equal opportunity to receive high-value items. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 4, 3
   - Total Value: 84 (item 4) + 60 (item 3) = 144

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 0, 6
   - Total Value: 96 (item 0) + 71 (item 6) = 167

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 2, 7
   - Total Value: 91 (item 2) + 87 (item 7) = 178

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: 5
   - Total Value: 82 (item 5) = 82

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items: 1
   - Total Value: 98 (item 1) = 98

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the total number of items allocated is 8.

Here are the allocations presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
