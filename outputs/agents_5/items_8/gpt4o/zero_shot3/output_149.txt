Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  94  38   9  77  80  38   5  18
1  84  67  17  29  71  38   4  42
2  28  66  99  66  60  74   5  35
3  93  29  37   8  78  28  75  46
4   6  83  80  82  87  31  21  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations. Since there are 5 agents and 8 items, some agents will receive more than one item. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued item for Agent 0 is item 0 (value 94). The next highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 (value 77).

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued item for Agent 1 is item 0 (value 84). However, since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0, we consider the next highest value, which is item 4 (value 71).

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued item for Agent 2 is item 2 (value 99).

4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued item for Agent 3 is item 0 (value 93). However, item 0 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we choose the next highest value, which is item 6 (value 75).

5. **Agent 4**: The highest valued item for Agent 4 is item 4 (value 87). Since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1, we choose the next highest value, which is item 3 (value 82).

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated, and no item is allocated more than once:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 1, 5, 7

This allocation ensures all items are distributed. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 5, 7]
}
```
