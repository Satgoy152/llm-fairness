Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  46  66  85  71  19  65  61  97
1  98  78  57  24  32  74  40  19
2   7   2  28  80  70  72  49  31
3   0  68  84  20  53  62  60   1
4  10  39  55  52  81  38  47   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated in total. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2, 3, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest.
3. **Agent 2** values items 3 and 5 highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 highly.
5. **Agent 4** values items 4 and 5 highly.

Based on this, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (97).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (98).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (80).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (84).
- Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 4 (81, 38).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [4, 5]

Let's allocate the remaining items 1 and 6:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (66) to make Agent 0's allocation more balanced.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (40) since Agent 1 also has a decent valuation for this item.

This ensures each agent receives a fair distribution based on their preferences:

- Agent 0: [7, 1]
- Agent 1: [0, 6]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [4, 5]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
