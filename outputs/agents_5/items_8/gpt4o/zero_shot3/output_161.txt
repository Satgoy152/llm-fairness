Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  51  53  57  45  62  45  78   6
1  28  11  64  24  61  63   0  94
2  36  54  50  33  79  47  87  96
3  71  35  30  35  45  81   9  39
4  91  58  44  46  71  78  25  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the five agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated should be exactly eight. We can use a heuristic approach to balance the allocation based on the agents' valuations.

Let's consider each agent's preferences and try to distribute the items to maximize each agent's total value while ensuring fairness.

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing the total value for each agent:

- Agent 0: Values for items are [51, 53, 57, 45, 62, 45, 78, 6]
- Agent 1: Values for items are [28, 11, 64, 24, 61, 63, 0, 94]
- Agent 2: Values for items are [36, 54, 50, 33, 79, 47, 87, 96]
- Agent 3: Values for items are [71, 35, 30, 35, 45, 81, 9, 39]
- Agent 4: Values for items are [91, 58, 44, 46, 71, 78, 25, 65]

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0, so assign item 0 to agent 4.
2. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 7, so assign item 7 to agent 2.
3. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2, so assign item 2 to agent 1.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5, so assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 6, so assign item 6 to agent 0.
6. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4, so assign item 4 to agent 2.
7. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 1, so assign item 1 to agent 4.
8. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3, so assign item 3 to agent 0.

This allocation gives each agent at least one item while ensuring that all items are fairly distributed based on their preferences.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
