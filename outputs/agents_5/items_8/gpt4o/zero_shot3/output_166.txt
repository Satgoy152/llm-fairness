Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  48  48   9  61  35  46  70  84
1  41  29  77  15   8  38  23   8
2  71   9   9  54  14  26  69  43
3  78  65  14  40  86  98  35   9
4  57  42  21  18  66  59  83  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we allocate items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. This ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most, potentially balancing the overall distribution of satisfaction.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 78.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 65.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the highest at 77.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the highest at 61.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 86.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the highest at 98.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 4 values it the highest at 83.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it the highest at 91.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item. We can adjust the allocations slightly if necessary to achieve this:

- Agents 0, 1, 2, and 4 each have fewer than one item currently. Reallocating some items can balance this out.

Let's finalize these allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 2.
- **Agent 2**: Gets item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Gets items 1, 4, and 5.
- **Agent 4**: Gets items 6 and 7.

This ensures that all agents are included in the allocation process and that all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4, 5],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```
