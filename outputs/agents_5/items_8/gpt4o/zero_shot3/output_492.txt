Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  44  27  61  97   4  51  36  96
1  26  38  69   9  96  29  88  42
2  30  94  82  61  93  55  40  64
3  13  44  32  72  93  56  41  76
4  50  14  58  92  47   2  57  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 38 69  9 96 29 88 42]

 [50 14 58 92 47  2 57 28]]
Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0, as it has the highest valuation for this item (97).
2. Assign item 6 to agent 1, as it has the highest valuation for this item (88).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as it has the highest valuation for this item (94).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 3, as it has the highest valuation for this item (93).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 4, as it has the highest valuation for this item (56).

Now we have three remaining items (0, 2, 7) to allocate among the agents. Let's distribute them considering the next best valuations:

6. Assign item 7 to agent 0, as it has a high valuation (96).
7. Assign item 2 to agent 2, as it has a high valuation (82).
8. Assign item 0 to agent 4, as it increases the overall fairness (50).

After these allocations, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 0]
}
```
