Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  83  19  57  98  43  35  82  90
1  55  47  39  22  60  95  62  64
2  20  32  16  21  13  95  71  67
3  47  66  96  42   1  26  53  19
4  42  63  81  83  19  84  38  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 47 39 22 60 95 62 64]
 [20 32 16 21 13 95 71 67]

 [42 63 81 83 19 84 38 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while also distributing the items as evenly as possible. Each agent should ideally receive either 1 or 2 items because there are 8 items and 5 agents.

Let's analyze the valuation matrix to find a suitable allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (98) and 7 (90).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (95) and 4 (60).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (95) and 6 (71).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (96) and 1 (66).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (83) and 2 (81).

Since some items are highly valued by multiple agents, we need to carefully allocate to ensure fairness while maximizing total valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [3, 7] (total valuation = 188)
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [5] (total valuation = 95)
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items [6] (total valuation = 71)
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items [2] (total valuation = 96)
- **Agent 4**: Allocate items [0, 1, 4] (total valuation = 168)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 8 items are allocated. Here's the final distribution in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
