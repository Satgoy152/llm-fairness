Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  24  19  47   7  75  65  28
1  41  53  17  84  18  63  43  22
2   1  33  18  85   0  74  24  48
3  79  90  99  96  41  79  61  58
4  34   3  73  24  99  61  56  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items. This method is known as the "maximum sum allocation" or "utilitarian" approach.

Let's analyze the table and allocate items accordingly:

1. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. However, since they can only receive one item, we should prioritize the highest value, which is item 2 with a value of 99.
   
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 3, and 5. Among these, item 3 has the highest value of 84.
   
3. **Agent 0** has relatively high valuations for items 1, 3, 5, and 6. Item 5 has the highest valuation of 75.
   
4. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 4 with a value of 99.

5. **Agent 2** has moderate valuations for items 1, 3, 5, and 7. The highest valuation for them is item 7 with a value of 48.

Let's allocate the items based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 4

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item. Now we need to allocate the remaining three items (0, 1, and 6). Let's distribute them based on the highest remaining valuations:

6. **Agent 0** can take item 6 (value 65) as it is the highest remaining for them.
   
7. **Agent 1** can take item 1 (value 53) as it is the highest remaining for them.
   
8. **Agent 4** can take item 0 (value 34), which is the highest remaining option.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 8 items among the 5 agents, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is based on maximizing each agent's valuation.
