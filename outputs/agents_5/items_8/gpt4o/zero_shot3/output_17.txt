Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  86  29  99  14  82  22  86   8
1  64  98   7  36  76   2  14  40
2  34  90  91   1  94  25  41  68
3   0   6  56  91  20  94  24  92
4  21  98   8  29  73  86   5  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Adjust the allocations to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items.

Applying these steps to the given data:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (86).
2. Item 1: Agents 1 and 4 both value it at 98. We can assign it to Agent 1 for diversity.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (99).
4. Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (91).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (94).
6. Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most (94).
7. Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (86).
8. Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most (92).

Now, let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2, 6
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 3, 5, 7
- Agent 4: No items

This allocation gives us a total of 8 items distributed among the agents.

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5, 7],
    "4": []
}
```
