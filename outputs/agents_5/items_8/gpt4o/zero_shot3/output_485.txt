Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  32  42  18  41  45  65  20
1  38  52  35   6  93  81  40  90
2  62  38  54   8  18  25  82  29
3  54  77  29  87  27  76  84  22
4  62  13  75  97   2  95  54  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. A fair allocation could be made by ensuring that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total value while ensuring all items are distributed.

One common approach is to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is maximized, but since the problem asks for a fair allocation, we might also consider an equitable distribution of value. However, the specific fairness criterion isn't defined, so we'll aim for a reasonable distribution that ensures each agent gets at least one item with high personal value.

Let's evaluate the allocation based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly (66).
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly (93).
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly (82).
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly (87).
- Agent 4 values item 3 highly (97), but since item 3 is already taken, we'll consider next highest, items 5 and 7.

Now let's distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Item 0 and since agent 4 took item 5, item 2 is next highest for agent 0 (42).
- Agent 1: Item 4 and item 7 which is second highest (90).
- Agent 2: Item 6 and item 1 next highest for agent 2 (38).
- Agent 3: Item 3 and item 5 as second highest (76).
- Agent 4: Item 5 and item 7 are the highest (both 95), but since item 7 is taken, agent 4 gets item 1.

Re-evaluate to ensure all items are distributed without overlap:

- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [4, 7]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [3, 5]
- Agent 4: [1]

This allocation gives each agent a fair distribution based on their highest preferences and ensures all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
