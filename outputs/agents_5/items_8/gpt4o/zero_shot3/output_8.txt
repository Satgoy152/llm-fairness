Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  26   0  94   6  83   9  42  11
1  21  21  54  42  22  98  84  29
2  49  95  60  82  39   5  49  90
3  16  80  37  21  61  24  26  47
4  97  42  63  92  89  86   4  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [97 42 63 92 89 86  4 89]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that every item is assigned to an agent. The goal is to distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible given the provided valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has strong valuations for items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 7.
- Agent 3 has a good valuation for item 3.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 0 and 6.

Based on this analysis, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 8 items to the agents, considering their preferences as per their valuations.
