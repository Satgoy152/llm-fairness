Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  89  55  26  69  52  71  77   7
1  14  57  53  29  44  81  19  11
2  99  54  90  51  94  88  29  53
3   7  23  93  27  14   9  17  71
4  13  52  55  89  13  84  21  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 8 items to the 5 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the total number of items allocated matches the number of items available.

Let's try to distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 0, 5, and 6.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 5, but it conflicts with Agent 0's high valuation, so we choose the next highest which is item 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuations are for items 0 and 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuation is for item 2, but it conflicts with Agent 2's high valuation, so we choose the next highest which is item 7.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuation is for item 3.

Let's allocate the items based on these valuations:

- Agent 0: 0 (highest valuation among all)
- Agent 1: 1
- Agent 2: 5
- Agent 3: 7
- Agent 4: 3

Remaining items: 2, 4, 6

- Allocating item 2 to Agent 2, who has a high valuation for it.
- Allocating item 4 to Agent 0, who has a high valuation for it.
- Allocating item 6 to Agent 4, who has a moderate valuation for it.

Now let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item.
