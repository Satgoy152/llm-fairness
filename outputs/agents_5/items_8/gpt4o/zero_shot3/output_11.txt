Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  84  40  72  59  26  49  84
1  41  19  64  78  42  95  85  29
2   6  35  42  27   6  57  82   0
3  94  46  98  32  59  16  57  43
4  75  86   0  42  52  48  25  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and distribute the items in a manner that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here is one way to allocate the items fairly based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 0, 1, and 7. We'll assign items 0 and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values items 5 and 6 the most. We'll assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 6 highly. We'll assign item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 2. We'll assign item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 1 highly. We'll assign item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 6 out of 8 items. We need to allocate the remaining two items (3 and 4) to ensure that each agent receives a fair distribution and at least some agents have multiple items if necessary.

6. **Agent 1**: We'll assign item 3 to Agent 1, as they have a relatively high valuation for it.

7. **Agent 3**: We'll assign item 4 to Agent 3, as they have a reasonable valuation for it.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all 8 items are distributed.
