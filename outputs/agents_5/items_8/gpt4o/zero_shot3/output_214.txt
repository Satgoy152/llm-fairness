Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  77   7  23  38  78  36  40  54
1  20  17  59  69  12  26  55  95
2  80  73  22  14  32   7  69  73
3  43  95  12  76  38  81  56  35
4  11  77  41  96  17  70  67  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets at least one item. One approach is to allocate items to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one way to achieve that:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the highest, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
2. Allocate the remaining items by maximizing the overall sum of valuations.

Let's look at the highest values for each agent:

- Agent 0: Highest value is 78 for item 4.
- Agent 1: Highest value is 95 for item 7.
- Agent 2: Highest value is 80 for item 0.
- Agent 3: Highest value is 95 for item 1.
- Agent 4: Highest value is 96 for item 3.

Assign these items first:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 7.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 3.

Now, the remaining items are 2, 5, and 6. We must allocate these to maximize the total valuation:

- For item 2, the highest valuation is by Agent 1 (59).
- For item 5, the highest valuation is by Agent 3 (81).
- For item 6, the highest valuation is by Agent 2 (69).

Assign these items based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed considering the agents' valuations.
