Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  21  90  70  45  93  92  27  53
1   4  90  48  73  15  91  86  20
2  69  34   5   2  55  11  76  73
3  39  27  84  57  96  78  55  69
4  93  38  67  83  26  42  32  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent as equally as possible. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by allocating the items with the highest valuations to the respective agents.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Balance the distribution so that the total value each agent receives is as equitable as possible.

Following these guidelines, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 4, and 5.
- Agent 1 values item 3 and 5 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 7 highly.

With these considerations, here's a fair allocation of the items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 5
- Agent 1: Items 3, 6
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 2
- Agent 4: Items 4, 7

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is fairly balanced based on their valuations.
