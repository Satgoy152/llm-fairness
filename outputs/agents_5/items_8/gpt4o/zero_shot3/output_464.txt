Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  66  21  53  85  98  25  36  17
1  33  43  52  34  62  87  35  94
2  98  76  27  40   2  32  12  20
3  99  65  78  88  26  36  34  37
4  38  31  88  74  36  86  66  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable allocation based on their valuations, while also ensuring all items are distributed. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Identify highest valuations:** Start by identifying the highest valuation for each item among the agents. Allocate the item to the agent who values it the most. If there's a tie, choose based on another criterion, such as an agent who has received fewer items.

2. **Ensure fairness:** After initial allocation based on highest valuations, adjust to ensure each agent has a fair share. Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents may receive more items than others. Aim for as even a distribution as possible.

3. **Adjust allocations:** If an agent gets more than their fair share, consider reallocating some of their items to other agents who are less satisfied.

Following these steps, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items: [0, 3] (values 66, 85)
- Agent 1 gets items: [5, 7] (values 87, 94)
- Agent 2 gets items: [1] (value 76)
- Agent 3 gets items: [2] (value 78)
- Agent 4 gets items: [4, 6] (values 36, 66)

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
