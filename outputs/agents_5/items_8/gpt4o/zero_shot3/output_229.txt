Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  71  42  89  30  35  21  30  79
1  71  60  48   8  93  28  37  49
2  76  68  27  62  78  24  57  30
3  49  82  42  72  25  23  31  32
4  90  91  51  69  34  28  79  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to ensure each agent receives items that maximize their valuations, while also trying to distribute the total number of items evenly as much as possible. Let's proceed with that:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (value 89), Item 0 (value 71).
   - Allocation: [2, 0].

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (value 93), Item 1 (value 60).
   - Allocation: [4, 1].

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (value 76), Item 4 (value 78).
   - Since Item 0 is taken, allocate Item 6 (value 57).
   - Allocation: [6].

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (value 82), Item 3 (value 72).
   - Since Item 1 is taken, allocate Item 3.
   - Allocation: [3].

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (value 91), Item 0 (value 90).
   - Since Items 0 and 1 are taken, allocate Item 5 (value 28) and Item 7 (value 17).
   - Allocation: [5, 7].

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 8 items are distributed among the agents with a focus on maximizing individual agent valuations, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible.
