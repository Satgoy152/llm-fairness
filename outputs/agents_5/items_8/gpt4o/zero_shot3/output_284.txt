Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  38  96  28  37  95  90  44  72
1  87  42  39  87  60  63  54  37
2   4  15  71  54  58  45  78  79
3  96   1  93  32  98  67  11  40
4  25  68  25  76  71  13  38   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item across all agents**:
   - Item 0: Highest value by Agent 3 (96)
   - Item 1: Highest value by Agent 0 (96)
   - Item 2: Highest value by Agent 3 (93)
   - Item 3: Highest value by Agent 4 (76)
   - Item 4: Highest value by Agent 3 (98)
   - Item 5: Highest value by Agent 0 (90)
   - Item 6: Highest value by Agent 2 (78)
   - Item 7: Highest value by Agent 2 (79)

2. **Allocate each item to the agent with the highest valuation**:
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 3
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 4
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 2
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 2

3. **Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is fair**:
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
   - Agent 1: []
   - Agent 2: Items [6, 7]
   - Agent 3: Items [0, 2, 4]
   - Agent 4: Item [3]

4. **Check the total number of allocated items**: 8 items in total.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 2, 4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
