Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  90  14   8  38  55  92  44   3
1   5   6  34  97  56  68  97  75
2  23  55  91  88  57  51  16  92
3  54  89  54  57   9   3  99  21
4  89  56  17  82   4  52  81  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a round-robin approach that considers each agent's preferences and ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign items to the agents based on their highest valuations first.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, given the constraints.
3. Continue assigning items until all items are allocated.

By analyzing the table:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most.

After assigning each agent their most valued item, we proceed to allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations that haven't been assigned yet.

Here's a fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Items 1, 7, 4

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, considering each agent's preferences and ensuring everyone has an integer number of items. Now, let's format this in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 7, 4]
}
```
