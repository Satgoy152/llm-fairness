Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  58  79  73  84  18   0   7  95
1  44  56  31  88  75  84  90  42
2  23  34   0  91  45  79  51  64
3  14  24  32  99  91  74  51  14
4  40  13  32  32  83  63  53  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for the items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has the highest valuation for item 7. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 6 to Agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 to Agent 3, as they highly value it.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 5 to Agent 4, based on their second highest valuation.

For the remaining items (0, 1, 2), we will distribute them based on the remaining agents' highest preferences:

6. **Agent 0**: Assign item 0, as they have the highest remaining valuation for it.
7. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they value it more compared to other agents.
8. **Agent 4**: Assign item 2 to Agent 4, as it balances the distribution and values.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [6, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share of items based on their preferences, while all 8 items are distributed among the 5 agents.
