Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  34  13  66  84  13  32  50
1  40  60  90  86  95  99  44  21
2  18  74  53  94  64  81  33  35
3  89  94  57  26  95  13  88  74
4  41  10  57   8   1  84  65  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 10 57  8  1 84 65 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Review the valuation matrix for each agent and identify the items with the highest values for each agent.
2. Ensure that each item is assigned to one agent only.
3. Balance the allocations so that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's attempt the allocation:

- Agent 0: Values are relatively low compared to others. Assign items with less competition.
- Agent 1: Very high values on multiple items, but we'll prioritize their highest preferences.
- Agent 2: High values on some items, will try to satisfy their highest preferences while considering other agents.
- Agent 3: Has very high values on some items, try to allocate those first.
- Agent 4: Lower values on most items, but we'll try to give them some less competitive ones.

After considering the above, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign item 0 (value 4)
- Agent 1: Assign items 4 (value 95), 5 (value 99)
- Agent 2: Assign item 3 (value 94)
- Agent 3: Assign items 1 (value 94), 6 (value 88), 7 (value 74)
- Agent 4: Assign item 2 (value 57)

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to one agent and respects the relative valuations of each agent.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 6, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```
