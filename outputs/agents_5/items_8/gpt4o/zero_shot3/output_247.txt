Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  55  83  17  74  11  41   1
1  59  32  54   7  76   0  14  13
2  63  78  70  93  22  36  31  98
3  66  53  91  16  50  43  85  25
4  14  30  77  36  57  27  25  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we could use a method that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. One common approach is to iteratively assign the highest valued remaining item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

The table of valuations is as follows:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  81  55  83  17  74  11  41   1
1  59  32  54   7  76   0  14  13
2  63  78  70  93  22  36  31  98
3  66  53  91  16  50  43  85  25
4  14  30  77  36  57  27  25  96
```

To allocate the items, we look for the highest value in the table and allocate that item to the corresponding agent, and then repeat the process for the remaining unallocated items. 

Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Item 7 is valued highest by Agent 2 (value 98). Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
2. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 2 (value 93). Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
3. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 0 (value 81). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
4. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 3 (value 91). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 2 (value 78). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
6. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 1 (value 76). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
7. Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 3 (value 85). Assign item 6 to Agent 3.
8. Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 3 (value 43). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3, 7],
    "3": [2, 5, 6],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures every item is allocated and attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
