Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   0  85   0  35   0  41  49  27
1  20  33  46  91  28  21  81  61
2  32  42  18  98  71   3  37  73
3  60  23  39  38  70  54  28  39
4  16  33  25  27  25  32  72  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them so that the total valuation for each agent is balanced, if possible. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, if possible. This way, we maximize the total satisfaction.

2. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Item 0: Agent 3 (value 60)
   - Item 1: Agent 0 (value 85)
   - Item 2: Agent 1 (value 46)
   - Item 3: Agent 2 (value 98)
   - Item 4: Agent 2 (value 71)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (value 41)
   - Item 6: Agent 1 (value 81)
   - Item 7: Agent 4 (value 87)

3. **Review and Adjust**: After initial allocation, we check if any agent has no items or if the allocation can be more balanced. In this case, Agent 4 is currently assigned only one item. We can try to reallocate where possible to balance the distribution.

4. **Final Allocation**: 
   - Agent 0: Items [1, 5] (values 85, 41)
   - Agent 1: Items [2, 6] (values 46, 81)
   - Agent 2: Items [3, 4] (values 98, 71)
   - Agent 3: Item [0] (value 60)
   - Agent 4: Item [7] (value 87)

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item where possible, balancing the total valuation each agent receives relatively.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7]
}
```
