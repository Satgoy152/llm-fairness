Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  84  63  99  26  36  47  59   5
1  67  37  52   9  35  24  63  86
2  12  23  51  23  37  32  22  86
3  85  84  95  19  69  18  88  90
4  46  33  35  77  60  76  43  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the 8 items among the 5 agents fairly, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent's allocation is an integer. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High Valuation Opportunities:** Look for items that have particularly high valuations by specific agents compared to others. Allocating these items to the agents who value them the most can maximize satisfaction.

2. **Ensure Balanced Distribution:** Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, some agents may receive more items than others. The goal is to distribute items as evenly as possible while maximizing value.

3. **Check for Fairness:** Ensure that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged by the allocation. This may involve comparing the total value each agent receives.

Based on the given valuations, here's a potential allocation that balances fairness and maximizes agent satisfaction:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 2 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 7 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 3, 4 highly.
- Agent 4 values items 5, 6 highly.

Let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 and 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign items 4 and 5 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

This allocation attempts to ensure each agent receives items they value highly while distributing the items fairly.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation uses all 8 items and distributes them across the agents, aiming for an equitable distribution based on the given valuations.
