Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  69  20  46  28  48  89  31  40
1  23  70  90  21   4  15   9  20
2  21  22  68  49  36  39  31  46
3  42  25  56  88  71  28  94  31
4  72  39  63  65  69  44  82  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent can receive an integer number of items. Since there are 8 items and 5 agents, at least 3 agents will receive 2 items, while the others will receive 1 item each. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying which items have the highest value for each agent.
2. Then allocate items to agents ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
3. Balance the allocation to cover all items.

Here's a possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (value 89) and Item 0 (value 69)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (value 90) and Item 1 (value 70)
- Agent 2: Item 6 (value 31)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (value 71) and Item 3 (value 88)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (value 15)

This allocation ensures the items are fairly distributed according to each agent's highest valuation possible given the constraints. Here is the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [7]
}
```
