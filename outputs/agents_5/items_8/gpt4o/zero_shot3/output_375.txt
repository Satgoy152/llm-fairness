Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0   4  92  74  89  16  96  31  62
1  65  55  29  47  85  82  14  76
2  54  33  82  73  39  49  62  87
3  25  38  76  49  47  35  36  17
4  15  10  56  60  42  86  22  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Sort the items for each agent based on their valuations.
2. Allocate the items by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.
3. Consider a balanced distribution of items where each agent gets 1 or 2 items, given there are 8 items and 5 agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (96), so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (65), so assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (82), so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (76), but since item 2 is already taken, assign item 3 (49) to Agent 3, the next highest value.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest (86), but since item 5 is already taken, assign item 3 (60) to Agent 4, the next highest unallocated item.

This leaves items 1, 4, 6, and 7 unallocated. We can distribute these remaining items to balance the allocations:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (value 92).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (value 14).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (value 47).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (value 60).

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations while distributing all 8 items.
