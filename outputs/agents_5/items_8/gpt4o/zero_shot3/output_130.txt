Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  54  37  22  13  70  59  22  17
1  50   6  34  39   1  87  53  36
2   5  65  61  78  64  61  78  76
3   4  72  18  99  95  28  43  33
4  96  93  50  58  55  47  77   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a greedy approach to maximize overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations. We start by considering the highest-valued items for each agent and iteratively allocate them, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 3** highly values item 3 (99) and item 4 (95). Assign these items to Agent 3.
2. **Agent 4** highly values item 0 (96) and item 1 (93). Assign these items to Agent 4.
3. **Agent 1** highly values item 5 (87). Assign this item to Agent 1.
4. **Agent 2** highly values item 6 (78) and item 7 (76). Assign these items to Agent 2.
5. **Agent 0** can take the remaining item 2 (22).

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [6, 7]
- Agent 3: [3, 4]
- Agent 4: [0, 1]

This satisfies the condition that all 8 items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
