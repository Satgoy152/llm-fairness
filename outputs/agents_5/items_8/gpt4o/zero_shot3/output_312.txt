Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 8 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
0  11  25  45  68  27  20  48  91
1  81  12  87   0  84  87  79   4
2  70  50  79  41  91   8  60  79
3  94  19   6   3  63  77  18  27
4  11  67  19  54  42  94  46   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 8 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Choose items that provide the highest valuation for agent 0. The highest valuations are for item 7 (91) and item 3 (68).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Choose items that provide the highest valuation for agent 1. The highest valuations are for item 2 (87) and item 5 (87).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Choose items that provide the highest valuation for agent 2. The highest valuations are for item 4 (91) and item 0 (70).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Choose items that provide the highest valuation for agent 3. The highest valuation is for item 0 (94), but since item 0 is already taken, choose the next highest, which is item 5 (77).

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Choose items that provide the highest valuation for agent 4. The highest valuation is for item 5 (94), but since item 5 is already taken, choose the next highest, which is item 1 (67).

We will ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 6, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, the total number of items is 8, and the allocation considers the highest valuations possible for each agent.
