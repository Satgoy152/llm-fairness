Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  60  17  47  40  84  52  83  96
1  13  71  44  99  34  83  29  23  21
2   6  97   3  91  66   4  26  82  77
3  61  17  86  18  73  26  76  57  64
4  41  23  62  34  77  26  62  19  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use an approach that prioritizes matching agents with items they value highly, while balancing the total number of items each agent receives. The goal is to minimize envy by ensuring each agent feels they receive a fair share based on their own valuations.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 8 highly (96), so we allocate item 8 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 highly (99), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 highly (97), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 2 highly (86), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 4 highly (77), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now we need to allocate the remaining items 0, 5, 6, and 7 in a manner that maintains fairness:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it highest (66), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Agent 0 also has a high valuation (84), so allocate to Agent 0.
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 has a relatively high valuation (76), so allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 has a high valuation (82), so allocate to Agent 2.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, minimizing envy and distributing the total of 9 items among the 5 agents.
