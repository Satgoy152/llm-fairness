Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  35  14  49  43   6  15  68   5
1  83  33  22  61  96  99  51  98  15
2  65  87  18  95   2   3  95  54  27
3  30  62  52  74  21   8  62  23  44
4  21   9  89  77  20  64  82  11  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that we have 5 agents and 9 items, each agent should ideally receive 1 or 2 items. 

We will use a method similar to the envy-free allocation procedure, ensuring each agent's allocation maximizes their utility based on their valuations, while also respecting the constraints.

Let us allocate the items to the agents:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 7 (68)
   - Allocation: [7]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (99)
   - Allocation: [5]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (95)
   - Allocation: [3]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (62)
   - Allocation: [1]

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (89)
   - Allocation: [2]

Now, we have allocated 5 items and need to allocate the remaining 4 items (0, 4, 6, 8).

Continuing with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest among remaining: Item 4 (43)
   - Allocation: [7, 4]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Next highest among remaining: Item 0 (83)
   - Allocation: [5, 0]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Next highest among remaining: Item 6 (95)
   - Allocation: [3, 6]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Next highest among remaining: Item 8 (44)
   - Allocation: [1, 8]

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - All items allocated; no additional allocation needed
   - Allocation remains: [2]

The allocations are now complete, with all 9 items distributed. Each agent receives either 1 or 2 items, and the allocation aims to respect the highest available valuations for each agent.

Final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [2]
}
```
