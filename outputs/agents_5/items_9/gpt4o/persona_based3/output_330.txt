Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  88  19  95  95  60  59  65  16
1  39  45  89  21  38  75  72  96  92
2  37  21  90  97  64  89  75  94  48
3  85  31  50  39  92   3  93   8  86
4   3  31  27  54  13  67  89  31  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own bundle.

One approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "balanced alternation" where agents take turns selecting their most preferred available item.

Given the valuations, let's try to allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: Chooses item 3, as it's valued at 95.
2. **Agent 1**: Chooses item 7, valued at 96.
3. **Agent 2**: Chooses item 3, but it's taken, so they choose item 5, valued at 89.
4. **Agent 3**: Chooses item 6, valued at 93.
5. **Agent 4**: Chooses item 6, but it's taken, so they choose item 5, but it's taken, moving down they choose item 8, valued at 56.

Remaining items are 0, 1, 2, 4.

6. **Agent 0**: Chooses item 4, valued at 95.
7. **Agent 1**: Chooses item 2, valued at 89.
8. **Agent 2**: Chooses item 7, but it's taken, so they choose item 0, valued at 37.
9. **Agent 3**: Chooses item 8, but it's taken, so they choose item 4, but it's taken, they choose item 1, valued at 31.
10. **Agent 4**: Chooses item 2, but it's taken, so they choose item 0, but it's taken, they choose item 1, but it's taken, they choose item 3, but it's taken. Finally, they choose item 1, but since it's taken, they choose item 2, but it's taken, they choose item 0, but it's taken, they choose item 6, but it's taken, finally, they choose item 2, but it's taken, then they choose item 0, but it's taken and finally, they choose item 4, but it's taken.

To allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0**: Chooses item 1.
- **Agent 3**: Chooses item 2.

Ensuring each agent has picked at least one item, the allocations can be finalized. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [7, 2],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [6, 1],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
