Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  49  31  57  33  25  36  71  57
1  75  28  35   2  72  42  13  25  76
2  19  55  52  44   4  14  50  36  62
3  76  20  87  55   3  19  66  36  78
4  78  16  20  13  85  53  22  23  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent feels that they have received at least as much value as they perceive any other agent to have received. Although achieving complete envy-freeness can be challenging in some scenarios, we aim to minimize envy by considering the agents' valuations.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. First, we identify the highest valuations for each agent to ensure that each agent receives at least one item that they highly value.
2. We then distribute the remaining items by attempting to balance the total perceived value for each agent.

### Allocation Steps:

- **Agent 0**: The highest valued items are 3 (57) and 8 (57).
- **Agent 1**: The highest valued items are 0 (75) and 8 (76).
- **Agent 2**: The highest valued items are 8 (62) and 1 (55).
- **Agent 3**: The highest valued items are 8 (78) and 2 (87).
- **Agent 4**: The highest valued items are 4 (85) and 0 (78).

Given these preferences, we need to distribute the items. A possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items 3 and 5
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 6
- **Agent 3**: Items 2 and 7
- **Agent 4**: Items 0 and 8

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items that they have relatively high valuations for and attempts to balance the overall perceived value.

### Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [0, 8]
}
```

This allocation distributes all items among the agents while aiming to minimize envy, given the constraints of the problem.
