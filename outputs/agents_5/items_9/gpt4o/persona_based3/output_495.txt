Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  56  24  25  23  34  61  54  63
1  40  19  67  29  30   6  56  28  78
2  67  12  23  69  62  62  94   4  77
3   4  37  53  17  74  90  46  32  51
4  89  56  54  47  35  14  30  62  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a way that is fair and minimizes envy, we can use a method like the envy-free allocation with integer goods. Since we have 5 agents and 9 items, one possible approach is to try to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent with their allocation while ensuring no agent feels another agent has received more value than they have.

Below is one way to fairly allocate these items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items, and attempt to allocate items to maximize each agent's value with respect to their allocation.
2. Try to ensure each agent receives a roughly equal share of the total value, based on their valuations.

The individual steps for the allocation are as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 0 highly (73), so we can allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 8 highly (78), so we can allocate item 8 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly (94), so we can allocate item 6 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly (90), so we can allocate item 5 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly, but it is already allocated. The next highest valued item for agent 4 is item 1, so we allocate item 1 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated five items. We need to allocate four more items. Let's try to ensure that these allocations maintain a balance:

- Agent 0 can also be given item 3 (value 25) to improve their allocation.
- Agent 1 can also be given item 2 (value 67) to improve their allocation.
- Agent 2 can also be given item 4 (value 62) to improve their allocation.
- Agent 3 can also be given item 7 (value 32) to improve their allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that the overall allocation is close to being envy-free or fair.

Here is the resulting allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [8, 2],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [1]
}
```
