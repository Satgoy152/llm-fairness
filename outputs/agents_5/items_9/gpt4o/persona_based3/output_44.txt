Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  50  97  93  83  33  74  26  68
1  52  97  73  94   3   8  73  19  49
2  44  82  22  59  66  93   8  25  83
3  59  28  14  67  25  86  44  91  99
4  23  80  82  69  33  65  48  96  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free distribution, we can use a method such as the "round-robin" method or the "adjusted winner" procedure. In this scenario, let's use a method that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their highest-valued items first.

We'll start by allocating items to the agents based on their highest preferences until all items are distributed. Here's one way to perform this allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 2 the most (97), so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the most (97), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 the most (93), so we allocate item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 8 the most (99), so we allocate item 8 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 7 the most (96), so we allocate item 7 to agent 4.

After these allocations, we proceed to allocate the remaining items, considering the next highest preferences and ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. The remaining items are 0, 3, 4, and 6.

6. **Agent 0** values item 3 the second most (93), so we allocate item 3 to agent 0.
7. **Agent 1** values item 0 the second most (52), so we allocate item 0 to agent 1.
8. **Agent 4** values item 4 the second most (33), so we allocate item 4 to agent 4.
9. **Agent 2** values item 6 the second most (8), so we allocate item 6 to agent 2.

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has received at least one item. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [7, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest preferences as much as possible while ensuring all items are distributed.
