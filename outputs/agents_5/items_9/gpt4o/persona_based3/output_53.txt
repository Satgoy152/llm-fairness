Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  93  94   5  93  70  44  96  48
1   0  10  22  30  17  61  77  60  85
2  60  56  88  44  96   9  87  52  35
3  67  27  40  48  11  98  81  37  76
4  86  22  83  63  37  71  75  32  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free and equitable distribution. Given that we have five agents and nine items, each agent should ideally receive roughly equal value based on their valuations, while minimizing envy among the agents.

Let's examine the valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share:

1. **Agent 0** values item 1, 2, 4, and 7 very highly. Given that Agent 0 has high values, allocating one of these high-value items will satisfy them.

2. **Agent 1** values item 8 the highest, followed by items 6, 5, and 3. Allocating item 8 to Agent 1 will cater to their highest valuation.

3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4, followed by item 2 and item 6. Giving item 4 to Agent 2 would be ideal.

4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest, followed by item 6 and item 8. Allocating item 5 to Agent 3 will satisfy them.

5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the highest, followed by item 8 and item 2. Giving item 0 to Agent 4 would be appropriate.

Now, we proceed with the allocation:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

We still have items 1, 2, 3, and 6 left. Let's distribute these remaining items to ensure all agents receive items and achieve overall fairness:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values item 1 highly).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (since Agent 3 values item 6 highly).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 also values item 2).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values item 3).

This allocation ensures each agent receives some items and that the distribution is relatively fair based on the valuations provided. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents.
