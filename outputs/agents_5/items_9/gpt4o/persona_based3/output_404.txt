Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  88  91  82  74  19  30   3   0
1  82  51   6  35   7  63  15  74  94
2  57  34  37  19  58  58  49  62  48
3  49  83  16  48  44  39  69  68  83
4  66   6  10  88  67  79  93  69  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraint of each agent receiving an integer number of items. The envy-free condition means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation to their own.

One approach is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "balanced alternation" that focuses on fairness by considering each agent's preferences iteratively. However, given the complexity of human-like fairness and the integer constraint, a perfect solution may not always be possible without a more intricate mechanism like the adjusted winner procedure or other fair division algorithms.

Let's perform an initial allocation by considering the value distributions:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items one by one, trying to maximize fairness and minimize envy.

Here is an allocation that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. Agent 0 values items highly and can be initially given highly valued items.
2. Agent 1 also has high-value perceptions but different preferences.
3. Agents 2, 3, and 4 have varied preferences that can guide item allocation.

After considering these aspects, here's a proposed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation considers the high-value preferences of each agent and attempts to distribute the items so that no agent feels significantly envious of another's allocation. Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
