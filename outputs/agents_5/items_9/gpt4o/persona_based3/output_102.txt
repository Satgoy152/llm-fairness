Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  16  40   4  44  22  79  55  74
1  85  99  55  44  37  18  87  43   5
2  68   4  91  33   4   3  61  93  46
3  40  13  38  42  18  27  68  21   1
4  77  44  38  13  20  68   9   5  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all 9 items being allocated. A common approach in fair division is to use the "Envy-Free up to one item" (EF1) criterion, which allows for a feasible division in many practical situations.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Allocation**: Start by giving each agent one item that they value highly.
2. **Redistribution**: Adjust allocations to ensure that, if possible, no agent envies another agent's allocation more than one item.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 6 the most (79), so allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the most (99), so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the most (91), so allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 next after agent 0 (68), but it's already taken. Allocate item 3 (42) to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 the most (68), so allocate item 5 to agent 4.

After the first round, each agent has been allocated one item. Now distribute the remaining items (0, 4, 7, 8) to balance the allocations and maintain fairness.

6. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 0: Allocate to Agent 1 (second-highest value after item 1).
   - Item 4: Allocate to Agent 0 (second-highest value after item 6).
   - Item 7: Allocate to Agent 2 (second-highest value after item 2).
   - Item 8: Allocate to Agent 0 (high value and balancing number of items).

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 8],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations, and we've used all items. The allocation aims to be as fair as possible given the constraints.
