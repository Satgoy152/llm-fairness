Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  38  53  17  85  45  10  99  12
1  44   2  39  17  71  97  69  29   5
2  66  51   5   8  61  52   2  77  39
3  99  23  94  88  75  26  69  72  28
4  82   6  37  92  86   0  89   9  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we should aim for an envy-free allocation where each agent is satisfied with their allocation, given their valuations. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

Here's a potential allocation that seeks to balance the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values item 7 (99). We will allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (97). We will allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (66). We will allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 0 and item 2 highly but since item 0 is already taken, we will allocate item 2 (94) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (92). We will allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to continue allocating the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 also values item 4 highly (85), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 8 (39) more than the remaining items, so we allocate item 8 to Agent 2.
8. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 6 (69) more than the remaining items, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
9. **Agent 4**: Finally, Agent 4 values item 1 (6) and item 9, but since item 1 is available, we allocate this to Agent 4.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [3, 1]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one of their top-valued items, helping to minimize envy across agents. Additionally, all items are allocated.
