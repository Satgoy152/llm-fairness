Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55   3  52  34  97  35  51  18  35
1  42  22  97  80  97  61  39  68  77
2  39  51  58  13  28  14   4  92  36
3  11  33  98  79  93  23  25  22  11
4  93  23  96  33  74  26  32  12  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation as much as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, given their individual valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the provided valuations:

1. **Identify the highest value item for each agent and allocate it if possible.**
2. **Ensure each agent gets a fair share by considering their next highest valued items.**

Let's proceed with this strategy:

- Agent 0 has the highest value (97) for item 4.
- Agent 1 has the highest value (97) for items 2 and 4; since item 4 is taken, allocate item 2.
- Agent 2 has the highest value (92) for item 7.
- Agent 3 has the highest value (98) for item 2, but since item 2 is taken, allocate item 4 (93).
- Agent 4 has the highest value (96) for item 2, but since it's taken, allocate item 0 (93).

Now let's allocate the remaining items while trying to maintain fairness:

- Agent 0: Already has item 4, next highest is item 0 (55).
- Agent 1: Already has item 2, next highest is item 4 (97) but it's taken; then item 8 (77).
- Agent 3: Already has item 4, next highest is item 2 (98) but it's taken; then item 3 (79).
- Agent 4: Already has item 0, next highest is item 2 (96) but it's taken; then item 8 (61).

This allocation leaves us with items 1, 5, and 6 to be assigned. Let's distribute these:

- Agent 2: Already has item 7, next highest is item 1 (51).
- Agent 3: Already has items 4 and 3, next highest is item 5 (23).
- Agent 0: Already has items 4 and 0, next highest is item 6 (51).

Let's summarize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0, 6],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [7, 1],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items (some agents may receive no items, as seen with agent 4), and all 9 items are allocated.
