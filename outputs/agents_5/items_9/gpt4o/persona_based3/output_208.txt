Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  47  72  77  95  21   2  99  96
1  24  48   5  60  91  13  41  78  80
2  72  52  93  77  27   3  73  78  55
3  48  85  57  80  92  42  63  83  92
4  92  26  86  29  81  64   8   0  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an allocation where no agent envies another agent's bundle of items. One approach is to use the Envy-Free (EF) allocation strategy, which attempts to allocate items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

Given the valuations, we can use the following steps to determine an EF allocation:

1. **Initial Distribution:** Begin by distributing items based on each agent's highest valuation to minimize envy. Each agent should initially receive the item they value the most that hasn't been allocated yet.

2. **Adjustment for Fairness:** After the initial allocation, adjust the distribution to ensure that any envious situations are minimized or resolved. If an agent values another agentâ€™s bundle more than their own, attempt to swap items or reallocate to reduce envy.

3. **Iterate and Adjust:** Continue the process iteratively to ensure as close to envy-freeness as possible, considering that perfect envy-freeness might not always be feasible with integer allocations.

Based on this approach, let's allocate the items using a heuristic method:

### Allocation Process:

1. **Initial Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Values item 7 the most (99), allocate item 7.
   - Agent 1: Values item 4 the most (91), allocate item 4.
   - Agent 2: Values item 2 the most (93), allocate item 2.
   - Agent 3: Values item 8 the most (92), allocate item 8.
   - Agent 4: Values item 0 the most (92), allocate item 0.

   At this point, items 1, 3, 5, and 6 remain unallocated.

2. **Adjust for Remaining Items:**
   - Consider remaining items and the next highest values for each agent to fill the allocations.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (second highest for Agent 3 at 85).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest for Agent 0 at 77).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 4 (next highest for Agent 4 at 64).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2 (next highest for Agent 2 at 73).

### Final Allocations:

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [8, 1],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with attempts made to minimize envy. Note that some adjustments might still be needed in practice for perfect envy-freeness, but this allocation provides a balanced distribution based on initial valuations.
