Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  86  59  11  55   6  58  20  38
1  48  11  92  53  63  26   1  22   0
2   6  17  96  96   1  72  26  57  71
3  30  93  76   9  11  84  73  66  22
4  31   3  55  77  50   8  98  81  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation for the items. A common approach to achieve a fair division is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining items. This doesn't always guarantee envy-freeness, but it's a practical method to achieve fairness in terms of maximizing individual valuations.

Let's simulate this process step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0** picks item 1 (value 86).
2. **Agent 1** picks item 2 (value 92).
3. **Agent 2** picks item 3 (value 96).
4. **Agent 3** picks item 5 (value 84).
5. **Agent 4** picks item 6 (value 98).
6. **Agent 0** picks item 0 (value 44).
7. **Agent 1** picks item 4 (value 63).
8. **Agent 2** picks item 8 (value 71).
9. **Agent 3** picks item 7 (value 66).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
