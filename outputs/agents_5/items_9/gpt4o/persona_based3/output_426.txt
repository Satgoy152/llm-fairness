Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  15   4  32  16  11  55  61  40
1  88  40  26  73  21  94  18  11  63
2  36   8  71  39  36  34  44  29  40
3  89  50   5  37  40  43  32  50  57
4   5  60  40   2  43  76   1  70  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. We will use an approach that attempts to maximize the minimum valuation each agent receives, which can often lead to envy-free allocations if possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent has different valuations for the items.
   - We want to ensure that each agent feels they are getting a fair allocation based on their preferences.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - We will use a simple heuristic approach to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations first, and then adjust to ensure each agent gets a fair share.

3. **Fair Allocation**:
   - We will start by allocating items that have the highest unique valuation for any agent to that agent.
   - Then, we will proceed with the next highest valuations until all items are allocated.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Highest unique valuation for item 6 (55).
- **Agent 1**: Highest unique valuation for item 5 (94).
- **Agent 2**: Highest unique valuation for item 2 (71).
- **Agent 3**: Highest unique valuation for item 3 (37).
- **Agent 4**: Highest unique valuation for item 5 (76) already allocated, next unique is item 1 (60).

Now, we have:
- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1]

Remaining items: 0, 4, 7, 8

Next, allocate remaining items considering maximizing the minimum valuation:

- **Item 0** (65) goes to Agent 3 (89 is highest valuation).
- **Item 4** (16) goes to Agent 0 (16 is highest valuation).
- **Item 7** (61) goes to Agent 0 (61 is highest valuation).
- **Item 8** (63) goes to Agent 1 (63 is highest valuation).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [6, 4, 7]
- Agent 1: [5, 8]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3, 0]
- Agent 4: [1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations and attempts to balance fairness across all agents.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4, 7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [1]
}
```
