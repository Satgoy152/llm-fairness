Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  13  30  80  28  94  53  92  52
1  24  54  92  87  37  95   5  47  70
2  91  86  58  40  92  30   0  26  61
3  29  80  29  16  52  41  23  13  98
4  88  88   1  60  96  92  82  13  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible distribution, where each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the constraints and valuations, we can use a greedy algorithm to assign items to agents based on their preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Evaluate which item each agent values the most and try to assign it to them if possible.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if feasible.
3. Balance the allocation to avoid significant envy.

Using this approach, an example allocation could be:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (value 94).
- Agent 1 highly values item 5 but since it is already assigned, they are assigned item 2 (value 92).
- Agent 2 highly values item 0 (value 91).
- Agent 3 highly values item 8 (value 98).
- Agent 4 highly values item 4 (value 96).

Continue allocating the remaining items based on the next highest preferences and trying to balance the distribution:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest value after item 5).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest value after item 2).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (next highest value after item 4).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (as Agent 0 has space for more items and moderately values it).

The resulting allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3, 7],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to give each agent their most valued item where possible and distributes the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives according to their valuations.
