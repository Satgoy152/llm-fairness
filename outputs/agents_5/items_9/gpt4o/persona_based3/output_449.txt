Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  12  80  76  64  12  53  50  69
1  74  47  73  46  19  17  91  16  77
2  75  69  88  34   3   5  68  37  16
3  81  20  38  47  60   4  62  21   7
4  71  16  90  60  26  53  99  87  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items. There are various fair division methods, but given that we have to allocate all 9 items and each agent should receive at least one item, we can employ a simple algorithm by considering each agent's highest preferences first or using a round-robin allocation method based on preferences.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation Items for Each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: Item 2 (80)
   - Agent 1: Item 6 (91)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (88) - Already taken, next best is Item 0 (75)
   - Agent 3: Item 0 (81) - Already taken, next best is Item 4 (60)
   - Agent 4: Item 6 (99) - Already taken, next best is Item 2 (90)

2. **Allocate Based on Highest Preferences**:
   - Given the conflicts above, let's allocate iteratively respecting highest remaining preferences while avoiding conflicts.

3. **Iterative Assignment**:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 2.
   - Agent 1 gets Item 6.
   - Agent 2 gets Item 0.
   - Agent 3 gets Item 4.
   - Agent 4 gets Item 7.

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Remaining items: 1, 3, 5, 8
   - Assign these based on remaining highest preferences:
     - Agent 0: Item 8
     - Agent 1: Item 3
     - Agent 2: Item 1
     - Agent 3: Item 5

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Ensure all items are allocated and no agent envies another based on their received items.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to consider each agent's preferences and ensure that all items are distributed fairly among the agents. Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items matches the requirement.
