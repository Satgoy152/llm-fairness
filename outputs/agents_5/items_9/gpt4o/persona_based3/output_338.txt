Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26   2  86  96  12  36  59  46  68
1  12  24  54  69   4  20   9   7  97
2  69  80  10  83  63  48   3  94  19
3  75  55  84  52  33  37  40  63  67
4  85  23  89  64  48  98  66  73  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we must consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Given the constraints and the need to allocate all 9 items, let's proceed with a strategy to achieve this.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**  
   Compute the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand how much value they perceive in the entire set of goods.

2. **Prioritize High-Value Items:**  
   Identify which items have the highest individual valuations and find ways to assign them where they provide the most perceived value.

3. **Iteratively Assign Items:**  
   Start with the highest-valued items, assigning them to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent ends up with a set of items that they value significantly.

4. **Ensure Envy-Freeness:**  
   Attempt to allocate items such that no agent envies another's allocation based on their valuation.

### Allocation Steps:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (96), so we assign it to them.
- **Agent 1** highly values item 8 (97), so we assign it to them.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 7 (94), so we assign it to them.
- **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (75), so we assign it to them.
- **Agent 4** highly values item 5 (98), so we assign it to them.

With these high-value items allocated, we distribute the remaining items to balance the total perceived value for each agent:

- Assign item 2 to **Agent 0** (86).
- Assign item 4 to **Agent 2** (63).
- Assign item 6 to **Agent 3** (40).
- Assign item 1 to **Agent 4** (23).

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to satisfy the constraints of distributing all items, maintaining integer item counts, and addressing individual agent valuations to minimize envy.
