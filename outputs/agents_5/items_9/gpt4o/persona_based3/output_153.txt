Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  31  63   5  62  71  42  18  76
1  40  93  62  34  56  85  25   7  42
2  89  60  57  82  86  46  89  55   8
3  29  95  34  67  73  20  27  39  37
4  51  48  54   4  69  53  86  19  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we can use the method of selecting items in a round-robin or sequential manner based on each agent's highest valuation for the remaining items. This doesn't guarantee perfect envy-freeness but can help in achieving a relatively fair distribution.

### Step-by-step Allocation Process:
1. **Initialization**:
    - Each agent starts with no items.
    - Track which items have been allocated.

2. **Round-Robin Allocation**:
    - Iterate through the agents in a round-robin fashion.
    - On each agent's turn, allocate the item they value most among the remaining unallocated items.

3. **Stopping Condition**:
    - Stop when all items have been allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value for item 0 (value 90). Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 1 (value 93). Allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value for item 6 (value 89). Allocate item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 1, but already taken, next highest for item 3 (value 67). Allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 6, but already taken, next highest for item 4 (value 69). Allocate item 4 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 0**: Highest value among remaining items for item 5 (value 71). Allocate item 5 to agent 0.
7. **Agent 1**: Highest value among remaining items for item 2 (value 62). Allocate item 2 to agent 1.
8. **Agent 2**: Highest value among remaining items for item 7 (value 55). Allocate item 7 to agent 2.
9. **Agent 3**: Highest value among remaining items for item 8 (value 37). Allocate item 8 to agent 3.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed. While it may not be perfectly envy-free, it provides a reasonable distribution given the constraints.
