Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  58  69   4  34  18  70  78  12
1  24  18  76  84  13  69  60  46  14
2  44  78  41  63  31  73   7  28  15
3  73  72  28  88  84  15  23  23  49
4  52  45  39  50  56  65  20  59  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division that is envy-free (as much as possible given the constraints), we need to allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents while ensuring that each agent feels that they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given that each agent's valuation is different, the challenge is to balance the allocations so that each agent feels satisfied with their allocation relative to others. 

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items to understand their relative valuations:
   - Agent 0: 36 + 58 + 69 + 4 + 34 + 18 + 70 + 78 + 12 = 379
   - Agent 1: 24 + 18 + 76 + 84 + 13 + 69 + 60 + 46 + 14 = 404
   - Agent 2: 44 + 78 + 41 + 63 + 31 + 73 + 7 + 28 + 15 = 380
   - Agent 3: 73 + 72 + 28 + 88 + 84 + 15 + 23 + 23 + 49 = 455
   - Agent 4: 52 + 45 + 39 + 50 + 56 + 65 + 20 + 59 + 33 = 419

2. Allocate high-value items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring a fair distribution across all agents.

3. Below is a possible allocation that attempts to balance the value each agent receives:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 6].
- Agent 1 gets items [3, 5].
- Agent 2 gets items [1, 8].
- Agent 3 gets items [2, 4, 7].
- Agent 4 gets no items but is included in the allocation.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [2, 4, 7],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to provide each agent with items they highly value, while ensuring that all items are distributed. Note that even though Agent 4 receives no items, their absence from active allocation could be addressed in a real scenario through additional compensatory mechanisms, if needed.
