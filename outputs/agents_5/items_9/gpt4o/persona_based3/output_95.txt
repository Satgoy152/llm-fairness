Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  10  14  37  26  90   1  21  82
1  34  70  51  14  57  48  21  31  80
2  55  82   1  98  73  51  86  33  13
3  58  56  58  84  74  70  69   9  57
4  30  99  91  47  21  22  30  80   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider a fair division method, like the envy-free allocation, where no agent should envy another's allocation given their valuations.

The given valuations are:

```
Agent 0: [46, 10, 14, 37, 26, 90, 1, 21, 82]
Agent 1: [34, 70, 51, 14, 57, 48, 21, 31, 80]
Agent 2: [55, 82, 1, 98, 73, 51, 86, 33, 13]
Agent 3: [58, 56, 58, 84, 74, 70, 69, 9, 57]
Agent 4: [30, 99, 91, 47, 21, 22, 30, 80, 5]
```

We want to allocate all 9 items to the 5 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items and no agent envies the others' allocations, if possible.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

1. **Item 0**: Most valued by Agent 2 (55), allocate to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: Most valued by Agent 4 (99), allocate to Agent 4.
3. **Item 2**: Most valued by Agent 4 (91), allocate to Agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: Most valued by Agent 2 (98), allocate to Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Most valued by Agent 3 (74), allocate to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Most valued by Agent 0 (90), allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Most valued by Agent 2 (86), allocate to Agent 2.
8. **Item 7**: Most valued by Agent 4 (80), allocate to Agent 4.
9. **Item 8**: Most valued by Agent 1 (80), allocate to Agent 1.

The allocations ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, reducing envy.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0, 3, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 2, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes the items in a way that respects the agents' valuations as much as possible, aiming for an envy-free allocation.
