Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  22  65  76  30  96  66  48  92
1  14  82   4  94  99  52  32  68   5
2  78  96   2  73  69  22  79  50  16
3   4  81  68   7  60  73  97  23  98
4  52  37  71  96  47  81  28  75  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we aim to achieve a distribution where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. This problem can be quite intricate, but we can attempt to find a reasonable solution by considering each agent's valuation and ensuring that the overall distribution is as balanced as possible.

Here's one possible allocation that seeks to balance the preferences and valuations of each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items with high valuations like 5 and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the highest, and second highest is item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high value for item 1 and item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 8 and item 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Has a high valuation for items like 3 and 5.

Given these preferences, a potential fair allocation could be:

- **Agent 0**: Items [5, 8]
- **Agent 1**: Item [4]
- **Agent 2**: Items [0, 1]
- **Agent 3**: Items [6, 7]
- **Agent 4**: Items [2, 3]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. The allocation attempts to respect the valuations of the agents as much as possible.
