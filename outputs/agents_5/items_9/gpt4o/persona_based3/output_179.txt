Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  63  18  57   6  75  45  56  72
1  66  43  65  34  10  72  55  74  61
2  79  44  78  83   5  80  79   6   2
3   0  20  44  47  69  58  60   3  15
4  33  93  95  92  50  93   9  70  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for a division that is as envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle, given their valuations.

We have 5 agents and 9 items to distribute. We'll try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's satisfaction according to their valuations, ensuring that the total number of allocated items is 9.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: They highly value item 5 (75) and item 8 (72), so we allocate these items to them.
2. **Agent 1**: They highly value item 7 (74) and item 5 (72), but since item 5 is already taken, we allocate item 7 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: They highly value item 3 (83) and item 0 (79), so we allocate these items to them.
4. **Agent 3**: They highly value item 6 (60) and item 5 (58), but since item 5 is already taken, we allocate item 6 to them.
5. **Agent 4**: They highly value item 2 (95) and item 1 (93), so we allocate these items to them.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 9.
