Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  48  55  61  90   0   3   2  84
1  72  40  94   7  91  55  57  37  18
2  51  11  97  50  40  69  50  34  19
3  93  85  76  45  60  89  45  26  76
4  79  82  83   1  53  27  94   1  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that no agent feels another has received a better bundle of items. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation items for Agent 0 are item 4 (value 90) and item 8 (value 84). We assign item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 2 (value 94). We assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 2 (value 97), but it is already assigned to Agent 1. Next highest is item 5 (value 69). We assign item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 0 (value 93). We assign item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 6 (value 94). We assign item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, we ensure that all items are distributed:

6. **Remaining items**: Items 1, 3, 7, and 8 need to be allocated.

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 3 values item 1 at 85, the highest among others. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

- **Item 3**:
  - Agent 0 values item 3 at 61, the highest among others. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

- **Item 7**:
  - Agent 2 values item 7 at 34, the highest among others. Assign item 7 to Agent 2.

- **Item 8**:
  - Agent 3 values item 8 at 76, the highest among others. Assign item 8 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it most highly among those not yet assigned that many items, promoting fairness and reducing envy.

Here's the final allocation of items:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 1, 8],
    "4": [6]
}
```
