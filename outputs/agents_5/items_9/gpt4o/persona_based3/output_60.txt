Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  28  96  95  83   8  10  51  23
1  87  25  86   2  26  64  76  60  62
2  40  11  18   1   6  56  55  88  19
3  38  32  17  39  26  75  72  59   6
4   3  87  36  67  84  49  71   6  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [87 25 86  2 26 64 76 60 62]
 [40 11 18  1  6 56 55 88 19]
 [38 32 17 39 26 75 72 59  6]
 [ 3 87 36 67 84 49 71  6 47]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents so that each agent receives an integer number of items, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness. Envy-freeness ensures that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent over their own based on their valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

```
Valuations Table:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  28  96  95  83   8  10  51  23
1  87  25  86   2  26  64  76  60  62
2  40  11  18   1   6  56  55  88  19
3  38  32  17  39  26  75  72  59   6
4   3  87  36  67  84  49  71   6  47
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Agent 0**: High value on item 2 (96), item 3 (95), item 4 (83).
2. **Agent 1**: High value on item 0 (87), item 2 (86), item 6 (76).
3. **Agent 2**: High value on item 7 (88), item 5 (56), item 6 (55).
4. **Agent 3**: High value on item 5 (75), item 6 (72), item 7 (59).
5. **Agent 4**: High value on item 1 (87), item 4 (84), item 6 (71).

### Proposed Allocation:
- Assign high-value items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share of their high-value items.

#### Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: [2, 3] (Most valued items)
- **Agent 1**: [0, 6] (High valued by agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: [7] (Unique high value)
- **Agent 3**: [5] (High value item)
- **Agent 4**: [1, 4, 8] (High value on 1 and 4, additional item 8 for balance)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value highly, and no items are left unallocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 4, 8]
}
```
