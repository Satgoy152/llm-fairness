Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6   0  81  50  15  65  99  76  75
1  89  70  58  17  94  47  23  13  24
2  20  57  80  55  33  58  50  40  60
3  92  78  67  96  84  43  32  97   3
4  91  99  61  64  95  99  40  50  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

One approach to achieve a fair division is to use a method like "round-robin" or "sequential allocation," where agents take turns choosing their most valued available item. However, given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, we'll aim for a solution that minimizes envy to the extent possible.

Here's a possible allocation of the items based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 6, 7, and 8.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 0 and 4.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 the most.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 3 and 1.
5. **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 5.

Given these preferences, we'll allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [6, 7]
- Agent 1: [0, 4]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [1, 3, 8]
- Agent 4: [5]

This allocation considers the highest preferences of each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, balancing the distribution according to their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 3, 8],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated and considers the agents' preferences to minimize envy.
