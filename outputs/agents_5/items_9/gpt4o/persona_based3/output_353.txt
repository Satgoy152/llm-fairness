Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  66   1  29  42  60  67   3  89
1  64   6  73  70  53   0  85  89  64
2  91  96  77   2  69  26  90  78  92
3  30  96  63  63  82  83  64   0  91
4   4  99  61  63  90  92   4  31  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve the problem of fairly allocating the 9 items among the 5 agents, we aim to ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation more than their own. A common approach to achieve this is to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly.

### Steps to Achieve Fair Allocation:

1. **Determine Total Valuations:**
   Calculate the sum of each agent's valuation for all items to understand their overall preferences.

2. **Maximize Individual Satisfaction:**
   Assign each item to the agent who values it the most to maximize individual satisfaction and overall utility.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:**
   Ensure that each agent receives at least one item where possible and balance allocations to avoid significant envy.

### Implementation:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 8 highly, followed by item 6.
- **Agent 1:** Strong preference for item 7.
- **Agent 2:** Prefers item 1 and 8.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 1 and 5 significantly.
- **Agent 4:** Strong preference for item 1 and 5.

By analyzing the preferences, we allocate the items to balance the envy-free condition as much as possible.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
}
```

In this allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives item 6, which they value highly.
- **Agent 1** receives item 7, aligning with their preferences.
- **Agent 2** is allocated item 8, which they value significantly.
- **Agent 3** gets item 5, a high-value item for them.
- **Agent 4** receives items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, balancing the high cumulative value they receive.

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction while distributing items in a way that reflects their preferences and minimizes envy.
