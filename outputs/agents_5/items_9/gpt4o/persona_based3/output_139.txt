Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  51  13  36  99  30   2  33  15
1  59  29  77  34  27  93  12  50  28
2   7   2  40  52  70   5  68  47  65
3  71  27  47  82  57  84  28  54  72
4  24   6  87  19  40  50  87  44  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, meaning each agent should prefer their own allocation over others or at least value them equally. A common approach involves using the "round robin" method based on valuations.

Let's start by considering the total number of items (9) and distributing them as evenly as possible among the 5 agents. Each agent should aim to receive either 1 or 2 items.

Here is one possible allocation that attempts to be fair based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 4, so we allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 5, so we allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 6, so we allocate item 6 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 3, so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 2, so we allocate item 2 to agent 4.

Now, each agent has received one item. We continue the allocation:

6. Agent 0's next highest valuation is item 0, so we allocate item 0 to agent 0.
7. Agent 1's next highest valuation is item 2, but it's already allocated. The next is item 7, so we allocate item 7 to agent 1.
8. Agent 2's next highest valuation is item 8, so we allocate item 8 to agent 2.
9. Agent 3's next highest valuation is item 5, but it's already allocated. The next is item 8, but it's also allocated. The next is item 0, but it's allocated. Finally, we allocate item 1 to agent 3.

This allocation leaves agent 4 with only one item, but it is a difficult scenario with more agents than items. The allocations attempt to balance fairness and envy-freeness as much as possible.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
