Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  55  26  47   7  79  22  87   1
1  93  37  38  46  91  28  28  53  56
2  72  36  70  83  30  22  67  15   2
3  84  58  46  46  90   8   3  20  57
4  49  22  91  50   8   4  86  97  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents such that the allocation is fair and envy-free as possible, we can use a method like the "Round Robin" procedure or other fair division techniques. However, given the constraints and the discrete nature of the problem (items cannot be split), we will aim for an allocation that maximizes the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.

To achieve this, we should consider the following approach:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to agents, prioritizing items that have the highest value for a particular agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items without exceeding the total number of items.

Let's analyze the agents' valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items as 85 (item 0) and 87 (item 7) highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 93 (item 0) and 91 (item 4) highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Values items 83 (item 3) and 72 (item 0) highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 84 (item 0) and 90 (item 4) highly.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 97 (item 7) and 91 (item 2) highly.

Following these observations, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 7 (value 87)
- **Agent 1**: Item 0 (value 93)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (value 83)
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (value 90)
- **Agent 4**: Item 2 (value 91)

Now, let's distribute the remaining items considering their next highest values and ensuring all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (value 55)
- **Agent 1**: Item 8 (value 56)
- **Agent 2**: Item 6 (value 67)
- **Agent 3**: Item 5 (value 8)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints of the problem.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [2]
}
```
