Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  92  22   1  54  97  28  74  18
1  96  11  60  64  67  32  31  55  86
2  13  48   5  20  11  87  94  17  98
3  49  91  18  58  10   6  10  30   8
4   7  48  50  91  80  76  14  57  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. Our goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuation, and no one envies another agent's allocation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [79, 92, 22, 1, 54, 97, 28, 74, 18]
Agent 1: [96, 11, 60, 64, 67, 32, 31, 55, 86]
Agent 2: [13, 48, 5, 20, 11, 87, 94, 17, 98]
Agent 3: [49, 91, 18, 58, 10, 6, 10, 30, 8]
Agent 4: [7, 48, 50, 91, 80, 76, 14, 57, 62]
```

We aim to distribute the items to maximize total satisfaction and minimize envy. One straightforward approach is to start by allocating each agent their most valued item, then continue by allocating remaining items based on descending order of value for the agents who have received fewer items.

Here's a fair allocation considering these valuations:

- **Agent 0** values item 5 the highest at 97.
- **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest at 96.
- **Agent 2** values item 8 the highest at 98.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest at 91.
- **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest at 91.

Once the highest valued items are allocated, we proceed to allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 also values item 1 at 92.
- Agent 1 also values item 4 at 67 and item 7 at 55.
- Agent 2 also values item 6 at 94.
- Agent 3 has received item 1 and usually has lower valuations.
- Agent 4 values item 4 at 80, but it is already allocated. So, we allocate item 2 valued at 50.

Based on these considerations, a possible fair allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 4, 7],
    "2": [8, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives a set of items considering their valuation priorities. Agent 3 does not receive any items as their valuation for the highest unallocated items is lower compared to others' valuations. This allocation aims to balance the perceived fairness and reduce envy among the agents.
