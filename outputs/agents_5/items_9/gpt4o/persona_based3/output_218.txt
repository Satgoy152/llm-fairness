Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  91  22  45  14  62  74  19  35
1  54  81  13  80  65  49  11  65  72
2  82  87  94  28  82   5  22  44   0
3  47  92  84   6   5  33  68  99  95
4  70  37  38  47  23  22  88  42  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have a fair share, which often means maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive while minimizing envy.

Let's start by examining some possible allocation strategies:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: Each agent might have particular items they value highly, which could be prioritized for their allocation.
2. **Distribution Based on Valuations**: We can consider allocating items to agents such that the sum of valuations is balanced across agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 (91) and item 5 (62) highly.
- **Agent 1** values item 3 (80) and item 4 (65) highly.
- **Agent 2** values item 2 (94) and item 0 (82) highly.
- **Agent 3** values item 7 (99) and item 8 (95) highly.
- **Agent 4** values item 6 (88) highly.

Based on these preferences, one possible fair allocation of items to agents could be:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 0]
- Agent 3: Items [7, 8]
- Agent 4: Item [6]

Let's ensure all items are allocated and that each agent receives a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5] (91+62 = 153)
- Agent 1: Items [3, 4] (80+65 = 145)
- Agent 2: Items [2, 0] (94+82 = 176)
- Agent 3: Items [7, 8] (99+95 = 194)
- Agent 4: Item [6] (88)

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 9 items and ensures each agent has at least one item.
