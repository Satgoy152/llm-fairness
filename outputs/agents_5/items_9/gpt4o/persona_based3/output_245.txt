Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  84  73  80  73  97  35  37  24
1  42  99   0  95  47  16  72  12  56
2  95  48  47  82  69  76  79  12  22
3  58  56  96  35  89  89  98  88  39
4  93  56  15  86  70  46  55  29  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that attempts to respect the valuations and minimize envy. A common approach is to use an algorithm like the "round-robin" or "maximum marginal return" method. Here, we'll use a straightforward approach to ensure that every agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Given the constraints, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. Let's perform a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing each agent's utility:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (97), so we will allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (99), so we will allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (95), so we will allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6 (98), so we will allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0, but since it's already allocated, we check the next highest which is item 3 (86), and allocate it to Agent 4.
6. Agent 0's next highest is item 3, but it's taken. So we allocate item 4 (73) to Agent 0.
7. Agent 1's next highest is item 3, but it's taken. So we allocate item 4 (47) to Agent 1.
8. Agent 2's next highest is item 6, but it's taken. So we allocate item 2 (47) to Agent 2.
9. Agent 3's next highest is item 4, but it's taken. So we allocate item 7 (88) to Agent 3.
10. Agent 4's next highest is item 4, but it's taken. So we allocate item 8 (67) to Agent 4.

Now, let's check if all items have been fairly allocated:

- Items Allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Total Allocated: 9 items

The final allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving preference based on their highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
