Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  28  57  66  93  44  38  42  19
1  20  23  42  42  50  39  70   9  45
2  36  18  24  29  57  22  89  63  20
3  60  22  15   7  44  76  95  32  17
4  19  75  92   5  17  53  29  87  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that envy-freeness is achieved, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. We will attempt to balance the total value each agent receives according to their preferences. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify High-Value Items for Each Agent**: We first look for items that are highly valued by individual agents compared to others.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items**: Assign these high-value items to the respective agents.

3. **Balance Remaining Items**: Distribute the remaining items to achieve a balanced allocation, ensuring each agent has a comparable total valuation.

Let's go through the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 4 (93) and 3 (66). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Item 6 is highly valued (70). Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 6 (already allocated), but item 7 has a high value (63). Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 6 (already allocated), but item 5 has a high value (76). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 1 (75). Assign item 1 to Agent 4.

Now allocate the remaining items:

- **Item 0**: Assign to Agent 0 for a total value of 155.
- **Item 2**: Assign to Agent 4 (total value now 167).
- **Item 3**: Assign to Agent 1. 
- **Item 8**: Assign to Agent 3. 

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5, 8],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, aiming to minimize envy among them.
