Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  56  32   0  61  17  45  62  20
1   0  74   2  57  88  72  97   3   1
2  86  10  76  42  69  45  66  51  25
3  82  57  66  45   4  93  10  24  94
4  93  56  23  19  12  40  84   9  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the minimum satisfaction among all agents. This is often referred to as a max-min fairness approach. We will attempt to distribute the items so that each agent gets a "fair" share based on their preferences, and we will ensure envy-freeness as much as possible given the constraints.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 0. We allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 6. We allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2. We allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 5. We allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** highly values item 8. We allocate item 8 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 1, 3, 4, and 7:

- **Agent 1** also highly values item 4. We allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 0** values item 1 significantly. We allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 3** values item 3 more than others. We allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 2** can be allocated item 7, which they value reasonably.

This allocation attempts to balance the agents' highest preferences while ensuring each agent receives some items.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [8]
}
``` 

This allocation aims to respect the preferences of the agents as much as possible given the constraints. Each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
