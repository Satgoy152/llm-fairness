Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  76  52  84  51  67  42  78  57
1  52  32   2  35  89  46  54  78  17
2  88  56  27   6  58  77  39  13  13
3  92  88   9   6  36  68   9  90  13
4   7  10  32  96  91  23   6  45  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim to consider the concept of envy-freeness. This means each agent should be at least as happy with their own allocation as they would be with any other agent's allocation. To do this, we'll evaluate the given valuations and try to allocate items in a manner that minimizes envy. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and only 9 items are available, we need to ensure that each agent's allocation maximizes their value while considering the overall fairness.

Let's approach this by evaluating the potential allocations:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (84).
   - Agent 1 values item 4 the highest (89).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (88).
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (92).
   - Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (96).

2. **Allocate based on unique high-value items**:
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4 (highest unique value: 96).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3 (highest unique value: 92).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (highest unique value: 89).

3. **Allocate remaining items to avoid envy**:
   - Allocate item 1 and 7 to Agent 0 (values: 76, 78).
   - Allocate item 2 and 6 to Agent 2 (values: 27, 39).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 (value: 46).
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 4 (value: 77).

Let's verify that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 9. Now, we can format this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 8]
}
```
