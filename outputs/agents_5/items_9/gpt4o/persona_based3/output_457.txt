Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  59  80  91  21   6  47  89  99
1  96  10  61  55   1  33  96  49  77
2  63  79   8  72  39  54  52  93  97
3   9  98  19  40  87  19  77  90  55
4  52  37  77  95  69  34  15  36  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use strategies such as the "maximum envy-free" allocation or other fair division principles. The goal is to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation based on their valuations of the items.

Let's look at the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that respects these principles. We aim for each agent to perceive their allocation as at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation, from their own perspective.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations first, ensuring a fair distribution of value.
2. Consider the total value each agent receives and try to make these as balanced as possible.

Given the valuations, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 8] (total value: 91 + 99 = 190)
- Agent 1: Items [0, 6] (total value: 96 + 96 = 192)
- Agent 2: Items [7] (total value: 93)
- Agent 3: Items [1, 4] (total value: 98 + 87 = 185)
- Agent 4: Items [2, 5] (total value: 77 + 34 = 111)

This allocation tries to balance the total perceived value for each agent as much as possible based on the given valuations.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent gets an integer number of items, and exactly nine items are allocated in total.
