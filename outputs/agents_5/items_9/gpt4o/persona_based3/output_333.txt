Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  63  31  24  95  25  22  76  85
1  20  23  70  72  48   3   0  65  78
2  72  62  44  58  61  11  31  14  29
3  85   0  77  28  66  98  50  99  28
4   2  17  46  17  73  44   7  55  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To address this problem, we aim for an allocation that is as fair as possible given the agents' valuations. We will use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, also known as the maximin strategy, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. This does not guarantee envy-freeness, but it provides a reasonable approach given the constraints.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a high valuation for items 4 and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: Values items 2 and 3 the most.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 0.
4. **Agent 3**: Values items 5, 7, and 0 the most.
5. **Agent 4**: Has reasonably high values across items, but not exceptionally high.

An allocation that attempts to balance these preferences could be as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 8] - Total value: 180
- Agent 1: Items [2, 3] - Total value: 142
- Agent 2: Items [0, 6] - Total value: 103
- Agent 3: Items [5, 7] - Total value: 197
- Agent 4: Item [1] - Total value: 17

In this allocation, each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. The allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [1]
}
```
