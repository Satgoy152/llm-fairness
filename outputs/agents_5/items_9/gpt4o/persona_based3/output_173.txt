Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  43  57  39  13  71  45  78   0
1  43  99  85  70  14  45  59  40  89
2  77  64   6  19  22  96  97  64   0
3  98  17  39  47  14  22  62   7  38
4  25   6  17   6  98  59  55  99  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use an algorithm like the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) solution, which maximizes the product of utilities and often leads to envy-free allocations. Given the valuations provided, here's a step-by-step analysis and allocation:

1. **Calculate the total value each agent has for all items**:
   - Agent 0: 35 + 43 + 57 + 39 + 13 + 71 + 45 + 78 + 0 = 381
   - Agent 1: 43 + 99 + 85 + 70 + 14 + 45 + 59 + 40 + 89 = 544
   - Agent 2: 77 + 64 + 6 + 19 + 22 + 96 + 97 + 64 + 0 = 445
   - Agent 3: 98 + 17 + 39 + 47 + 14 + 22 + 62 + 7 + 38 = 344
   - Agent 4: 25 + 6 + 17 + 6 + 98 + 59 + 55 + 99 + 93 = 358

2. **Allocate items to maximize fairness**:
   - Assign items to agents by prioritizing items that give the highest utility to each agent, ensuring no agent ends up with zero utility if possible.

3. **Proposed Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 2]
   - Agent 1: Items [1, 3]
   - Agent 2: Items [5, 6]
   - Agent 3: Items [7]
   - Agent 4: Items [4, 8]

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution aims to balance the perceived value based on their preferences. 

Below is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4, 8]
}
```
