Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  25  58  59  29  22  91  81  60
1   0  29  73  93  57  39  97  20  21
2  11  83   2  41  37  90  75  25  51
3  18  94  33  49  88  17  33  82  51
4  28  14  66   6  29  42   2  52  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider an approach that attempts to achieve envy-freeness or as close to it as possible given the constraints. One common method is to use the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" process, where agents take turns selecting items in order of their preference until all items are allocated.

However, since we want to find a fair division that respects the given valuations, we can use a heuristic approach that considers the valuations directly. We will aim to maximize each agent's perceived value of their allocation while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest values: 6 (91), 7 (81)
   - Allocated items: 6, 7

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: 6 (97), 3 (93)
   - Allocated items: 3

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: 5 (90), 6 (75)
   - Allocated items: 5, 8

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest values: 1 (94), 4 (88)
   - Allocated items: 1, 4

5. Agent 4:
   - Highest values: 8 (75), 2 (66)
   - Allocated items: 0, 2

This allocation attempts to give each agent items that they value highly while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents, with each agent receiving items based on their highest valuations wherever possible.
