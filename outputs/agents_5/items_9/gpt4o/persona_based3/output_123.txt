Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  30  11  47  21  35  40  64  31
1  36  62  31  74  37  27   2  60  69
2  82  81  59  49  47  57  91  23  38
3   4  30  23  71  86  24  45  57  11
4  73   8  64  43  85  29  14  46   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that each allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items. Envy-freeness means that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own, based on their individual valuations.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (96), Item 7 (64)
   - Allocate: [0, 7]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (74), Item 8 (69)
   - Allocate: [3, 8]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (91), Item 5 (57)
   - Allocate: [5, 6]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (86), Item 3 (71)
   - Allocate: [4] (Item 3 is already taken by Agent 1)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (85), Item 2 (64)
   - Allocate: [1, 2] (Item 4 is already taken by Agent 3)

Let's verify the allocation to ensure that only and exactly 9 items are allocated. 

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a reasonable portion of their highest valued items, striving for envy-freeness given the integer allocation constraint.
