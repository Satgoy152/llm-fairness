Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  95  52  91  82  87  86  51  85
1  69  10  16  69  98  33   3  64  15
2  18  94   3  65  64  32  66  52  36
3  26  17  44  61   4  12  41   3  81
4  72  60  40  18  92  87  64  64  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that the allocation is envy-free and each agent gets an integer number of items, we will use the concept of maximizing the minimum satisfaction. In this context, satisfaction is considered to be an agent's total valuation of the items they receive. We aim to distribute the items so that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation.

Let's follow a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: For each agent, sum up their valuations for all items. This helps to understand their overall preferences.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent one by one, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item initially. This increases the chance of a fair initial distribution.

3. **Refinement**: Adjust allocations to further balance the valuations each agent receives, aiming to equalize the satisfaction levels as closely as possible.

Let's execute this plan:

### Step 1: Total Valuations
- Agent 0: 11 + 95 + 52 + 91 + 82 + 87 + 86 + 51 + 85 = 640
- Agent 1: 69 + 10 + 16 + 69 + 98 + 33 + 3 + 64 + 15 = 377
- Agent 2: 18 + 94 + 3 + 65 + 64 + 32 + 66 + 52 + 36 = 430
- Agent 3: 26 + 17 + 44 + 61 + 4 + 12 + 41 + 3 + 81 = 289
- Agent 4: 72 + 60 + 40 + 18 + 92 + 87 + 64 + 64 + 88 = 585

### Step 2: Initial Greedy Allocation
- Agent 0 should get the item with the highest value to them: Item 1 (95)
- Agent 1 should get the item with the highest value to them: Item 4 (98)
- Agent 2 should get the item with the highest value to them: Item 1 (94)
- Agent 3 should get the item with the highest value to them: Item 8 (81)
- Agent 4 should get the item with the highest value to them: Item 4 (92)

### Step 3: Refinement
The greedy allocation results in conflicts for items 1 and 4. Let's resolve these by considering alternative high-value items for each agent and reallocating:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocated Item 1 (95)
2. **Agent 1**: Allocated Item 4 (98)
3. **Agent 2**: Allocate Item 7 (52)
4. **Agent 3**: Allocated Item 8 (81)
5. **Agent 4**: Allocated Item 5 (87)

Now let's distribute the remaining items to balance the total valuations:

1. **Remaining Items**: 0, 2, 3, 6
2. **Agent 0**: Already has item 1. Add item 0 (11)
3. **Agent 2**: Already has item 7. Add item 6 (66)
4. **Agent 4**: Already has item 5. Add item 2 (40)
5. **Agent 3**: Already has item 8. Add item 3 (61)

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [8, 3],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets a fair share of their high-valued items, and the distribution seeks to minimize envy while ensuring all items are allocated.
