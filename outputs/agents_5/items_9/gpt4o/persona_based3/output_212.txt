Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  27  68  94  53  22  67  70  29
1  87  49  70  58  89  77  62  40  41
2  50  31  43   5  99  90  50  91   4
3  74  13  77  90  96   8  11  48  35
4  47  23  35  61  85  25  53  87  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and maintaining integer allocations, we can use a method called the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method. This involves iterating over the agents in a predetermined order and allowing each agent to choose their most preferred available item. This process is repeated until all items are allocated.

Given the agent-item valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** chooses item 3 (value 94).
2. **Agent 1** chooses item 4 (value 89).
3. **Agent 2** chooses item 7 (value 91).
4. **Agent 3** chooses item 4 (but it's taken, so chooses item 3 next, but it's also taken, so chooses item 0 (value 74)).
5. **Agent 4** chooses item 7 (but it's taken, so chooses item 4 next, but it's also taken, so chooses item 3 next, but it's also taken, so chooses item 0 next, but it's also taken, so chooses item 6 (value 53)).

Now the second round:

6. **Agent 0** chooses item 2 (value 68).
7. **Agent 1** chooses item 5 (value 77).
8. **Agent 2** chooses item 6 (but it's taken, so chooses item 4 next, but it's also taken, so chooses item 7 next, but it's also taken, so chooses item 5 next, but it's also taken, so chooses item 0 next, but it's also taken, so chooses item 1 (value 31)).
9. **Agent 3** chooses item 8 (value 35).

All items have now been allocated. The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [7, 1],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation process seeks to ensure that each agent receives items based on their highest available preference in a fair manner.
