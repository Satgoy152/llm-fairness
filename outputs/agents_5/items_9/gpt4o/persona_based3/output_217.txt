Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  45   8  29  38  33  73   9  76
1  96   3  44  24  59  29   4  73  60
2  36  41  64  93  57  74  95  35   2
3   2  48  35  25   4  60  20  52  24
4  97  10  66  89  91  75  43  58  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we aim to achieve a distribution that minimizes envy among agents, ensuring that each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the valuations provided, we will employ a heuristic approach to achieve a fair division.

Let's start by allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 8 (value 76), then item 0 (value 74).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 0 (value 96), then item 7 (value 73).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 6 (value 95), then item 3 (value 93).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 5 (value 60), then item 7 (value 52).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 0 (value 97), then item 3 (value 89).

To avoid conflicts where multiple agents prefer the same item, we will attempt to optimize the overall allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 8 and 6 (values 76 and 73).
- Agent 1 gets item 0 (value 96).
- Agent 2 gets item 3 (value 93).
- Agent 3 gets item 5 (value 60).
- Agent 4 gets items 4 and 2 (values 91 and 66).

Now, we have assigned 7 items. We need to allocate 2 more items:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 1, who values it at 73, considering they already have a high value item, ensuring their envy is minimized.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3, who values it at 48, balancing their allocation.

This allocation distributes the items fairly, taking into account each agent's highest preferences while minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, and the total number of allocated items is 9, meeting the requirements.
