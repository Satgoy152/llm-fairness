Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  87  11  13  77  67  37  98   0
1  37  64  74  76  91  36  14   2  21
2  97  51  52  56  28  97  65  76  38
3  72   0  74  68  50  45  84  34  83
4  10  89  18   8  51  89  67   4  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which aims to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. One approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" where agents take turns picking their most preferred available item. Since we want an integer allocation of items, each agent should end up with either one or two items (since there are more items than agents).

Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Initialization**: List all items and their valuations for each agent.
2. **Round 1**: Each agent picks their most valued item that is still available.
3. **Round 2**: Continue the picking process in the same order or reverse order until all items are allocated.

Here are the steps in detail:

- **Agent 0**: Most valued available item is 7 (value 98).
- **Agent 1**: Most valued available item is 4 (value 91).
- **Agent 2**: Most valued available item is 0 (value 97).
- **Agent 3**: Most valued available item is 2 (value 74).
- **Agent 4**: Most valued available item is 1 (value 89).

After the first round, the allocated items are:  
- Agent 0: [7]  
- Agent 1: [4]  
- Agent 2: [0]  
- Agent 3: [2]  
- Agent 4: [1]  

Remaining items: 3, 5, 6, 8

- **Agent 0**: Next most valued available item is 5 (value 67).
- **Agent 1**: Next most valued available item is 3 (value 76).
- **Agent 2**: Next most valued available item is 6 (value 65).
- **Agent 3**: Next most valued available item is 8 (value 83).

After the second round, the allocations are:  
- Agent 0: [7, 5]  
- Agent 1: [4, 3]  
- Agent 2: [0, 6]  
- Agent 3: [2, 8]  
- Agent 4: [1]

Now let's format the result in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and no more than two, and we have allocated all 9 items.
