Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  91  50  49  40  87  89  56   3
1  64   0   8  53   3  91   5  92  10
2   6  85  95  19   7   9  86  67  21
3  28  76  88  20  21  49  94  99  14
4  37  36  32   6  70  21  48  71  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, our goal is to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to others.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values items 0, 1, 5, and 6 highly.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 and 7 highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 highly.
4. **Agent 3** values items 7 highly.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 highly.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 since it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0 as it is also highly valued by them.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3, who values it highly.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 3 as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as it is their highest valued item.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 4, as it is their second highest valued item.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as they have a relatively higher valuation for this item compared to others.

This allocation is designed to ensure that each agent receives items based on their preferences, while trying to maintain envy-freeness.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents.
