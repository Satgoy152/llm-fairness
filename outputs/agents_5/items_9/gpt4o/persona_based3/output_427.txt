Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48   2  88  47  70   8  95  40  92
1  68  86   9  75  51  77   3  17  41
2   6  89  68  20  73  14  53  55  69
3  86  45   4  48  65   7   5  45  14
4  32  11  37  42  26  37  96  11  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum value each agent receives, which is a common approach in fair division problems. This method helps ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their own valuations. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Identify the highest value item for each agent**: Start by giving each agent their highest-valued item if possible, ensuring no item is allocated twice.

2. **Allocate remaining items**: Distribute any remaining items by considering which agent values them the most, while keeping track of ensuring that each agentâ€™s allocation is as balanced as possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 6 the most (95), allocate item 6.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the most (86), allocate item 1.
- **Agent 2**: Values item 1 the most, but it is already taken, so allocate the next highest valued item 4 (73).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 0 the most (86), allocate item 0.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 6 the most, but it is already taken, so allocate the next highest valued item 8 (71).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0 (valued at 88, highest remaining for Agent 0).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (valued at 75, highest remaining for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2 (valued at 14, highest remaining for Agent 2).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 (valued at 45, highest remaining for Agent 3).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and the allocation is as fair as possible given the constraints.
