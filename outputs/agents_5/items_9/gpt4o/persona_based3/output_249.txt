Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78   2  11  40  35  34  55  31  53
1  66  70  76  80  50  21  18   8  19
2  19  44  47  35  61  69  82  53  18
3  78  68  79  26   2  28  10  66  26
4  65  43   8  89  59  96  62  21  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while attempting to maintain envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of the items by each agent and attempt to distribute them so that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Given that there are 5 agents and 9 items, each agent will receive either 1 or 2 items. 

Let's start by evaluating the items and distributing them based on the highest value for each agent and then balancing to ensure each agent gets a fair allocation.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation by Highest Valuation:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 at 78, which is the highest valuation for item 0. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Agent 1 values item 3 at 80, which is the highest valuation for item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Agent 2 values item 6 at 82, which is the highest valuation for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 2 at 79, which is the highest valuation for item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
   - Agent 4 values item 5 at 96, which is the highest valuation for item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

2. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 4, 7, 8.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 1, who values it at 70, second highest valuation.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 2, who values it at 61.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 3, who values it at 66.
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 4, who values it at 67.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [5, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, with each agent receiving their most valued or second most valued items wherever possible, while ensuring all items are allocated.
