Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  37  14  26  28  41  32  94  20
1  66  73  25  70  41  85  15  68  42
2  44   0  22  79  73  23  93  40  51
3  19  80   5  81  39  73  66  33  14
4  22  92  77  96  57  81  55  37  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents ensuring envy-freeness, we can employ the method of maximizing the minimum utility each agent derives from their allocation. This involves ensuring that no agent feels another agent has been treated more favorably according to their own valuations. 

Given the table of valuations, let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each agent values items differently, so we need to assign items to agents where they derive the most value while considering the overall fairness.
   - There are 5 agents and 9 items, so some agents will receive more items than others.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest individual valuations.
   - Ensure that each agentâ€™s allocation is as balanced as possible in terms of total value to mitigate envy.

3. **Fair Division**:
   - Use a greedy algorithm to allocate items one by one, selecting the agent who values the item the most but hasn't yet received an item that significantly boosts their total valuation above others.
   - Adjust allocations if necessary to balance the overall value distribution among agents.

Here is a possible fair allocation of the items:

- Agent 0: Items [7] (Value: 94)
- Agent 1: Items [5] (Value: 85)
- Agent 2: Items [6, 3] (Values: 93, 79)
- Agent 3: Items [1, 0] (Values: 80, 19)
- Agent 4: Items [4, 2, 8] (Values: 57, 77, 87)

This allocation gives a relatively balanced distribution of total values among agents, considering their individual valuations for the items.

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [1, 0],
    "4": [4, 2, 8]
}
```
