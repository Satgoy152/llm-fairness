Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  64   0  67  75  65   4  25   6
1  45  28   3  38   5  40  68  63   3
2  95  82  42  18  32  28  40  18   6
3  50  65  15  91  15  86  57   4   8
4  19  74  15  63  34  73  16  17  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve an envy-free allocation of the 9 items among the 5 agents, we can employ the Maximum Weighted Matching approach. This approach involves assigning items to agents in a way that maximizes the total valuation while also ensuring that each agent does not envy another agent's allocation.

We have the following valuations matrix:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Item 6 | Item 7 | Item 8 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 39     | 64     | 0      | 67     | 75     | 65     | 4      | 25     | 6      |
| 1     | 45     | 28     | 3      | 38     | 5      | 40     | 68     | 63     | 3      |
| 2     | 95     | 82     | 42     | 18     | 32     | 28     | 40     | 18     | 6      |
| 3     | 50     | 65     | 15     | 91     | 15     | 86     | 57     | 4      | 8      |
| 4     | 19     | 74     | 15     | 63     | 34     | 73     | 16     | 17     | 89     |

To allocate the items fairly while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, we can try to balance the allocations based on their valuations. After analyzing the table and considering possible allocations, here is a fair distribution of items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4
- Agent 1: Items 6, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 2
- Agent 3: Items 3, 5
- Agent 4: Item 8

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [8]
}
```
