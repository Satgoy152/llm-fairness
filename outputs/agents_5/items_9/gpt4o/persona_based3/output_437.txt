Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  87  47  53  80  20  67  54  58
1  12  49  31  37  14  31  93  83  49
2  51   1  23  63  37  83  36  92  25
3  71  43  60   7  89  79  72  29  20
4  44  87  71   9  77  72  78  39  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a simple greedy algorithm. This approach is not guaranteed to be perfectly envy-free, but it attempts to minimize envy by allocating items based on the highest valuation.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. List all items and their valuations for each agent.
2. Sort the items in descending order of valuation for each agent.
3. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that the total number of items allocated equals 9.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (71), so allocate to Agent 3.
- Item 1: Agent 0 and 4 both value it the most (87), so allocate to Agent 0 (arbitrarily choosing between ties).
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most (71), so allocate to Agent 4.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most (63), so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (89), so allocate to Agent 3.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (83), so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it the most (93), so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (92), so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it the most (58), so allocate to Agent 0.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 5, 7],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item while attempting to minimize envy by allocating items based on highest valuation.
