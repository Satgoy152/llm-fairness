Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  42  83  19  14  43  24  31  90
1  50  27  37  48  23  97   4  98  94
2  91  11  26   7  41  22   0  27  10
3  66  26  62  36   1  54  96  95  86
4  68  12  59  52  48  27  62   4  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should consider each agent's valuation for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their own valuations.

A common approach is to use an algorithm that considers the agents' preferences and allocates items iteratively, ensuring that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. In this context, we can utilize a modified version of the "round-robin" method or similar techniques to achieve a reasonable allocation.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations and distributing the items:

1. Identify items with the highest unique valuations for each agent and allocate them.
2. Allocate remaining items in a way to balance the total perceived value for each agent.

Here's the allocation process:

- **Item 8** is highly valued by agent 0 (90).
- **Item 6** is highly valued by agent 3 (96).
- **Item 5** is highly valued by agent 1 (97).
- **Item 0** is highly valued by agent 2 (91).
- **Item 7** is highly valued by agent 1 (98).

After these allocations, we distribute the remaining items to balance the valuations:

- **Item 1** is given to agent 0 (42).
- **Item 3** is given to agent 4 (52).
- **Item 4** is given to agent 4 (48).
- **Item 2** is given to agent 3 (62).

After considering the above steps, the allocation can be summarized as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure each agent receives items that have high relative value to them, minimizing potential envy and aiming to balance the total perceived value across all agents.
