Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  69  46  19  10  35   9  48   0
1  47  81  89  91   5  47  48  38  21
2  30   8  66  34  61  77  12  93  61
3  86  22  92  30  59  92  72  42  69
4   0  67  89  96  75  24  45  89  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items in such a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. One approach to achieve this is to use a method like the "Adjusted Winner" procedure or a simple greedy algorithm based on maximizing individual valuations while ensuring a fair distribution.

Given the valuations table, we can use a greedy algorithm to allocate the items. Here's one way to do it:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.
3. If there are conflicts (multiple agents value an item equally), try to resolve them by considering the overall distribution of items.

Following this process, we can derive an allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most (86).
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (81).
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most (92).
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most (96).
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most (75).
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most (92).
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most (72).
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (93).
- Item 8: Agent 3 values it the most (69).

However, this allocation gives agent 3 too many items. We need to redistribute items to ensure fairness. Let's adjust this distribution:

- Item 0: Agent 3
- Item 1: Agent 1
- Item 2: Agent 4
- Item 3: Agent 4
- Item 4: Agent 2
- Item 5: Agent 2
- Item 6: Agent 3
- Item 7: Agent 4
- Item 8: Agent 0

This ensures that all items are allocated fairly. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [2, 3, 7]
}
```
