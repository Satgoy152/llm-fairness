Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  71  86  88   0  48  17   2  29
1  74  34  51  23  18  48  24   3  94
2  95  26  14  82  82   7  89   6   1
3  34  47  77  81  46  32   5  44  53
4  65  63  61  70  84  85  66  86   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use an algorithm that aims to minimize envy and ensure each agent receives an equitable share of the items based on their valuations. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 34 + 71 + 86 + 88 + 0 + 48 + 17 + 2 + 29 = 375
   - Agent 1: 74 + 34 + 51 + 23 + 18 + 48 + 24 + 3 + 94 = 369
   - Agent 2: 95 + 26 + 14 + 82 + 82 + 7 + 89 + 6 + 1 = 402
   - Agent 3: 34 + 47 + 77 + 81 + 46 + 32 + 5 + 44 + 53 = 419
   - Agent 4: 65 + 63 + 61 + 70 + 84 + 85 + 66 + 86 + 1 = 581

2. **Allocate Items Based on Maximum Valuation:**
   - Assign items to agents based on who values them the most.

3. **Iterate to Balance Allocations:**
   - Ensure that no agent has more items than others unless it maximizes fairness and envy-freeness.

**Proposed Allocation:**

- Agent 0 receives items: 3, 0 (88, 34)
- Agent 1 receives items: 8, 1 (94, 34)
- Agent 2 receives items: 4, 6 (82, 89)
- Agent 3 receives items: 2, 5 (77, 32)
- Agent 4 receives items: 7 (86)

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items each agent receives while considering their preferences.

**JSON Representation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [8, 1],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [7]
}
```

Each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. This allocation aims to minimize envy and achieve a fair distribution based on the provided valuations.
