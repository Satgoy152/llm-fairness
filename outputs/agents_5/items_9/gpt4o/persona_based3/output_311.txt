Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  45  56  65  80  81   3   2  26
1  19  14   0   7  21  42  80  15  74
2   2  35  86  88  64  56  66  31  55
3  77  58  34  23  93  49  60  36  78
4   6  64  12  70  60  13  87  88  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while trying to achieve envy-freeness, we can use various methods such as the maximin share approach or approximate allocations based on preferences. Given the valuations, let's try to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4 and item 5.
- Agent 1 highly values item 6 and item 8.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2 and item 3.
- Agent 3 highly values item 4 and item 8.
- Agent 4 highly values item 7 and item 6.

Considering these preferences, we aim to allocate items to each agent such that they receive items they value highly while ensuring that no agent envies another too much.

### Allocation:

- Agent 0: [4, 5]
- Agent 1: [6, 8]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]
- Agent 3: [0, 1]
- Agent 4: [7]

Let's double-check that all items are allocated:

- Total items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (9 items)

All items are allocated appropriately, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items based on the agents' preferences and ensures that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.
