Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  15  21  87  13  65   8  49  24
1  72  30  32  44  63  74  74  95  64
2  94   0   5  92  17  63  89  13  69
3  34   8  63  32  31  72  56  46  22
4  16  98  13  34  35  11  54  63  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own, given their own valuation of the items. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High valuations for item 0 (95) and item 3 (87). 
   - Assign items 0 and 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation for item 7 (95), and high valuation for item 5 (74).
   - Assign items 5 and 7 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation for item 6 (89) and item 2 (5).
   - Assign items 6 and 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation for item 2 (63) but already assigned. Next highest are 5 (72) and 0 (34), both assigned.
   - Assign item 8 (22) and item 4 (31) to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuation for item 1 (98).
   - Assign item 1 to agent 4.

Let's ensure all items are assigned and the allocation is complete:

- Items: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 are all assigned.
- Total items allocated: 9.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [8, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the highest individual valuations and ensures each agent receives an item set that maximizes their personal valuation, reducing potential envy among agents.
