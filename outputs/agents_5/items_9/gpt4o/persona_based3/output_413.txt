Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  30  15  89  36  44  16  97  47
1   8  62  21  76  47  51  37   8  66
2  56  38  32  52  20  92  77  55  68
3  58  83  28  34  21  38  90   3  42
4  66  99  85  23  94   7  77  34  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their own valuations. 

One common approach is to use the "Round Robin" method, where each agent takes turns selecting the most valued item that is still available. This method is simple and can lead to an envy-free allocation if the agents have different preferences.

Let's execute this method for the given problem:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 7 (value 97).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 1 (value 62).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 5 (value 92).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 6 (value 90).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 1 (value 99), but it's already taken, so next is 4 (value 94).

Now, continue the round-robin:

6. **Agent 0**: Next highest value item is 3 (value 89).
7. **Agent 1**: Next highest value item is 8 (value 66).
8. **Agent 2**: Next highest value item is 8 (value 68), but it's taken, so next is 2 (value 32).
9. **Agent 3**: Next highest value item is 0 (value 58).
10. **Agent 4**: Next highest value item is 8 (value 83), but it's taken, so next is 2 (value 85), but it's taken, so next is 0 (value 66), but it's taken, so next is 6 (value 77).

Finally, we can allocate the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** has 7, 3.
- **Agent 1** has 1, 8.
- **Agent 2** has 5, 2.
- **Agent 3** has 6, 0.
- **Agent 4** has 4.

Therefore, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [6, 0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
