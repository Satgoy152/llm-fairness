Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  20  14  29  64  26  39  70  34
1  21  25  88   6  41  25  18  31  86
2  17  53  77  51  45  68  80  51  20
3  73  43  35   6  34  69  24  16  73
4  77   5  10  92  40  75  25  12  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is as balanced as possible based on their valuations. One approach is to use the "envy-free" allocation principle, which means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent to their own, based on their valuations. However, achieving absolute envy-freeness with integer item allocations can be quite challenging. Instead, we'll aim for a reasonably fair distribution.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 seems to value item 7 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 2 and item 8 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 0 and item 8 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 3 highly.

We'll try to distribute the high-value items to each agent based on their preferences while ensuring everyone gets at least one item.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 7
- Agent 1: Items 2, 8
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Items 0, 5
- Agent 4: Items 1, 3, 4

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and the distribution considers their high-value preferences.

{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
