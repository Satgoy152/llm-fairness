Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  86  78  19  74   3   3  47  31
1  63  33  45  35  67  37  43  76  15
2  69   5  49  41   6  79  37  67  43
3  43   5  44  93   6  99  41  31  27
4  10  21  50  64  65  50  95  60  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents in a fair manner, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agentâ€™s allocation, given their own valuation.

One way to approach this problem is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns, and iteratively assign items while considering fairness and balance across agents.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values items [0, 1] the most (86 each), then item [2] (78).
2. **Agent 1** values item [7] the most (76), then item [4] (67).
3. **Agent 2** values item [5] the most (79), then items [7] and [8] (67 and 43).
4. **Agent 3** values item [5] the most (99), then item [3] (93).
5. **Agent 4** values item [6] the most (95), then items [3] and [4] (64 and 65).

Given the above valuations, we can try allocating items to maximize each agent's satisfaction and balance out the items.

### Initial Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: [0, 1] (most valued, both 86)
- **Agent 1**: [7] (most valued, 76)
- **Agent 2**: [5] (most valued, 79)
- **Agent 3**: [3] (highly valued, 93)
- **Agent 4**: [6] (most valued, 95)

Now, we have allocated 6 items, and each agent has at least one of their top choices. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items [2, 4, 8] while maintaining fairness.

### Additional Allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Already has 2 items.
- **Agent 1**: Add item [4] (second-highest value for them, 67).
- **Agent 2**: Add item [8] (third-highest value for them, 43).
- **Agent 3**: Already has a highly valued item.
- **Agent 4**: Add item [2] (decent value for them, 50).

This results in each agent having their top items and the remaining items are allocated to balance the distribution.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring each agent receives at least one highly valued item.
