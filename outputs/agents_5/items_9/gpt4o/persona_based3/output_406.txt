Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  41  96  91  61  74  53  91  72
1  81  10  86  89  15  47  95  43  51
2  18  44  18   6  90  17  20  89  88
3  18  77  96  64  80  37  92  68  51
4  83  35  29  82  72  72  45  60  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the 5 agents while considering envy-freeness, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their valuations. Here, I'm using a simple heuristic approach to ensure each agent receives items they value highly relative to others.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Rank the Items per Agent:**
   - For each agent, rank the items based on how much value they assign to them.

2. **Assign Items Iteratively:**
   - Start with the highest-ranked item for each agent and check if it can be assigned without creating envy among others.
   - Move to the next highest-ranked item for the agent if the current one is already assigned or creates envy.
   - Continue this process until all items are allocated.

3. **Balance the Allocations:**
   - Ensure each agent receives at least one item (or as evenly as possible) if the number of items allows.

### Allocation:

Let's go through a possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 0 picks:** Item 2 (highest value for them)
2. **Agent 1 picks:** Item 6 (highest value for them)
3. **Agent 2 picks:** Item 4 (highest value for them)
4. **Agent 3 picks:** Item 3 (highest value for them)
5. **Agent 4 picks:** Item 0 (highest value for them)

Next, allocate the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0 picks:** Item 5 (next highest value for them)
7. **Agent 1 picks:** Item 7 (next highest value for them)
8. **Agent 3 picks:** Item 1 (next highest value for them)
9. **Agent 4 picks:** Item 8 (next highest value for them)

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent gets items that they value relatively highly, reducing potential envy.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [0, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value and that all items are distributed.
