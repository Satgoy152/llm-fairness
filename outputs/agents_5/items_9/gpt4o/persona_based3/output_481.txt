Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  40  76  67  43  49  17  92  42
1  20  22  44  54  86  17  48  63  75
2  71  33  41   6  21  45  82  51  76
3  50   1  76  73  85  39  79   8  53
4  72  69  56  14  80  28  66  46  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division and ensure envy-freeness, we need to allocate the items to the agents in a way that maximizes each agent's valuation of their bundle, while ensuring that no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent based on their own valuations. One approach to achieve this is to use the "adjusted winner" procedure or other fair division strategies such as maximizing the Nash welfare (the product of utilities) or the max-min fairness approach.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
0  25  40  76  67  43  49  17  92  42
1  20  22  44  54  86  17  48  63  75
2  71  33  41   6  21  45  82  51  76
3  50   1  76  73  85  39  79   8  53
4  72  69  56  14  80  28  66  46  41
```

Let's allocate the items to ensure fairness and envy-freeness:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuation for item 7 (92) and item 2 (76).
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (86) and item 8 (75) highly.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 (71) and item 6 (82) highly.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 (73) and item 4 (85) highly, but item 4 is already preferred by Agent 1.
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 (72) and item 4 (80) highly, but items 0 and 4 are already preferred by others.

Considering these preferences and ensuring no agent envies another, a potential allocation can be:

- **Agent 0:** [2, 7]
- **Agent 1:** [4, 8]
- **Agent 2:** [0, 6]
- **Agent 3:** [3]
- **Agent 4:** [1, 5]

This allocation attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives while respecting their individual preferences.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
