Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  33  93  53  24  60  94  93  46
1  47  19  47  16  29  51  60  25  88
2  75  69  59   7  90   8   1   5   9
3   4  18  70  86  73  64  44  87  86
4  32  89  85  19  28  49  39  86  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as from any other agent's allocation. Given that there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents may receive more items than others, but the overall allocation should maximize perceived fairness.

Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:**
   - Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items.

2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by assigning items that have a significantly higher valuation for one agent compared to others.
   - Use a round-robin or similar method to allocate remaining items, ensuring that each allocation maximizes perceived value for the receiving agent.

3. **Check and Adjust:**
   - Ensure that the allocation is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible.
   - Adjust any allocations if necessary to reduce envy.

Let's calculate and provide a fair allocation:

### Valuations per Agent:
- **Agent 0:** 76, 33, 93, 53, 24, 60, 94, 93, 46 (total = 572)
- **Agent 1:** 47, 19, 47, 16, 29, 51, 60, 25, 88 (total = 382)
- **Agent 2:** 75, 69, 59, 7, 90, 8, 1, 5, 9 (total = 323)
- **Agent 3:** 4, 18, 70, 86, 73, 64, 44, 87, 86 (total = 532)
- **Agent 4:** 32, 89, 85, 19, 28, 49, 39, 86, 59 (total = 486)

### Allocation Strategy:
- Allocate items with the highest individual valuation for each agent first.
- Distribute remaining items to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

### Item Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Receives item 6 (value 94) and item 2 (value 93).
- **Agent 1:** Receives item 8 (value 88) and item 5 (value 51).
- **Agent 2:** Receives item 4 (value 90).
- **Agent 3:** Receives item 3 (value 86) and item 7 (value 87).
- **Agent 4:** Receives item 1 (value 89) and item 0 (value 32).

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [8, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the total value each agent perceives they receive, while minimizing possible envy by ensuring each agent gets items of high personal value.
