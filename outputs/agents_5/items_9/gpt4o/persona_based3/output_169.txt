Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  84  67  48  67   4  36  96  86
1  29  63  25  66  36  19  35   4  57
2  48  88  85  19  35  81  35  93   5
3  21  61  71   8  71  17   1  64  89
4   5   9  11  44  99  12  10  89  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method like the envy-free allocation that ensures each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. However, since we have more items than agents, and each agent must receive an integer number of items, we'll need to balance the allocations carefully.

One common approach is to start with the agent who has the highest valuation for any unallocated item and assign that item to them, continuing this process while trying to maintain a balance. Given that we have 9 items and 5 agents, each agent should ideally get around 1 to 2 items, with some receiving more if necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0:** Has the highest valuation for item 7 (96). Assign item 7 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 2:** Has the highest remaining valuation for item 1 (88). Assign item 1 to agent 2.
3. **Agent 2:** Also has the highest valuation for item 8 (93). Assign item 8 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 4:** Has the highest valuation for item 4 (99). Assign item 4 to agent 4.
5. **Agent 0:** Has the highest remaining valuation for item 8 (86), but item 8 is already allocated. The next highest is item 0 (78). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
6. **Agent 3:** Has the highest remaining valuation for item 2 (71). Assign item 2 to agent 3.
7. **Agent 1:** Has the highest remaining valuation for item 3 (66). Assign item 3 to agent 1.
8. **Agent 3:** Has the highest remaining valuation for item 8 (89), but item 8 is already allocated. The next highest is item 5 (17). Assign item 5 to agent 3.
9. **Agent 1:** Has the highest remaining valuation for item 6 (35). Assign item 6 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly, considering the constraints.

Finally, here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [4]
}
```
