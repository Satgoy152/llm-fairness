Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39   8  87  96  39  47  72  58  32
1  78  55  79  17  43  35   7  71  92
2  45  56  18  69  86  36   0  48  19
3  46  89  42   2  88  57  58  59  93
4  20  60  91  95  98  49  68  59  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation means that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own.

One common approach is to use the "round-robin" method or "sequential allocation" where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item. This method helps ensure that each agent has a fair chance to acquire high-valued items according to their preferences.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0** selects item 3 (value 96).
2. **Agent 1** selects item 8 (value 92).
3. **Agent 2** selects item 4 (value 86).
4. **Agent 3** selects item 8 (value 93) - already taken by Agent 1, so selects item 4 (value 88) - already taken by Agent 2, selects item 1 (value 89).
5. **Agent 4** selects item 4 (value 98) - already taken, selects item 3 (value 95) - already taken by Agent 0, selects item 2 (value 91).

After one round, we distribute the remaining items. We continue this process until all items are allocated:

- **Agent 0** selects item 2 (value 87).
- **Agent 1** selects item 0 (value 78).
- **Agent 2** selects item 5 (value 36).
- **Agent 3** selects item 8 (value 93).
- **Agent 4** selects item 6 (value 68).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [8, 0],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation tries to balance the preferences of agents given the constraints of integer allocation and the particular valuations provided by each agent.
