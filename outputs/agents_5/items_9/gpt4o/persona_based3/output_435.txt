Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  57  97  87  73  75  57  97  63
1  96  14  73   1   9  44  80  34  25
2  78  59  93  24  96  99  78  84  93
3  86  14  41  33  48  31  68  35  63
4  31  87  40  87  11  12  90  10  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 87 40 87 11 12 90 10 75]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the five agents, we want to consider the concept of envy-freeness, which means that each agent should be at least as happy with their own allocation as they would be with any other agent's allocation. Given that each agent's valuation of items is different, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's use a strategy that involves maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent's allocation. We'll proceed by assigning items iteratively, considering each agent's highest preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values items 2 and 7 the most (97 each), so we will allocate these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1's highest valued item, after 2 and 7 are taken, is 0 (96). We allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
   - Then, the next high-value item for Agent 1 is item 6 (80). Allocate item 6.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - The highest valued item by Agent 2 is 5 (99), which is available. Allocate item 5.
   - Next, item 4 is valued at 96 by Agent 2, allocate item 4.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - The highest available valued item for Agent 3 is 0 and 2, which are taken. The next is item 8 (63). Allocate item 8 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - The highest available valued item for Agent 4 is 1 (87). Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
   - The next highest valued item for Agent 4 is item 3 (87). Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

After this process, all 9 items have been allocated among the agents.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```
