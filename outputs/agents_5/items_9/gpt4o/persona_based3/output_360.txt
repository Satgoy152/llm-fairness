Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  61  84  67  13  62  52  16  17
1  10  68  80  50  60  77  74  23  50
2   9  31  14  43   2  95  74  39  16
3   2  90  60  47  88  71  85  53  33
4  23  73  38  19  51  13  94  30  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, a common approach is to aim for envy-freeness and efficiency, where each agent feels they have received a fair share given their valuations. Since there are 9 items and 5 agents, each agent, on average, should receive about 1 or 2 items. 

However, as the goal is to ensure fairness, we should aim for an allocation where each agent is satisfied with their set of items based on their valuations. To do so, let's try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations.

Here is one possible allocation that attempts to satisfy these conditions:

1. **Agent 0:** Allocate items that have relatively high values for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Allocate items that are highly valued by Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Similarly, allocate items that maximize Agent 2's satisfaction.
4. **Agent 3:** Allocate items to maximize the value for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Allocate the remaining items that Agent 4 values highly.

Let's examine the agents' valuations and make an allocation:

- Agent 0 values items 0 (79) and 2 (84) highly.
- Agent 1 values item 5 (77) and 2 (80) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 5 (95) and 6 (74) highly.
- Agent 3 values items 1 (90) and 6 (85) highly.
- Agent 4 values item 6 (94) and 1 (73) highly.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [0, 2] (high value items for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1:** Items [5] (high value item for Agent 1).
- **Agent 2:** Items [3, 6] (ensuring high value for Agent 2).
- **Agent 3:** Items [1, 8] (high value items for Agent 3).
- **Agent 4:** Items [4, 7] (remaining items with reasonable value for Agent 4).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their valuations, providing a fair and envy-free distribution as much as possible within the constraints.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
