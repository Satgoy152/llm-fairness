Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  74  16  19  16  15  51  27  11
1  42  95  40  18  11  27  53  52  89
2  55  25  98  67  52  37  44  77  72
3   9  39  88  76  32  73  88  82  94
4  54  63  26  58  16  25  12  69  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we will aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy and attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives. We'll use the concept of maximizing the minimum value an agent perceives, a common approach in fair division.

Let's go through a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 0 (97) compared to others. We will allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 1 (95). We will allocate item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 2 (98). We will allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 8 highly (94). We will allocate item 8 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 3 the most (58). We will allocate item 3 to agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (4, 5, 6, 7) to minimize envy:

6. **Agent 0**: Among the remaining items, agent 0 values item 6 the most (51). We will allocate item 6 to agent 0.

7. **Agent 1**: Among the remaining items, agent 1 values item 7 the most (52). We will allocate item 7 to agent 1.

8. **Agent 2**: Among the remaining items, agent 2 values item 5 the most (37). We will allocate item 5 to agent 2.

9. **Agent 3**: The only remaining item is item 4, which will be allocated to agent 3.

This way, each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, with an attempt to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [8, 4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
