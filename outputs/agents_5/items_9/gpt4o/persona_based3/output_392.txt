Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  12  88  51   8  41   5  66  23
1  67  40  10  69  77  61  53  38  32
2  74   3   3  32  56  89  44  66  85
3   6  88  52  68  66  49  68  91  21
4  81  69  48  97  72  48  10  30  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should not prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. One common approach to achieve this is the "round-robin" or "sequential picking" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued remaining item. Given the valuations provided, we can simulate this process.

Let's conduct a round-robin allocation:

1. **Round 1**:
   - Agent 0 picks Item 2 (value 88).
   - Agent 1 picks Item 4 (value 77).
   - Agent 2 picks Item 5 (value 89).
   - Agent 3 picks Item 7 (value 91).
   - Agent 4 picks Item 3 (value 97).

2. **Round 2**:
   - Agent 0 picks Item 0 (value 71).
   - Agent 1 picks Item 3 (value 69) - already taken by Agent 4, so next highest available, Item 5 (value 61) - already taken by Agent 2, so next highest available, Item 1 (value 40).
   - Agent 2 picks Item 8 (value 85).
   - Agent 3 picks Item 1 (value 88) - already taken by Agent 1, so next highest available, Item 4 (value 66) - already taken by Agent 1, so next highest available, Item 6 (value 68).
   - Agent 4 picks Item 0 (value 81) - already taken by Agent 0, so next highest available, Item 1 (value 69).

3. **Round 3**:
   - Agent 0 picks Item 7 (value 66) - already taken by Agent 3, so next highest available, Item 3 (value 51).
   - Agent 1 picks Item 8 (value 32) - already taken by Agent 2, so next highest available, Item 0 (value 67) - already taken by Agent 0, so next highest available, Item 2 (value 10).
   - Agent 2 picks Item 6 (value 44) - already taken by Agent 3, so next highest available, Item 1 (value 3).
   - Agent 3 picks Item 8 (value 21) - already taken by Agent 2, so next highest available, Item 0 (value 6).
   - Agent 4 has already picked two items.

Below is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 1, 2],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [7, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent picks items based on their preferences while ensuring that the items are fairly distributed among them.
