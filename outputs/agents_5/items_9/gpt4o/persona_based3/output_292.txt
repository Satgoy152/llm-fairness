Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  31  22  79  45  18  40  25  11
1  57  44  48  49  80  24  36  96  51
2  83  18   0  41  79  51  42  88  33
3  91  75  39  56  60  39  96  36  85
4  69  99   2  43  53  80  74  99  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or as close to envy-free distribution as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as that of any other agent, based on their own valuations.

Here's an approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Identify High Valuation Matches**: Assign items to agents who value them the highest, ensuring at least a good start toward envy-freeness.

2. **Balance Allocations**: Adjust allocations to make sure each agent has a fair share and no one is left without items unless it results in a more balanced distribution.

3. **Check for Envy**: Ensure that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuation.

Following this approach, here's a fair allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 gets item 0: Highest valuation for item 0 is by agent 3, but agent 0 also values it significantly and gets less otherwise.
- Agent 1 gets item 7: Highest valuation for item 7.
- Agent 2 gets items 5 and 8: Significant valuation for these, and balances the distribution.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 6: High valuation for item 6, and decent for item 3.
- Agent 4 gets items 1, 2, and 4: High valuation for item 1 and decent for item 4, and balances the distribution.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has items distributed based on their preferences, aiming for a fair and envy-free scenario.
