Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  62  36  65  51  56  45  44  95
1  83  74  91  94  10   9  15   5  60
2  31  47  78   9   5  28  44  64  26
3  26  85  46  36  56  11  37   3  31
4  58  79  89   3  77  94  89  92  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the 9 items among the 5 agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. This means each agent should feel that they are getting a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's start by examining the individual valuations to identify any clear preferences or potential allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 8 (95).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (94).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (78).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (85).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (94).

To ensure fairness, we can start by assigning each agent their highest-valued item. Then, we distribute the remaining items to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 8 and 0
  - Total valuation: 95 + 77 = 172
- **Agent 1**: Items 3 and 2
  - Total valuation: 94 + 91 = 185
- **Agent 2**: Items 6 and 7
  - Total valuation: 44 + 64 = 108
- **Agent 3**: Item 1
  - Total valuation: 85
- **Agent 4**: Items 5 and 4
  - Total valuation: 94 + 77 = 171

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while distributing the total available items. There might be some agents with less total valuation than others, but given the constraint of integer item allocation and the initial preferences, this distribution is balanced.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 9 items and considers the agents' preferences as much as possible, given the constraints.
