Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52   8  12   0   6  35  17  54  49
1  42  61  17  42  90  12  94  45  19
2  61   7  12  74  95  21  90  93  64
3  79  97  87  68  73  18  79  90  79
4  18  12  72  25  72  37  45  78  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that ensures no agent envies another agent's allocation. This is known as an envy-free allocation, meaning each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation.

First, let's calculate the total value that each agent assigns to all items, which will help us understand how items might be distributed to maximize fairness:

- Agent 0: 52 + 8 + 12 + 0 + 6 + 35 + 17 + 54 + 49 = 233
- Agent 1: 42 + 61 + 17 + 42 + 90 + 12 + 94 + 45 + 19 = 422
- Agent 2: 61 + 7 + 12 + 74 + 95 + 21 + 90 + 93 + 64 = 517
- Agent 3: 79 + 97 + 87 + 68 + 73 + 18 + 79 + 90 + 79 = 670
- Agent 4: 18 + 12 + 72 + 25 + 72 + 37 + 45 + 78 + 14 = 373

Considering these total valuations, we'll allocate items with the goal of balancing the perceived value for each agent.

Let's proceed with a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: [0, 8]
   - Total Value: 52 + 49 = 101

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: [4, 6]
   - Total Value: 90 + 94 = 184

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items: [3, 5]
   - Total Value: 74 + 21 = 95

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items: [1, 2]
   - Total Value: 97 + 87 = 184

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Items: [7]
   - Total Value: 78

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of value across agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Finally, here is the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents, and each agent perceives their allocation as valuable based on their individual valuations.
