Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  63   8  53  14   7  53  45  77
1  68  52  85  30  86  73  65  85  70
2  28  51  54  71  26  82  37  95  79
3  96  25  29  66  58  73  46   4  48
4  21   3  42   5  82  90   7  17  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that considers the valuations and aims for envy-freeness as best as possible within the constraints. Given the valuations, we can approach this problem using the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) criterion, which often results in allocations that are envy-free up to one item (EF1).

Let's begin by examining the valuations and proceed to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 8 (77), followed by item 1 (63).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 4 (86), followed by item 2 (85).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 7 (95), followed by item 5 (82).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 0 (96), followed by item 5 (73).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 5 (90), followed by item 4 (82).

Based on these observations, we can try to allocate the items to maximize each agent's individual satisfaction while balancing overall fairness:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 8 (77).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 4 (86).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 7 (95).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 0 (96).
- **Agent 4**: Allocate item 5 (90).

Now, we need to allocate the remaining 4 items (1, 2, 3, 6) to minimize envy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 (63).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 2 (85).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 6 (37).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 (66).

All items are allocated, and we have attempted to respect the highest valuations for each agent to the extent possible. The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives items they highly value, while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item.
