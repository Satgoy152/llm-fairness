Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  99  69  74   3   1  57  55  76
1   7  93  88   2   1  30  97  39  25
2  90  64  24  27  10  11  89  80  66
3  22   4   5  68  18  26   2  67  48
4  57  59  92  41  78  99  51  73  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve envy-freeness. This means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own, according to their valuations. Given the matrix of valuations, we'll use an approach that attempts to balance the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

### Steps:
1. **Calculate total valuations**: Determine the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. **Initial allocation**: Assign items to agents in a way that attempts to maximize their total valuation.
3. **Adjust for fairness**: Ensure that no agent envies another by potentially redistributing items.

### Calculation:

1. **Total Valuations**: Calculate the sum of each agent's valuation of all items.
   - Agent 0: 83 + 99 + 69 + 74 + 3 + 1 + 57 + 55 + 76 = 517
   - Agent 1: 7 + 93 + 88 + 2 + 1 + 30 + 97 + 39 + 25 = 382
   - Agent 2: 90 + 64 + 24 + 27 + 10 + 11 + 89 + 80 + 66 = 461
   - Agent 3: 22 + 4 + 5 + 68 + 18 + 26 + 2 + 67 + 48 = 260
   - Agent 4: 57 + 59 + 92 + 41 + 78 + 99 + 51 + 73 + 84 = 634

2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations.
   - Agent 0: Allocates items with high valuations like 1, 0, 2
   - Agent 1: Allocates items like 6, 2
   - Agent 2: Allocates items like 0, 1
   - Agent 3: Allocates items like 3
   - Agent 4: Allocates items like 5, 4, 8

3. **Fair Allocation**:
   - Check if any agent envies another and adjust accordingly.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that no agent envies another with respect to their valuations. Note that the allocation process involves subjective decisions on how to balance total valuations while considering individual preferences and fairness.
