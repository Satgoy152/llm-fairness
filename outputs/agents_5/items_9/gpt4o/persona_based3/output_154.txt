Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87   0  89  42  34  48   0  70  15
1  37   3  58  17  71  29  65  88  46
2  36  32  54  27  35  79  47  18  24
3  40  52  39  78  73  16  39  73  44
4  11  86  78  61  91  70  54  83  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a set of items that minimizes envy. The goal is to achieve a distribution where each agent feels they have received a fair share according to their individual valuations. A common method for fair division is using an algorithm like the Envy-Free Matching or the Adjusted Winner Procedure, but given the constraints, we'll proceed with a simple yet effective approach for this specific setup.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 87 + 0 + 89 + 42 + 34 + 48 + 0 + 70 + 15 = 385
- Agent 1: 37 + 3 + 58 + 17 + 71 + 29 + 65 + 88 + 46 = 414
- Agent 2: 36 + 32 + 54 + 27 + 35 + 79 + 47 + 18 + 24 = 352
- Agent 3: 40 + 52 + 39 + 78 + 73 + 16 + 39 + 73 + 44 = 454
- Agent 4: 11 + 86 + 78 + 61 + 91 + 70 + 54 + 83 + 27 = 561

Given the total valuations, we can try to match the items to agents based on both maximizing the individual agent's valuation and minimizing envy. Here's a proposed allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0, as they value it highly (87).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4, who values it at 86, the highest among all agents.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, who also values it the highest at 89.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, who values it at 78, which is their highest valuation.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4, who values it at 91, the highest.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2, who values it the highest at 79.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1, who values it at 65, the highest.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 1, who values it at 88, the highest.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3, who values it at 44, which is a competitive value for them.

This allocation aims to balance the total value received by each agent while considering their individual preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated, adhering to the constraint given.
