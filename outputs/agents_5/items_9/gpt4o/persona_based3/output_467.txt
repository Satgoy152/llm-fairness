Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  19  23  78  43   6  60  91  10
1  19  75  59   5  55  92  44  84  37
2   5   3  65  83  20  82   0  35  29
3  92   4  87  42  72   6  12   7  34
4  15  57  53  45  19  13   3  64  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use several methods. One possible approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking items in a sequence determined by their valuations. This method can help in reducing the chances of envy among agents.

Let's start by analyzing the given valuations and proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. **Assign items based on maximum value:** Each agent should get an item that they value highly to start the allocation, reducing potential envy.

2. **Continue assigning based on remaining high valuations:** After the initial allocation, continue to assign items by considering the remaining highest valuations for each agent.

**Step-by-step allocation:**

- **Agent 0:** Item 7 (value 91)
- **Agent 1:** Item 5 (value 92)
- **Agent 2:** Item 3 (value 83)
- **Agent 3:** Item 0 (value 92)
- **Agent 4:** Item 8 (value 99)

After the initial assignment, the remaining items are [1, 2, 4, 6].

- **Agent 0:** Already got item 7. Next best item is 6 (value 60).
- **Agent 1:** Already got item 5. Next best item is 1 (value 75).
- **Agent 2:** Already got item 3. Next best item is 2 (value 65).
- **Agent 3:** Already got item 0. Next best item is 4 (value 72).

All items have now been allocated, and each agent has received a fair share based on their valuations.

**Final Allocations in JSON format:**

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest preferences, minimizing envy.
