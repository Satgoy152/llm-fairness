Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  79  61  11   3  22   7  51  38
1  55   0   9  80  26  88  80  75  51
2  65  98  57  90  51  43  51   9   0
3  98  23  58  32  30  32   5  56  15
4  72   7  24  74  16  62  65  48  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and maximizing total valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction based on their valuation. We'll use a method that considers maximizing the minimum satisfaction among agents and ensuring each one gets a fair share of the total value.

Given the valuations, we can approach this by:

1. Assigning items to agents based on their highest value items while ensuring that each agent gets a share that minimizes envy.
2. Trying to balance the distribution of high-value items among agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0, 1, and 2. We'll try to give them some of these high-value items.
- Agent 1 has a strong preference for items 3, 5, and 6.
- Agent 2 values item 1 very highly and prefers item 3 as well.
- Agent 3 highly values item 0 and item 2.
- Agent 4 has a preference for item 0 and item 3.

Let's allocate based on these preferences, ensuring no agent is overly envious:

1. Agent 0: [0, 2] (values 73 and 61)
2. Agent 1: [5, 6] (values 88 and 80)
3. Agent 2: [1, 3] (values 98 and 90)
4. Agent 3: [7] (value 56)
5. Agent 4: [4, 8] (values 16 and 36)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are of relatively high value to them, attempting to minimize envy. 

Here is the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4, 8]
}
```
