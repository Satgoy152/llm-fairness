Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  21  59   7  34  87  88   7  72
1  28  12  69   8  95  60  90  39  50
2  19   8  72  33  50  80  85  23  37
3  58  95  11  87  64  16  86  81  75
4   0  48  29   4  42  40  30  10  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We will attempt to find a balanced allocation that minimizes envy.

Here is a proposed allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for items 5 and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 4 and 2.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for items 5 and 6, but 5 is already taken, so take item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for items 1 and 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Take remaining items.

Considering the above observations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 4, 2
- Agent 2: Item 8
- Agent 3: Items 1, 3
- Agent 4: Items 0, 7

This allocation aims to balance the high valuations each agent has for different items while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```
