Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  53  86   4  55  36   0  68  57
1  26  87  40  27  19  50  70  75  95
2  62  35  88  77  23  24  80  85  68
3  75  45  31  57  75   8  59  41  71
4   9  62   3  83  50  72   9  83  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a method that aims to achieve envy-freeness as closely as possible. One approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where each agent picks their most valued remaining item in turns. However, given the specific requirement, I'll compute a possible allocation manually to ensure the total valuation is distributed as evenly as possible.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation items: 2 (86), 7 (68), 8 (57), 4 (55)
   - Allocate items: 2, 7
   - Total value: 86 + 68 = 154

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation items: 8 (95), 1 (87), 6 (70), 7 (75)
   - Allocate items: 8, 1
   - Total value: 95 + 87 = 182

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation items: 2 (88), 7 (85), 6 (80), 3 (77)
   - Allocate items: 6, 3
   - Total value: 80 + 77 = 157

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation items: 0 (75), 4 (75), 8 (71), 3 (57)
   - Allocate items: 0, 4
   - Total value: 75 + 75 = 150

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Remaining items: 5
   - Allocate items: 5
   - Total value: 72

This allocation results in each agent getting items and minimizes envy by trying to ensure each agent receives items close to their highest value. The total number of items allocated is 9, meeting the requirement.

### Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [8, 1],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and tries to balance the total valuation among agents as evenly as possible given the constraints.
