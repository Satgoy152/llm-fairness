Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  94  47  56  12  66  41  27  34
1  34  54  57  63   7  12  48  75  15
2  38  71  82  78  36   4  54  14  64
3  59   3  36  41  47  97   9  31  94
4  79  46  69  28  65  99   0  54  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items in a fair manner, we need to consider a method that takes into account the differing valuations of items by each agent. One approach is to use a round-robin allocation method based on each agent's highest-valued unallocated item, ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. Identify the agent who values the most valuable unallocated item the highest.
2. Allocate that item to the agent.
3. Repeat the process until all items are allocated.

Starting with the initial table:

```
Agent Valuations:
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  94  47  56  12  66  41  27  34
1  34  54  57  63   7  12  48  75  15
2  38  71  82  78  36   4  54  14  64
3  59   3  36  41  47  97   9  31  94
4  79  46  69  28  65  99   0  54  77
```

Following the round-robin method:

1. Item 5: Highest bid (99) by agent 4. Allocate item 5 to agent 4.
2. Item 1: Highest bid (94) by agent 0. Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
3. Item 8: Highest bid (94) by agent 3. Allocate item 8 to agent 3.
4. Item 3: Highest bid (78) by agent 2. Allocate item 3 to agent 2.
5. Item 7: Highest bid (75) by agent 1. Allocate item 7 to agent 1.
6. Item 2: Highest bid (82) by agent 2. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
7. Item 0: Highest bid (79) by agent 4. Allocate item 0 to agent 4.
8. Item 6: Highest bid (54) by agent 2. Allocate item 6 to agent 2.
9. Item 4: Highest bid (65) by agent 4. Allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Now, each agent receives the following items:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [3, 2, 6]
- Agent 3: [8]
- Agent 4: [5, 0, 4]

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3, 2, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [5, 0, 4]
}
```
