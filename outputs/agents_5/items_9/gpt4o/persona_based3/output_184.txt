Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0  94  35  61  22  24  93  53  77
1  24  86  74  56  77  45  10  27  64
2  41  56  42  54  68  55  56  64  71
3  92  35  87  27  20   7   8  62  35
4  27  33   1   8  25  77  79  83  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness among the 5 agents, we need to allocate the 9 items such that each agent perceives their allocation as fair based on their valuations. Since each agent values items differently, we aim to distribute the items in a way that minimizes envy.

Given the valuation table, here's a strategic approach to allocate items:

1. Identify high-value items for each agent and try to ensure they receive at least some items they value highly.
2. Ensure that the total perceived value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (94) and item 6 (93), so let's assign those to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 (74) and item 4 (77) highly, so let's assign those to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 8 (71) and has a balanced valuation across other items, so let's assign item 8 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 (92) and item 2 (87) highly, but item 2 is already assigned, so let's assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 (77) and item 6 (79) highly, but item 6 is already assigned, so let's assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated. The remaining items are 3 and 7. We should distribute these to balance the remaining value:

- Agent 0 could receive item 3 (61 for them).
- Agent 3 could receive item 7 (62 for them).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value while attempting to minimize envy.
