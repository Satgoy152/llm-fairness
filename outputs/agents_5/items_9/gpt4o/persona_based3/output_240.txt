Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  96  51  50  30  96  12   2   0
1  96  26  56  97  40  44  60  96  88
2  57   9  50  56  93  93   2  62  10
3  44  52  54  64  98  25  36  26  65
4  58   1  38  44  73  73  56  80  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that considers each agent's valuations and attempts to distribute the items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the table of valuations, we'll try to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring all items are allocated.

The process involves analyzing the valuations and distributing items to optimize for fairness. A common approach is to use a round-robin or a greedy algorithm to ensure each agent receives items they value highly.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values are for items 1 and 5. Assign items [1, 5] to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values are for items 0 and 3. Assign items [0, 3] to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value is for item 4. Assign item [4] to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Next highest values are for items 8 and 3 (already taken). Assign item [8] to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value is for item 7. Assign item [7] to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items [2, 6]:

- Assign item [2] to Agent 3, as it is their next highest value.
- Assign item [6] to Agent 4, as it is their next highest value after item 7.

After ensuring all items are allocated and each agent has a reasonable distribution, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [8, 2],
    "4": [7, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to be fair by considering each agent's highest-valued items and distributing them to minimize envy.
