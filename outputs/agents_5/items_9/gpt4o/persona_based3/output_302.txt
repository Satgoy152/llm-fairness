Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  21  17  17  85  10  75   0  88
1  89  73  39  83  90  36  71  74  15
2  57  10  54  98  17  71  91  56  98
3  53  43  66  51  12  53  48  83  61
4  32  57  56  88  34   9  25  26  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that their share of the items is at least as valuable as the share of any other agent, according to their own valuations. 

Let's approach this problem by analyzing the valuations and finding an allocation that seems fair based on these values.

### Steps:
1. **Identify High-Value Items:** First, identify which items are valued highly by different agents.
2. **Assign Unique High-Value Items:** Preferably, assign these high-value items to agents who value them the most.
3. **Distribute Remaining Items:** Continue distributing the remaining items by considering each agent's total valuation to ensure balance.

### Valuation Analysis:
- **Agent 0**: Values items 4 (85), 8 (88), 6 (75) highly.
- **Agent 1**: Values items 0 (89), 4 (90), 3 (83) highly.
- **Agent 2**: Values items 3 (98), 6 (91), 8 (98) highly.
- **Agent 3**: Values items 2 (66), 7 (83) highly.
- **Agent 4**: Values items 3 (88) highly.

### Proposed Allocation:
- **Agent 0:** Gets items 4 and 8. These are among the highest valued by Agent 0 and relatively not as highly valued by others.
- **Agent 1:** Gets items 0 and 3. Item 0 is highly valued by Agent 1, and item 3 is also one of the higher valued items.
- **Agent 2:** Gets items 6 and 2. Item 6 is highly valued by Agent 2, and item 2 is moderately valued by them.
- **Agent 3:** Gets item 7. Item 7 is highly valued by Agent 3.
- **Agent 4:** Gets items 1 and 5. These items are moderately valued by Agent 4.

### Final Allocation:
This allocation tries to assign items such that each agent receives some of their highly valued items, minimizing envy among them.

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent has a share that is intended to be as fair as possible based on their valuation of the items.
