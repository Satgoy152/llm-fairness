Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  69  77  61  37  76  80  12  52
1  71  72  58  37  88  52   5  34  83
2  87  34  85  86  35  25  65  61  45
3  71  50  42   1  51  56  57  54  93
4  96  20  27  99  41  50  86  21  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for a fair division that respects the principles of envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the valuations, one approach is to use the method known as the "Envy-Free Matching" or "Round Robin" method. This involves iteratively assigning the most preferred available item to each agent in turn, based on their valuations.

We'll go through several rounds, each time allowing each agent to choose their most preferred item from the remaining items. This process will continue until all items are allocated.

### Allocation Steps:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 chooses item 0 (value 87).
   - Agent 1 chooses item 4 (value 88).
   - Agent 2 chooses item 3 (value 86).
   - Agent 3 chooses item 8 (value 93).
   - Agent 4 chooses item 7 (value 21).

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 chooses item 6 (value 80).
   - Agent 1 chooses item 8 (value was already chosen by Agent 3, so chooses item 1, value 72).
   - Agent 2 chooses item 2 (value 85).
   - Agent 3 already has an item.
   - Agent 4 chooses item 0 (value was already chosen by Agent 0, so chooses item 5, value 50).

3. **Round 3:**
   - Only item 5 is left.
   - Agent 0 and Agent 4 both have two items. Agent 3 has one item but has the highest value item. Therefore, allocate item 5 to Agent 1 or Agent 3 to balance the number of items per agent.

4. **Final Adjustments:**
   - To ensure balance and fairness, Agent 1 has two items, Agent 2 has two items, Agent 3 has one item, and Agent 4 has two items. Agent 0 has two items. We can allocate item 5 to Agent 3 to ensure each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is nine.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [8, 5],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the number of items among agents while respecting their valuations and ensuring that each agent is as satisfied as possible given the constraints.
