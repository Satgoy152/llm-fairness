Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  62  94  32  86  39   6  76  47
1  97  25  78  70  50  52   9  25  41
2  44  99  78  12  14  58  77  71  49
3  47   7  17   2  49  19  27  39  15
4  59  63  18  40  56   4  93  59  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[22 62 94 32 86 39  6 76 47]
 [97 25 78 70 50 52  9 25 41]
 [44 99 78 12 14 58 77 71 49]
 [47  7 17  2 49 19 27 39 15]
 [59 63 18 40 56  4 93 59 95]]
Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which seeks to maximize the product of the utilities of all agents. This method helps to balance fairness and efficiency.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [22, 62, 94, 32, 86, 39,  6, 76, 47]
Agent 1: [97, 25, 78, 70, 50, 52,  9, 25, 41]
Agent 2: [44, 99, 78, 12, 14, 58, 77, 71, 49]
Agent 3: [47,  7, 17,  2, 49, 19, 27, 39, 15]
Agent 4: [59, 63, 18, 40, 56,  4, 93, 59, 95]
```

We need to allocate 9 items across 5 agents. Let's aim for an allocation such that the product of utilities (valuations) is maximized:

1. Assign items with the highest individual valuation to each agent if possible.
2. Balance the remaining items to maximize fairness and reduce envy.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4 (Valuations = 94, 86)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (Valuation = 97)
- Agent 2: Items 1, 6 (Valuations = 99, 77)
- Agent 3: Items 3, 8 (Valuations = 2, 15)
- Agent 4: Items 5, 7 (Valuations = 4, 59)

This allocation attempts to give each agent items with high valuations for them when possible, while distributing the total number of items fairly.

Now, let's format this allocation into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with a focus on maximizing the satisfaction of each agent and minimizing envy.
