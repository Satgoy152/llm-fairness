Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  47  97  64  12  23  59  80  87
1  12  69  90  47   8  50  54  35  79
2  48  53  34  55  20  61  35  91  32
3  85  65  73  59   6  56   7  84  53
4  58  67  30  77  15  76   0  51  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness and try to ensure each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. Given there's a total of 9 items and 5 agents, each agent should ideally get about 1 or 2 items.

Using a simple algorithm to ensure fairness, we can proceed as follows:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items to agents such that each agent gets items they value relatively highly while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation.

Here's how the allocations can be designed:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 2 (97), 8 (87)
   - Allocated items: [2]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued items: 2 (90), 1 (69), 8 (79)
   - Allocated items: [1, 8]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued items: 7 (91), 5 (61)
   - Allocated items: [7]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued items: 0 (85), 7 (84)
   - Allocated items: [0]

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valued items: 8 (90), 5 (76)
   - Allocated items: [3, 5, 6, 4]

After ensuring each agent receives a fair allocation based on their preferences, the final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 5, 6, 4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance each agent's preferences and the total number of items assigned.
