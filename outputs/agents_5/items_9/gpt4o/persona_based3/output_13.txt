Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  97  73  78  28  36  62  75  77
1  39   1   2  13  80  68  58  88  26
2  42  82  28   2  71  48  79  50  85
3   3  23  25  60  58  93  16  94  95
4  35  26   9  80  90  99  51  92  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a concept from fair division called "maximin share." The idea is to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as they would value if they were to divide the items themselves into fair parts.

A more straightforward approach is to aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, where no agent wishes to swap their allocation with another.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Values: [23, 97, 73, 78, 28, 36, 62, 75, 77]
   - Top valued items: 1, 3, 2

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values: [39, 1, 2, 13, 80, 68, 58, 88, 26]
   - Top valued items: 7, 4

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values: [42, 82, 28, 2, 71, 48, 79, 50, 85]
   - Top valued items: 8, 1

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values: [3, 23, 25, 60, 58, 93, 16, 94, 95]
   - Top valued items: 8, 7

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Values: [35, 26, 9, 80, 90, 99, 51, 92, 62]
   - Top valued items: 5, 4

Based on the above analysis, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [1, 3]
- **Agent 1:** Items [7]
- **Agent 2:** Items [8]
- **Agent 3:** Items [6]
- **Agent 4:** Items [0, 2, 4, 5]

This allocation aims to ensure each agent receives a bundle that they value highly and minimizes potential envy among agents.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 2, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item.
