Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  71  68  33  73  91  88  57  58
1   4  97  67  88  40  86  76  40  73
2  97  12  55  19  75  69  81  12  91
3  18  20  19   5  74  25  72  25  96
4  31  75  13  86  98  84  41  59  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use an approach that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items in such a way that minimizes envy, where possible.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 53 + 71 + 68 + 33 + 73 + 91 + 88 + 57 + 58 = 592
- Agent 1: 4 + 97 + 67 + 88 + 40 + 86 + 76 + 40 + 73 = 571
- Agent 2: 97 + 12 + 55 + 19 + 75 + 69 + 81 + 12 + 91 = 511
- Agent 3: 18 + 20 + 19 + 5 + 74 + 25 + 72 + 25 + 96 = 354
- Agent 4: 31 + 75 + 13 + 86 + 98 + 84 + 41 + 59 + 97 = 584

Next, let's allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

1. **Agent 1** highly values item 1, so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2** highly values item 0, so we assign item 0 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 0** highly values item 5, so we assign item 5 to Agent 0.
4. **Agent 4** highly values item 4, so we assign item 4 to Agent 4.
5. **Agent 3** highly values item 8, so we assign item 8 to Agent 3.

Now, we continue the allocation by considering the next highest valuations:

6. **Agent 4** values item 3 highly after item 4, so we assign item 3 to Agent 4.
7. **Agent 0** values item 6 highly after item 5, so we assign item 6 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 2** values item 2 highly after item 0, so we assign item 2 to Agent 2.
9. **Agent 1** values item 7 highly after item 1, so we assign item 7 to Agent 1.

Here is the distribution of items among the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and aims to satisfy each agent's preferences as much as possible, thereby reducing envy.
