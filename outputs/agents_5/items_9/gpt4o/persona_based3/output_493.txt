Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  13  84  94  73  42  17  45  12
1  23  40  61  84  34  48   3  10  13
2  25  28  52  49  19  13  99  53  51
3  43  66  43   2  55  78  76   0  48
4   1  53  90  99   3  78  88  56  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we will aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated.

An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer constraints and a small number of items, we will aim for a distribution where each agent is as satisfied as possible based on their valuations.

Let's examine the valuations and attempt to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 0, 3, 2, and 4 highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the most, followed by item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 6 the most, with item 8 also being significant.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 5, 6, and 1.
5. **Agent 4**: Values items 3, 2, and 6 highly.

Given these preferences, we can attempt the following allocation to balance the overall satisfaction:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item 0 (highest value for agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 3 (highest value for agent 1).
- **Agent 2**: Gets items 6 and 8 (highest and third-highest values for agent 2).
- **Agent 3**: Gets items 5 and 1 (second and third-highest values for agent 3).
- **Agent 4**: Gets items 2, 4, and 7 (highest, fourth-highest, and fifth-highest values for agent 4).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value relatively highly, aiming to minimize envy.

Here is the allocation in the specified json format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [5, 1],
    "4": [2, 4, 7]
}
```
