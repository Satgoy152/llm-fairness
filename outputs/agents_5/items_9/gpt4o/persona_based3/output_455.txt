Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39   6  12  79  59  73   7  73  78
1  18  67  22   6  44  11  86  72  85
2  43  68  50  90  31  31  25   6  91
3  30  70  86  10  86  88  89  93  90
4  77  67  37  97  92  45  12  41  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering each agent's valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation. An allocation is envy-free if and only if each agent values their own bundle of goods at least as much as they value any other agent's bundle of goods.

Let's proceed by attempting to distribute the items in a way that approximates fairness and minimizes envy. One heuristic approach is to use the "maximum marginal value" strategy, where each agent picks the item that maximizes their marginal gain based on the items left.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: [0, 3]
   - Justification: Agent 0 has high valuations for item 0 and item 3.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: [1, 8]
   - Justification: Agent 1 has high valuations for item 1 and item 8.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: [2, 6]
   - Justification: Agent 2 has a reasonable valuation for items 2 and 6, which are less valued by others.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: [5, 7]
   - Justification: Agent 3 has high valuations for items 5 and 7.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items: [4]
   - Justification: Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4.

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items based on their individual valuations. The distribution of items seeks to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```
