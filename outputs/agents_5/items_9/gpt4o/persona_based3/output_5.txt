Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  80  58  83  83  75  45  94  31
1  22  24  99  65  50  13  15  48  39
2  96  22  39  19  21  60  85  63  70
3  99  49  94  92  71  75  30  41  98
4  83  49  18  65  56  15   9  57  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items among the agents, we'll use the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. We'll aim to allocate the items such that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations.

The goal is to allocate all 9 items to the 5 agents. We must ensure that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible, considering their individual valuations.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: [7 (94), 3 (83)]
   - Allocate items 7 and 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value item: [2 (99)]
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: [0 (96), 6 (85)]
   - Allocate items 0 and 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value items: [8 (98), 4 (71)]
   - Allocate items 8 and 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest value item remaining: [1 (49), 5 (15)]
   - Allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 4.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

Each agent is allocated a distinct set of items, and all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents. This allocation aims to maximize the individual satisfaction of each agent based on their item valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
