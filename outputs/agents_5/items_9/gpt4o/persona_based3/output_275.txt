Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  44  82  65  18  25  63  83  97
1  96  56  29  48  13  94  45  47  21
2  22  60  39  88  99  21  79  33  51
3  47  15  97  19  83  67  74  44   6
4  63   0  21  24  48   4  38  64  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy, though achieving perfect envy-freeness might not be possible given the constraints. We'll try to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** values item 8 the highest (97). Assign item 8 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (96). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (99). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the highest (97). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 7 the highest (64). Assign item 7 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 4 more items:

6. **Agent 0** has a good valuation for item 7 (83), but it is already allocated. Next, consider assigning item 3 (65) to Agent 0.
7. **Agent 1** has a good valuation for item 5 (94). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
8. **Agent 2** has a good valuation for item 6 (79). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
9. **Agent 3** has the best remaining valuation for item 1 (15). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [2, 1],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives items with relatively high valuations according to their preferences, while also trying to balance the number of items distributed to each agent.
