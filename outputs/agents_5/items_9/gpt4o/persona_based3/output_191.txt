Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  40  57  61  30   2  88  13  86
1  83  98  65  84  35  49  90  82  65
2  20  12  92  30  28  42  37  48  57
3  82  37  41  66  81  71  94  15  20
4  21   0  14  49   5  47   8  66  73

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations of the agents for each item, let's attempt to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

One approach to achieve this is by considering the valuations and attempting to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Let's perform an allocation that aims to balance these valuations as fairly as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 6 (88) and item 8 (86). This gives a total value of 174.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 1 (98) and item 3 (84). This results in a value of 182.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign items 2 (92) and 5 (42) for a total value of 134.
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 0 (82), item 4 (81), and item 7 (15). This gives a total value of 178.
5. **Agent 4**: Gets item 7 (66) and item 8 (73). This totals 139.

By distributing items in this manner, we aim to balance the high-value items across the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Note that the assignment is not perfectly envy-free due to the integer constraint and the limited number of items, but it attempts to balance perceived fairness in terms of total valuation.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to balance the total value each agent receives, within the constraints of the problem.
