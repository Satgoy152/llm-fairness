Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  68  31   3  18  12  61  54  82
1  80  59  62  87  30  15  36  73  86
2  98   8  72  65  78  10  37  49  72
3  87  13  80  86  42  11  68  48  88
4  13  31  37  44  44  35  59  58  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to ensure an envy-free distribution where possible, or at least minimize envy. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, we will allocate items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Each agent values items differently. We'll attempt to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's total perceived value while trying to keep the allocations balanced across agents.
   - There are 9 items and 5 agents, so some agents will receive more items than others.

2. **Allocations:**
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 8.
   - Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 8.
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
   - Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 8.
   - Agent 4 has high valuations for item 8.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Allocate items 1 and 8. (Total value: 68 + 82 = 150)
- **Agent 1:** Allocate items 3 and 7. (Total value: 87 + 73 = 160)
- **Agent 2:** Allocate items 0 and 4. (Total value: 98 + 78 = 176)
- **Agent 3:** Allocate items 2 and 6. (Total value: 80 + 68 = 148)
- **Agent 4:** Allocate item 5. (Total value: 35)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a combination of high-value items according to their preferences, attempting to balance total values across agents while ensuring all items are allocated.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents, and each agent's allocation reflects their individual valuations as closely as possible, given the constraints.
