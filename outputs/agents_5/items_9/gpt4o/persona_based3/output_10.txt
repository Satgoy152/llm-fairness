Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  76  93  30  61   0  31  68  24
1  54  27  85  21  69  41  94   7  75
2  71  48  96  72   9  12   4  32  42
3  92  88  39  12  78  85  91  66  25
4   7  95  91  90  79  92  12  40  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, let's attempt to distribute the items such that each agent's valuation for their own bundle is as high as possible, and no agent would prefer someone else's allocation over their own.

Given the valuation table, we can aim for a distribution where each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their personal value, while ensuring that no agent envies another's allocation.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Allocate items: [2, 7]
   - Total value: 93 (for item 2) + 68 (for item 7) = 161

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Allocate items: [6, 8]
   - Total value: 94 (for item 6) + 75 (for item 8) = 169

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Allocate items: [0, 3]
   - Total value: 71 (for item 0) + 72 (for item 3) = 143

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Allocate items: [1, 5]
   - Total value: 88 (for item 1) + 85 (for item 5) = 173

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Allocate items: [4]
   - Total value: 79 (for item 4)

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their assigned items. Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
