Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  63  98  60  45  96  20  50  13
1  47  35  60  52  99  50   6  59   6
2  35  66  94  56  84  63  52  19   0
3  54  31  94  87  62   6  79  13   0
4  87  56  68  44  20  75  17  84  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use the method of maximizing the minimum utility each agent receives. This approach focuses on ensuring that the agent who values their allocation the least is as satisfied as possible, thus promoting fairness.

Given the valuations, let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 2 the highest at 98. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values item 4 the highest at 99. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values item 2 the highest, but it's already taken. Next highest is item 4, which is also taken. Then, item 5 is valued at 63. Assign item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values item 3 the highest at 87. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Values item 0 the highest at 87. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (1, 6, 7, 8):

6. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest remaining value is item 1 at 63. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.

7. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest remaining value is item 3, which is taken. Next is item 6 at 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.

8. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining highest is item 6, which is taken. Next is item 1 at 66. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

9. **Agent 3**:
   - Remaining highest is item 6, which is taken. Next is item 7 at 13. Assign item 7 to Agent 3.

10. **Agent 4**:
    - Remaining highest is item 1, which is taken. Next is item 8 at 12. Assign item 8 to Agent 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [0, 8]
}
``` 

This allocation respects the constraint of each agent getting an integer number of items, ensures that all 9 items are allocated, and aims to maximize the minimum utility, promoting a fair distribution.
