Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  10  96  44  45  44  17  70  45
1  53  32  20  55  15  28  70  16  33
2  95  41  32  34  95   1  34  54  36
3  27  99  82  35  46  18  54  25  14
4  33  33  91  81  58  13  91  33  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we aim to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the valuations of each agent for each item, we can use methods such as the "round-robin" allocation or other heuristic approaches that aim to minimize envy.

Let's proceed with a round-robin allocation approach, beginning with the agent who has the highest single item valuation, and then proceed to allocate items sequentially to each agent based on their next highest unallocated item valuation. This approach doesn't guarantee envy-freeness but is a practical method for fair division in this context.

1. Identify the agent with the highest valuation for any item.
2. Allocate that item to the identified agent.
3. Remove the allocated item from consideration for the remaining allocations.
4. Repeat the process for the remaining items.

Following this approach, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (96).
- Agent 3 has the highest remaining valuation for item 1 (99).
- Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for item 0 (95).
- Agent 4 has the highest remaining valuation for item 2 (91), but item 2 is already allocated, so we consider the next highest for agent 4, which is item 6 (91).
- Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation for item 6 (70), but item 6 is already allocated, so we consider their next highest unallocated item, which is item 3 (55).
- Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 6, 7]
}
```

Each agent receives a set of items that, according to the round-robin method, should be as fair as possible given the constraints of the problem.
