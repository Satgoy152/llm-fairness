Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  15   9  92  30  31  18  46  56
1  50   6  21  64   3  51  38  27  95
2  77  12   9  24  73  47  74   1  85
3  80  75  54  16  96  23  73  90  67
4  86   5  62  94  32  18  50  92  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we should try to allocate items in such a way that each agent is satisfied with their share, ideally minimizing envy amongst them. Given the preference matrix, we can begin by checking each agent's valuations and try to assign items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent.

Here's a proposed allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuation for item 0 (99) and item 3 (92). Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 8 highly (95). Assign item 8 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 2 (9) and item 6 (74). Assign these items to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for item 4 (96) and item 7 (90). Assign these items to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Strongly values item 1 (5) and item 5 (18). Assign these items to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on one of their higher value preferences, attempting to minimize envy.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 5 agents, aiming for fairness based on their valuations.
