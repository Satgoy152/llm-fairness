Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  73   8  20   9  61  30  16  82
1  85  81  54  84  99  66  17  64  86
2  80  38  69  72  20  69  42  92  86
3  75  55  60  65  33  84  56   4  85
4  66  11   7  19  39  12  94  68  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim for a fair division approach that seeks to minimize envy among the agents. Envy-freeness is achieved when each agent feels they have received a bundle of items that is at least as good as any other agent's bundle based on their own valuation.

One method to achieve this is using the "round-robin" allocation process. This involves allowing agents to take turns picking their most valued item that remains unallocated. We'll start with the agent who has the highest single valuation for any item, and proceed in decreasing order of maximum valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Determine the maximum valuation for each agent:
   - Agent 0: Max value = 82 for item 8
   - Agent 1: Max value = 99 for item 4
   - Agent 2: Max value = 92 for item 7
   - Agent 3: Max value = 85 for item 8
   - Agent 4: Max value = 94 for item 6

2. Arrange agents in order of their maximum valuation:
   - Agent 1 (99), Agent 4 (94), Agent 2 (92), Agent 3 (85), Agent 0 (82)

3. Allocate items based on the ordered list:
   - Agent 1 selects item 4
   - Agent 4 selects item 6
   - Agent 2 selects item 7
   - Agent 3 selects item 8
   - Agent 0 selects item 0

4. Repeat the process until all items are allocated:
   - Agent 1 selects item 3
   - Agent 4 selects item 0 (already taken, so next best item 5)
   - Agent 2 selects item 2
   - Agent 3 selects item 1
   - Agent 0 selects item 0 (already taken, so next best item 5, already taken, next item 3, already taken, next item 1, already taken, next item 2, already taken, next item 4, already taken, next item 6, already taken, next item 7, already taken, next item 8, already taken, next item 9, next best item, item 1)

Upon successful allocation, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [7, 2],
    "3": [8, 1],
    "4": [6, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated, minimizing envy based on the agents' valuations.
