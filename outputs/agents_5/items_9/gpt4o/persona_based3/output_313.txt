Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  89   1  50  19  66  40  68  84
1   3  43  58  58  48  11  95  65  94
2  29   3  87  54   1  44  96   5   8
3  74  86  88  73  49  33  40  19  42
4  43  20  60  31   4  62  89  93  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations in the table, we need to distribute the items so that each agent feels they have received a fair share.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items**: Start by identifying items that are highly valued by one agent compared to others. This can help in minimizing envy.

2. **Allocate Unique High-Valuation Items**: Assign items that have a significantly higher value for one agent than others to that agent.

3. **Balance Remaining Allocations**: Distribute the remaining items by ensuring that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while trying to maintain fairness.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values item 0 (98), so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 6 (95), so allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 2 (87), so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 3 (73), and since it also has a decent valuation for item 0 which is already allocated, we allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 highly values item 7 (93), so allocate item 7 to Agent 4.

Now, distribute the remaining items (1, 4, 5, 8) to balance the overall allocation:

- Agent 0 has items: [0]
- Agent 1 has items: [6]
- Agent 2 has items: [2]
- Agent 3 has items: [3]
- Agent 4 has items: [7]

Remaining items: 1, 4, 5, 8.

- Item 1 has high valuation for Agent 3 (86), allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
- Item 4 has relatively balanced low value, allocate to Agent 0 to balance (they have only item 0, and item 4 is least valued by Agent 0).
- Item 5 is valued by Agent 0 (66) and Agent 4 (62), allocate to Agent 0 for better balance.
- Item 8 is valued by Agent 1 (94), allocate item 8 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [6, 8]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3, 1]
- Agent 4: [7]

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [7]
}
```
