Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  67  60  33  68  17  31   8  54
1  81  91  55  47  95  28  35  95  63
2  53  49  45  16  11  28   2  66  81
3  89   8  32  16   2  36  37   0   4
4  31  38  27  62   4  40   6  62  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a method such as the adjusted winner procedure or a similar heuristic approach. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness, especially with integer constraints, we'll aim for a balanced allocation that minimizes envy.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent derives from all items:

- Agent 0: 42 + 67 + 60 + 33 + 68 + 17 + 31 + 8 + 54 = 380
- Agent 1: 81 + 91 + 55 + 47 + 95 + 28 + 35 + 95 + 63 = 590
- Agent 2: 53 + 49 + 45 + 16 + 11 + 28 + 2 + 66 + 81 = 351
- Agent 3: 89 + 8 + 32 + 16 + 2 + 36 + 37 + 0 + 4 = 224
- Agent 4: 31 + 38 + 27 + 62 + 4 + 40 + 6 + 62 + 57 = 327

Now, let's try to allocate the items to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items:

1. Start by assigning items with the highest value for each agent, ensuring no overlap initially.
2. Adjust as necessary to balance out disparities and ensure each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 is assigned items [0, 4]
- Agent 1 is assigned items [1, 3]
- Agent 2 is assigned items [8]
- Agent 3 is assigned items [5, 6]
- Agent 4 is assigned items [2, 7]

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [2, 7]
}
```

Each agent receives a manageable number of items, and this allocation attempts to balance the perceived value distribution based on individual preferences.
