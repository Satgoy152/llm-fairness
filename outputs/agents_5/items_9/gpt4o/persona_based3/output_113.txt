Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73   8  54  87  97  55  91  41  88
1  37  15  27  38  89  20  12  34   8
2  41  17  10  95  80  60  68  23  26
3  69  67  74  51   2  64  40  49  66
4  74  80  98  75  15  29  62  91  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers the allocation of any other agent more than their own. Given the problem constraints, we will attempt to allocate the items such that each agent gets a fair share according to their valuations.

Let's begin by analyzing the total valuation each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 564
- Agent 1: 280
- Agent 2: 420
- Agent 3: 482
- Agent 4: 595

To achieve fairness, we should attempt to distribute the items such that each agent gets a portion of the total value proportional to the sum of their valuations. This is a heuristic approach, as it might not always result in a perfectly envy-free allocation, but it should be reasonably fair.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most.
2. Adjust allocations to ensure that each agent receives a roughly proportional share of their total valuation.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign item 4 (value 97), item 3 (value 87), item 8 (value 88).
- Agent 1: Assign item 1 (value 15).
- Agent 2: Assign item 5 (value 60), item 0 (value 41).
- Agent 3: Assign item 2 (value 74), item 7 (value 49).
- Agent 4: Assign item 6 (value 62).

Let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 receives items 4, 3, 8 with a total value of 272.
- Agent 1 receives item 1 with a total value of 15.
- Agent 2 receives items 5, 0 with a total value of 101.
- Agent 3 receives items 2, 7 with a total value of 123.
- Agent 4 receives item 6 with a total value of 62.

Each agent receives the items they value relatively well, given the constraints of integer allocations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3, 8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```
