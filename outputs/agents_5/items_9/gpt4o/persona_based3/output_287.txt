Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  37  14  44  28  94  45  79  10
1  88  23   1  90  45  67  71   7  47
2  92  96   7  25  61  60  70  52  42
3   3  60  91  70  77   0  84  62  47
4  13  25  28  77  78  22  29   6  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we can use the "round-robin" method, which is a common approach for fair division problems. This method involves each agent taking turns to choose their most valued available item until all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process for this problem:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation and Order Agents**: Calculate each agent's total valuation for all items and order the agents accordingly. Agents with higher total valuation go earlier in the round-robin allocation.

2. **Perform Round-Robin Allocation**: Agents take turns picking their most valued available item.

Here's the process detailed in steps:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**:
    - Agent 0: 442
    - Agent 1: 439
    - Agent 2: 505
    - Agent 3: 494
    - Agent 4: 337

2. **Order of Turns Based on Total Valuation**:
   - Agent 2, Agent 3, Agent 0, Agent 1, Agent 4

3. **Round-Robin Allocation**:
    - **Turn 1**:
      - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 96).
      - Agent 3 picks item 2 (value 91).
      - Agent 0 picks item 5 (value 94).
      - Agent 1 picks item 3 (value 90).
      - Agent 4 picks item 4 (value 78).

    - **Turn 2**:
      - Agent 2 picks item 6 (value 70).
      - Agent 3 picks item 7 (value 62).
      - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 91).
      - Agent 1 picks item 8 (value 47).

4. **Resulting Allocation**:
   - Agent 2: [1, 6]
   - Agent 3: [2, 7]
   - Agent 0: [5, 0]
   - Agent 1: [3, 8]
   - Agent 4: [4]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on their preference order, and every item is allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```
