Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  70  33  83  89  98  11  67  64
1  83  94  83   6  20  84  26  58  89
2  66  60  55  45   3  15  43   0  55
3  10  17  47  92  60  84  43  35  63
4  83  30  22  42  60  64  52   8  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free distribution where each agent values their allocated bundle at least as much as any other agent's bundle. We can employ a round-robin procedure based on each agent's highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet. Given the constraints, we will ensure that all 9 items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 1** gets item 1 (value 94).
2. **Agent 0** gets item 5 (value 98).
3. **Agent 3** gets item 3 (value 92).
4. **Agent 1** gets item 8 (value 89).
5. **Agent 0** gets item 4 (value 89).
6. **Agent 4** gets item 0 (value 83).
7. **Agent 2** gets item 2 (value 55).
8. **Agent 3** gets item 7 (value 35).
9. **Agent 2** gets item 6 (value 43).

Now all items have been allocated, and each agent has received an integer number of items. The aim has been to ensure that allocations are as fair as possible given the agents' valuations.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a collection of items, and the total number of items allocated equals 9, as required.
