Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  95  61  55  61  96  68  62  15
1  18  13  52  62  52   9  31  47  35
2  89  49  70  69  73  68  72  54  39
3  56  46  90  49  56  25  23  45  35
4  32  90  26  49  68  25   8   8  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an allocation that they value highly while maintaining envy-freeness as much as possible. Given the matrix of valuations, one approach is to use a maximin strategy, where we aim to maximize the minimum satisfaction of each agent.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step, considering each agent's preferences:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value items are item 5 (96), item 1 (95), and item 6 (68). Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value items are item 3 (62), item 2 (52), and item 4 (52). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value items are item 0 (89), item 4 (73), and item 6 (72). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value items are item 2 (90), item 0 (56), and item 4 (56). Assign item 2 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value items are item 1 (90), item 4 (68), and item 8 (57). Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Next, allocate the remaining items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and maintaining the fairness:

- **Remaining Items:** 5, 6, 7, 8
- **Agent 0:** Already has item 1. Next highest value items are item 5 (96) and item 6 (68). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Already has item 3. Next highest value items are item 7 (47) and item 8 (35). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Already has item 0. Next highest value items are item 5 (68) and item 6 (72). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Already has item 2. Next highest value items are item 0 (56) and item 8 (35). Assign item 8 to Agent 3.

Finally, check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 7]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [2, 8]
- Agent 4: Items [4]

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [4]
}
```
