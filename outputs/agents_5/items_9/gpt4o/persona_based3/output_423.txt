Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88   4   4  47  79  32  49  38  90
1  47  70  78  57  53  26   3   1  28
2  37  86  71  45   0  86  50  68  77
3  43   2  55  39  72  59  70  52  39
4  17  26  55   4   5  17  27  77  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's utility and trying to maintain a sense of fairness, such as minimizing envy among the agents. Given the constraints of an integer allocation and using the valuations provided, one potential method is to use the Envy-Free up to One Item (EF1) criterion, where each agent is as satisfied as possible with their allocation, and any potential envy can be resolved by removing at most one item from the envied allocation.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation is for item 8 (value 90), followed by item 0 (value 88). Assign these items to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation is for item 2 (value 78), followed by item 1 (value 70). Assign these items to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation is for item 1 (value 86) and item 5 (value 86). However, item 1 is already assigned. Assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation is for item 6 (value 70). Assign this item to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation is for item 7 (value 77). Assign this item to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 7 out of 9 items. We still need to allocate items 3 and 4.

- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (value 57) among unallocated items. However, item 3 is valued second-highest by Agent 0 (value 47). To balance, assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (value 72). Assign this item to Agent 3.

Let's summarize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6, 4],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's utility based on their highest valuations and distributes items in a way that aims to minimize envy.
