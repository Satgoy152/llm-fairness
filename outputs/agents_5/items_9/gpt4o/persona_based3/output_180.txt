Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  78  99  95  72  94  98  52  24
1  68  30  55  13  68  24  15  52  43
2  83  83   8   9  18   1  44  63  15
3  20   8  19  25  79  85   4  66  64
4  65   4  91  98  70  30  22  87  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that minimizes envy. In this context, envy occurs when an agent values another agent's allocation more than their own. One approach to achieve this is through a method known as maximum marginal utility, which attempts to assign items to agents based on where they provide the most additional value.

Let's start by considering the total values each agent assigns to all items and then allocate based on maximizing the marginal increase in utility for each agent.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
   - Agent 0: 700
   - Agent 1: 368
   - Agent 2: 314
   - Agent 3: 370
   - Agent 4: 510

2. **Allocate items to maximize marginal utility:**
   - Assign items by evaluating which agent values each item the most and ensure each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Specific Allocations:**
   - Item 0: Highest value is by Agent 0 (88)
   - Item 1: Highest value is by Agent 0 (78)
   - Item 2: Highest value is by Agent 0 (99)
   - Item 3: Highest value is by Agent 4 (98)
   - Item 4: Highest value is by Agent 3 (79)
   - Item 5: Highest value is by Agent 0 (94)
   - Item 6: Highest value is by Agent 0 (98)
   - Item 7: Highest value is by Agent 4 (87)
   - Item 8: Highest value is by Agent 3 (64)

4. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item:**
   - Re-evaluate allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item and redistribution based on maximizing remaining marginal utility.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [0, 2, 5]
   - Agent 1: [1]
   - Agent 2: [6]
   - Agent 3: [4, 8]
   - Agent 4: [3, 7]

This allocation aims to ensure each agent receives a fair distribution of items with as minimal envy as possible.

### JSON Output:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```
