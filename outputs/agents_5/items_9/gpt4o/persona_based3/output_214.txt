Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72   7  83  69  63  71  57  40  58
1  62  69  77   5  84  43  45  46  85
2  89  62  84  26  44  95  94  53  39
3   5  50  16   0  38  27  62  41  19
4  89  98   7  33  73  31  96   9  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that the allocation is as envy-free as possible. This means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations. Given the valuations provided, we can use the following approach:

1. Calculate the total value for each agent if they were to receive all items. This gives us an idea of their overall preference.
2. Allocate items one by one, trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their allocation.

Let's break down the process:

- Calculate the sum of valuations for each agent:
  - Agent 0: 520
  - Agent 1: 516
  - Agent 2: 586
  - Agent 3: 258
  - Agent 4: 449

- We'll start by allocating items to agents who value them the most, ensuring that the allocation remains as fair as possible.

Based on the above valuations, here's a fair allocation of the items:

- **Agent 0**: 0, 2 (Items 0 and 2 have high valuations for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: 4, 8 (Items 4 and 8 have high valuations for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: 5, 6 (Items 5 and 6 have high valuations for Agent 2)
- **Agent 3**: 3, 7 (Items 3 and 7 have reasonable valuations for Agent 3)
- **Agent 4**: 1  (Item 1 is highly valued by Agent 4)

Let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1]
}
``` 

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items according to each agent's valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.
