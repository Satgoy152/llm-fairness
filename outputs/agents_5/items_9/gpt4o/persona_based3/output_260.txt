Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  80  79  78  57  95  95  35  36
1  86   1  34  59  20  30   7  38   2
2  93  96  80  38  61  11  27   5   9
3  51  24  78  76   5  26  42  23  94
4  21  17  26  44  89  50  69  55  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure a balanced distribution of value according to each agent's valuations. We will use the concept of envy-freeness where possible, though perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable due to the constraints. The goal is to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received at least as much value as any other agent from their perspective.

Here is a proposed allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent receives from their allocated items.
2. Ensure that each agent receives a roughly equal share of the total value according to their own valuations.
3. Adjust allocations to minimize envy.

After evaluating the table of valuations, here is a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 5 and 6. 
- Agent 1 has a very high valuation for item 0.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 8.
- Agent 4 has a very high valuation for item 4.

Considering these observations, the allocation can be done as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items in a way that respects the highest valuations of each agent while ensuring each agent receives a fair portion according to their preferences.
