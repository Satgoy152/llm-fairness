Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  79  90  94  81  75  12  51  65
1  10  76  24  61  58  77  91  42  88
2  59  56  70  98  89  25  14  28  55
3  16  81  32  58  21  27  32  80  72
4  43  56  81  43  84  62  44  70  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we can use a simple approach that considers each agent's valuation of the items. We'll use a round-robin method to distribute the items based on the highest valuations first, ensuring that we meet the requirement of allocating all 9 items. 

The goal is to distribute items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation relative to others, minimizing envy. However, since this is a discrete problem with integer allocations, perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable, but we will attempt to make the distribution as fair as possible.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. List each agent's valuations for each item.
2. Sort the items for each agent by their valuations in descending order.
3. Use a round-robin mechanism to allocate items, starting with the agent who values an item the most and moving to the next highest remaining valuation.

Performing this allocation:

- Agent 0 values Item 3 the most (value = 94).
- Agent 2 values Item 3 second most (value = 98).
- Agent 4 values Item 8 the most (value = 96).
- Agent 1 values Item 8 second most (value = 88).
- Agent 0 values Item 2 third most (value = 90).
- Agent 3 values Item 1 the most (value = 81).
- Agent 1 values Item 1 second most (value = 76).
- Agent 4 values Item 4 the second most (value = 84).
- Agent 2 values Item 4 third most (value = 89).

Following this strategy, we end up with the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [8],
    "5": [5],
    "6": [6],
    "7": [0],
    "8": [2]
}
```

Note: The allocation above ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most among the remaining items, after considering the round-robin sequence. Each agent may not receive the same number of items due to the limited number of items and the constraint that each item can only be allocated once.
