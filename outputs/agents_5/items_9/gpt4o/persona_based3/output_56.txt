Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  94  54  39  90  54  70  15  42
1  88  57  60  15  55  21  92  98  63
2  20  36  26  83  27  49  67  91  87
3   3  51   0  36  55  58  78  75  80
4  90  16   7  49  15  85  15  74  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve a division that is as envy-free as possible, considering the valuations each agent has for the items. Given the constraint that each agent receives an integer number of items, we will attempt to distribute the 9 items among the 5 agents based on their preferences.

To achieve this, we'll consider the valuations and try to ensure each agent gets a collection of items that maximizes their individual valuations while attempting to minimize envy.

Here's a possible allocation of the items:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 1 highly (94), so we allocate item 1 to this agent. Also, item 4 is valuable (90).
- **Agent 1:** Values item 7 highly (98), so we allocate item 7 to this agent. Item 6 also has a high value (92).
- **Agent 2:** Values item 8 highly (87), so we allocate item 8 to this agent. Item 3 also has a high value (83).
- **Agent 3:** Values item 6 highly (78), but it's already allocated. We'll give item 5 (58) since it's the next best.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 0 highly (90), so we allocate item 0 to this agent. Item 5 has a reasonable value (85), but it's already allocated.

After this first round, reevaluate to fill in any gaps and ensure all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0:** Gets items 1, 4
- **Agent 1:** Gets items 7, 6
- **Agent 2:** Gets items 8, 3
- **Agent 3:** Gets item 5
- **Agent 4:** Gets item 0, 2

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and we try to balance the perceived fairness by considering each agent's highest preferences.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [8, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
