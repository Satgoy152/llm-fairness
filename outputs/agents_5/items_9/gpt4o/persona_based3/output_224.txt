Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  24  36  87  53  60  17  58  96
1   8  34  83  95  21  51  81  69  21
2  74  29  76  53   8  32  68  98  65
3  69  39  99  63  63  51  26  64  42
4  20  85  51  30  99  53  61  30   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we will aim for an allocation that minimizes envy among the agents. A common approach is to use an envy-free method such as the "Adjusted Winner" or "Round Robin" method. In this case, due to the limited number of items and agents, we'll use a heuristic approach to ensure each agent is fairly satisfied based on their valuations.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:** For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. **Assign Items to Agents:** Allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation for it.
3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:** Adjust in cases where agents receive no items, ensuring every item is allocated while trying to maintain fairness.

### Allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 0 values it the most (77).
2. **Item 1:** Agent 4 values it the most (85).
3. **Item 2:** Agent 3 values it the most (99).
4. **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it the most (95).
5. **Item 4:** Agent 4 values it the most (99).
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the most (60).
7. **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it the most (81).
8. **Item 7:** Agent 2 values it the most (98).
9. **Item 8:** Agent 0 values it the most (96).

### Adjustments:
- Ensure each agent receives at least one item by re-evaluating low-value assignments where necessary and considering the next highest valuation.

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5, 8],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to minimize envy by assigning each item to an agent who highly values it, while also ensuring each agent receives at least one item when possible.
