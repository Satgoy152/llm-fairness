Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  87  50   8  14  40   3  13   8
1  47  27  39  22  12  50  41  36  62
2  55  86  93  75  19  96  50   8  63
3  83  44  82   2  25   1  52  80   0
4  58  91  72  76   7  79   3  53  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the five agents, we'll strive for an envy-free allocation as much as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has relatively low valuations compared to other agents. To ensure some level of satisfaction, we will assign them items they value highest or moderately.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 8. To maximize their satisfaction, we should prioritize their highest valued items.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 and very high values for item 2 and item 3. Assigning these items should satisfy them.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 0 and item 2. Assigning these high-value items to them should be efficient.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values items 1 and 4 highly. Assigning these items to agent 4 will be beneficial.

Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0]. Agent 0 values item 0 reasonably well compared to others.
  
- **Agent 1**: Items [8, 6]. Agent 1 values item 8 the highest and values item 6 moderately.

- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 2]. Agent 2 values these items the highest.

- **Agent 3**: Items [7]. There are limited options for Agent 3 to get their highly valued items, but they are also assigned item 7, which is one of the remaining items.

- **Agent 4**: Items [1, 3, 4]. Agent 4 has high valuations for these items, ensuring they are satisfied.

This allocation attempts to balance the individual preferences of each agent while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
