Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  55  56  58  10   7  15  90  50
1  43  86  15  59  40   7  37  99  69
2  53  91  55   0  67  94  77  28  12
3  81  46  17   0  30  95  51  85  59
4  36  83  52  29  89   5  25  59  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we should aim to balance the total valuation each agent receives. This involves considering the agents' valuations of each item and attempting to distribute them so that each agent feels satisfied with their share compared to others.

Given the table of valuations, we can approach the problem as follows:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:** First, compute the total valuation of all items for each agent. This helps us understand how much value each agent places on the entire set of items.
   
2. **Initial Allocation:** Start by allocating the highest-valued items to each agent, ensuring that each item is only allocated once. This helps in maximizing each agent's satisfaction initially.

3. **Iterative Adjustment:** Adjust allocations by swapping items between agents to improve fairness. This may involve reassigning items to balance the total valuation among agents.

4. **Final Allocation:** Ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent has at least some items, if possible.

Following this strategy, here is a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0: Valuations are highest for items 1, 2, and 3. Start by allocating item 3.
2. Agent 1: Highest valuation for item 1. Allocate item 1.
3. Agent 2: Highest valuation for item 5. Allocate item 5.
4. Agent 3: Highest valuation for item 7. Allocate item 7.
5. Agent 4: Highest valuation for item 4. Allocate item 4.

Now, distribute the remaining items (0, 2, 6, 8) to balance the overall valuation:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.

This distribution considers both the fairness and the agents' highest preferences. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This distribution aims to balance the value each agent receives and ensures that all 9 items are allocated.
