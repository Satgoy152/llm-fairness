Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  97  20  79  59  38  57   4  90
1  69  65  43  50  43   6  42  81  52
2  20  43  99  67  45  97  34  67  84
3  84  89  32  48  10  68  80  88   1
4  87  50  55  36  11   9  28   7  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we will use a heuristic approach. We try to ensure each agent receives items that maximize their utility, subject to the constraint that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items. 

Given there are 5 agents and 9 items, we aim to distribute the items such that three agents receive 2 items each and two agents receive 1 item each. 

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Initial Considerations:**
   - Calculate the total value each agent places on all items and use this to guide the allocation process.
   - Try to allocate high-value items first to ensure that agents feel they are getting a fair share.

2. **Allocation Process:**
   - Begin by assigning the highest value item to the agent who values it the most, then proceed with the next highest value item, and so on.
   - Ensure that no agent receives more than 2 items at the end.

3. **Proposed Allocation:**
   - **Agent 0:** Receives items 1 and 4 (highest valued items by agent 0).
   - **Agent 1:** Receives items 0 and 7 (highest valued items by agent 1).
   - **Agent 2:** Receives items 2 and 5 (highest valued items by agent 2).
   - **Agent 3:** Receives items 6 and 3 (highest valued items by agent 3).
   - **Agent 4:** Receives item 8 (highest valued remaining item by agent 4).

By following this allocation, each agent receives items that they highly value, which helps in achieving a sense of fairness and envy-freeness.

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation distributes the 9 items across the 5 agents while attempting to respect each agent's preferences as much as possible.
