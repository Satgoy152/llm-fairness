Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  92  24   4  93  79  46  40  62
1  29  80  95  38  24  45  55  24  77
2  81  36  81   0  92  48   6   9  96
3   9  50  84  85  95  94  37  50  51
4  81  84  80  82   6  20  98  59  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuation. We must also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's first evaluate the potential allocations by considering the agents' highest valuations. This doesn't guarantee envy-freeness, but it can serve as a starting point for adjustments.

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 2 and 8.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 0 and 8.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 3, 4, and 5.
5. **Agent 4** highly values items 0, 1, 2, and 6.

A possible initial allocation considering the highest valuation items:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 4] (Total Valuation: 92 + 93 = 185)
- **Agent 1**: [2, 8] (Total Valuation: 95 + 77 = 172)
- **Agent 2**: [0] (Total Valuation: 81)
- **Agent 3**: [3, 5] (Total Valuation: 85 + 94 = 179)
- **Agent 4**: [6, 7] (Total Valuation: 98 + 59 = 157)

This allocation might not be perfect, as some agents might not be completely envy-free. To ensure all 9 items are allocated, we need to adjust and distribute them optimally.

Let's adjust the allocation for a better balance:

- **Agent 0**: [4] 
- **Agent 1**: [2]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 8]
- **Agent 3**: [3, 5]
- **Agent 4**: [1, 6, 7]

This distribution gives:

- **Agent 0**: 93
- **Agent 1**: 95
- **Agent 2**: 81 + 96 = 177
- **Agent 3**: 85 + 94 = 179
- **Agent 4**: 84 + 98 + 59 = 241

While the allocation might not be perfectly envy-free, it attempts to balance the overall value each agent receives. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1, 6, 7]
}
```
