Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  50  29  20  40  33  23  55  21
1  41  69  61  30  92  83  79  29  90
2   0  65  77  48  72  13  64  48   9
3  21  52  62  15  51  26  93  33  99
4  36  62  39  89  51  72  12  38  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents in a way that strives for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is as satisfied as possible. One common approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining pool. Another approach is to use the "maximum envy-free allocation," which directly attempts to minimize envy, but this is computationally more complex.

For simplicity and practicality, let's use a round-robin approach where each agent picks their highest-valued item that hasn't been taken by another agent. This won't guarantee perfect envy-freeness but should lead to a fair distribution given the constraints.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process based on the given valuations:

1. Each agent selects their most valued available item in turn, starting from Agent 0 to Agent 4 and repeating until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this method:

1. **Agent 0**: Picks item 0 (value 99).
2. **Agent 1**: Picks item 4 (value 92).
3. **Agent 2**: Picks item 2 (value 77).
4. **Agent 3**: Picks item 8 (value 99).
5. **Agent 4**: Picks item 3 (value 89).

Now, repeat the process with the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0**: Picks item 1 (value 50).
7. **Agent 1**: Picks item 5 (value 83).
8. **Agent 2**: Picks item 6 (value 64).
9. **Agent 3**: Picks item 7 (value 33).

Agent 4 doesn't get another pick as all items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [8, 7],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences, though it may not be completely envy-free. However, it respects the constraint of integer item allocations per agent.
