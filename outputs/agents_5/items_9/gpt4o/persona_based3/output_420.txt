Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15   1  38  38  67  66  90  11  51
1  86  71  20  81  81  92  65  83  65
2  79  47  98  75  20  20  16  13   4
3  10  24  10  53  23  27  32  99  72
4  98  68  20  70  86  41  92  12  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent is satisfied with their share according to their valuations. We will utilize a heuristic approach that attempts to minimize envy by giving items to agents that value them highly. 

Let's analyze the valuations and proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 6 (90), 5 (66), 4 (67).
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations for items 0 (86), 5 (92), 3 (81), 4 (81).
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations for items 2 (98), 0 (79), 3 (75).
4. **Agent 3**: High valuations for items 7 (99), 8 (72).
5. **Agent 4**: High valuations for items 0 (98), 6 (92), 4 (86).

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (98). Allocate to Agent 4.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (71). Allocate to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (98). Allocate to Agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (81). Allocate to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (67). Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (92). Allocate to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (90). Allocate to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (99). Allocate to Agent 3.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (72). Allocate to Agent 3.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, reducing the potential for envy. Each agent receives at least one item where feasible, and all items are allocated.
