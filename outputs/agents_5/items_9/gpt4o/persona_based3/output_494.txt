Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87   4   1  50   8  56  58   3  25
1   9  47  42  15  93  18  36  64  86
2  53  20  64  83  39  48  23  28  33
3  68  19  75  13  73  96  17  46  48
4  98  20  62  20  36  70   7  15  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we aim to assign items such that the envy among agents is minimized. One possible approach is to use the "Envy-Free" algorithm, which seeks to ensure that no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own. Given the valuations, let's proceed with a proposed allocation.

First, we will calculate the total value for each agent and attempt to distribute the items in a way that approximates these values as closely as possible while respecting the integer nature of item counts.

### Steps for Allocation:
1. **Calculate the total value for each agent** across all items.
2. **Distribute items** in a way that each agent receives a fair share of their total valuation.
3. Ensure the allocation is envy-free as much as possible.

### Allocation Process:
- Compute the sum of valuations for each agent.
- Assign items based on decreasing order of value for each agent while keeping track of the total number of items and ensuring each agent receives a fair share.

### Proposed Allocation:
Following these steps and considering the integer constraint, we have:

- **Agent 0** values item 0 the most, followed by item 3. Assign these items to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 4 the most, followed by item 8. Assign these items to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the most, already taken. Assign items 2 and 5, which are next highest.
- **Agent 3** values item 5 the most, followed by item 2. Assign item 5 and item 7.
- **Agent 4** values item 0 the most, already taken. Assign items 1 and 8.

### Final Allocation:
The allocations are balanced by ensuring each agent gets items according to their valuations while minimizing envy.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 9 items, ensuring each agent receives items based on their preferences and balancing the envy as much as possible given the constraints.
