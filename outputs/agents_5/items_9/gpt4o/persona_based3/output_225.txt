Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  40  13  72  56  15  40  78  76
1  44  63  76   3  98  48  89  43   2
2  17  24  65  64  11   4  34  18  42
3  65  96   5  56  59  99  21  54  12
4   1  97  58   3  39  20  66  11  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation based on their own valuations.

Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. There may be multiple ways to achieve this, but I'll demonstrate one possible fair allocation strategy.

To achieve an envy-free allocation, we can use a round-robin process or an iterative approach where each agent picks the most valued item available to them in turns. However, this is often complex and might not always lead to an envy-free allocation due to the discrete nature of the problem.

Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items, then allocate items prioritizing higher individual item valuations for each agent.

2. Use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation for unallocated items, iterating over the agents.

Based on this, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 7
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 6
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 3
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 5
- Agent 4 gets items 0 and 8

Now, let's format this allocation into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [0, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent gets items of high individual value to them, aiming for a fair distribution based on their preferences. Note that achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, especially with a small number of items and agents.
