Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  13  37  14  16  29  62  24  48
1  49  43  51  76  64  64  86  77  37
2  46  22  41  22  19  40  86  77  29
3  31  54  11  19  66  40   3  95  34
4   0  16  69  14  32  63  25  70  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we'll aim to satisfy the concept of envy-freeness as much as possible. Envy-freeness means that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuation. Given that we're working with integer allocations, perfect envy-freeness might not be achievable, but we can still strive for a fair allocation.

One approach to a fair division problem like this is to use a method such as the "round-robin" allocation, where agents take turns picking their most valued item from the remaining items. However, given that we have specific valuations, we can attempt to allocate items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items accordingly, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. We will try to minimize envy by ensuring that no agent would prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 5] (Total value: 66)
- Agent 1: [3, 4] (Total value: 140)
- Agent 2: [0, 1] (Total value: 68)
- Agent 3: [7] (Total value: 95)
- Agent 4: [6, 8] (Total value: 117)

Each agent receives a selection of items that, according to their valuations, aim to balance the perceived value. The allocations are made considering the highest values each agent has for certain items, while ensuring each agent receives items that sum up to a reasonable total value compared to others.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6, 8]
}
```
