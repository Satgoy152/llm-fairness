Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  95  62  45  80   4  76  56  71
1  30  18   0  33   1  42  91  42  42
2  21  54  56  80  74  65  40  66  17
3  17  54  46  16  57  86  13  16  48
4   2  12  98  20  21  60  12  64  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider their valuations and attempt to achieve a fair division that minimizes envy. A common approach is to use the "maximin" method, where each agent receives the bundle of items that maximizes their minimum value, thereby ensuring that all agents are treated fairly based on their valuations.

Here is a possible allocation that attempts to satisfy fair division criteria as best as possible:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items: 0, 1, and 4. Assign them these items.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 6 the most. Assign them item 6.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items: 3 and 7. Assign them these items.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent has a higher valuation for item 5. Assign them item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 2 the most. Assign them item 2. Assign them item 8 as well since it is not highly valued by others.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one of their higher-valued items, and all items are distributed among the agents. This approach aims to minimize envy by allocating the most valued items to each agent based on their individual rankings.
