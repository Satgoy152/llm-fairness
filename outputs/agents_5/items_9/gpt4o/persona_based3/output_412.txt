Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  31  58  61  77  27  40  87  58
1  11  83  95  95  41  57   5  34  89
2  22  70  65   2   3  68  29  17  13
3   9  59  32  80  52  82  86  21  36
4  51  21  99  38  45  24  37  95  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we aim to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation to be at least as good as any other agent's allocation from their own perspective. Given the valuations matrix, a suitable approach might involve maximizing each agent's total perceived value of their allocation while ensuring all items are allocated.

One possible way is to allocate items iteratively, selecting the item-agent pair that maximizes the agent's valuation of the item while considering the items already allocated to others. This method helps ensure that each agent receives items they value, reducing potential envy.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 0 with a valuation of 98. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 2 with a valuation of 95. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 5 with a valuation of 68. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 6 with a valuation of 86. Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is item 2 with a valuation of 99, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 7 with a valuation of 95. Allocate item 7 to Agent 4.

Continuing this process while ensuring no item is allocated more than once:

6. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - Item 1: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 1 with 83, allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 3: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 1 with 95, allocate to Agent 1.
   - Item 4: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 0 with 77, allocate to Agent 0.
   - Item 8: Highest remaining valuation is by Agent 1 with 89, allocate to Agent 1.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 2, 3, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly and that all items are distributed among the agents.
