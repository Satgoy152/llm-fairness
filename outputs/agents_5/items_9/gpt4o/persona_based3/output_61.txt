Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  53  37  91   5  35  98   0  74
1  80  39  25  22  63  69  70  52  83
2  95  58  33  42  73  29  68  48  44
3  42  12  34  31  37  53  48  52  86
4  16  14  95  59  90  70  97  88  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among agents with the aim of minimizing envy, we need to carefully consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to ensure that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. Below is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 19 + 53 + 37 + 91 + 5 + 35 + 98 + 0 + 74 = 412
   - Agent 1: 80 + 39 + 25 + 22 + 63 + 69 + 70 + 52 + 83 = 503
   - Agent 2: 95 + 58 + 33 + 42 + 73 + 29 + 68 + 48 + 44 = 490
   - Agent 3: 42 + 12 + 34 + 31 + 37 + 53 + 48 + 52 + 86 = 395
   - Agent 4: 16 + 14 + 95 + 59 + 90 + 70 + 97 + 88 + 50 = 579

2. **Initial Fair Share Calculation:**
   - Total value of all items = 2379
   - Fair share per agent if divided equally by total value = 2379 / 5 = 475.8

3. **Allocate Items:**
   - We will attempt to allocate items so each agent is as close to their fair share as possible, starting with items that are of the highest value to each agent.

4. **Allocation Process:**
   - **Agent 0:**
     - Highest value items: 6 (98), 3 (91), 8 (74)
     - Total value allocated = 98 + 91 + 74 = 263

   - **Agent 1:**
     - Highest value items: 0 (80), 8 (83)
     - Total value allocated = 80 + 83 = 163

   - **Agent 2:**
     - Highest value items: 0 (95), 4 (73)
     - Total value allocated = 95 + 73 = 168

   - **Agent 3:**
     - Highest value items: 8 (86), 5 (53)
     - Total value allocated = 86 + 53 = 139

   - **Agent 4:**
     - Highest value items: 6 (97), 4 (90), 2 (95)
     - Total value allocated = 97 + 90 + 95 = 282

5. **Adjusting Allocations to Ensure No Overlap and All Items are Allocated:**
   - Re-assign items to ensure no conflicts and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Each agent gets a reasonable portion of their preferred items based on their highest valuations.
- All 9 items are allocated without overlap, and each agent gets a positive allocation.
