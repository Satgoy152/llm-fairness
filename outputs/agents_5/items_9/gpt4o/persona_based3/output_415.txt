Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  35  53  68  70  63  67  64   0
1  70  29  57  56  60  71  78  79  94
2   0  97  85  16  66  73  68  25   9
3   4  46  82  37  44   3  11  94  75
4  70  20  89  36  58  11  26  86  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a bundle they value highly while also trying to minimize envy among the agents. Given the valuations, one approach is to use a round-robin or a sequential allocation method based on each agent's highest value for remaining items.

Let's consider the allocation process:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 4.
2. Agent 1 values item 8 the most.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 1.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the most.
5. Agent 4 also values item 8 the most, but it is already taken, so their next highest is item 2.

Let's allocate the items using a sequential method where each agent picks one item at a time based on their highest remaining valuation:

- Round 1:
  - Agent 0 selects item 4 (value 70).
  - Agent 1 selects item 8 (value 94).
  - Agent 2 selects item 1 (value 97).
  - Agent 3 selects item 7 (value 94).
  - Agent 4 selects item 2 (value 89).

- Round 2:
  - Agent 0's next highest is item 6 (value 67).
  - Agent 1's next highest is item 6 (value 78), but it is already taken, so they choose item 5 (value 71).
  - Agent 2's next highest is item 5 (value 73), but it is taken, so they choose item 6 (value 68).
  - Agent 3's next highest is item 3 (value 37).
  - Agent 4's next highest is item 0 (value 70).

After these two rounds, all items are allocated. Here is the fair division allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [8, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7, 3],
    "4": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value relatively highly, and all 9 items are distributed.
