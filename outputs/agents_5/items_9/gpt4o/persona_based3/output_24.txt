Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  57  98  12  42  24  91  31   9
1  66  55  66  55  54  37  19  65  58
2  49  63  31  63  84  65   6  90  29
3  71  96   4   9  49  70  63  15   1
4  16  26  60  46  37  12  39  22  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to find a distribution where each agent receives a bundle of items that minimizes envy. One common approach is to use the "Envy-Free Up to One Item" (EF1) criterion, which allows for some flexibility in achieving practical fairness.

Given the valuations provided, let us attempt a balanced allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (98), Item 6 (91)
   - Allocate: Item 2, Item 6

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 0 (66), Item 1 (55)
   - Allocate: Item 0, Item 1

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 4 (84), Item 7 (90)
   - Allocate: Item 4, Item 7

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 1 (96), Item 5 (70)
   - Allocate: Item 5

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (60), Item 3 (46)
   - Allocate: Item 3, Item 8

Let's verify the allocation to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 7]
- Agent 3: Item [5]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 8]

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives a bundle that closely matches their highest valuations while maintaining a fair distribution.

Now, we present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 8]
}
```
