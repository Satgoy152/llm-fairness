Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  27  48  72  76  52  33  43  82
1  49  72  26  40  12   2   3   2   2
2  81   1  21  83  19  24  97  45  50
3  95  62   4   9   2  46  40  34  70
4  82   1  13  68  22  75   7  17  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents while considering envy-freeness and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use an approach that prioritizes items based on their valuations by each agent. The objective is to minimize envy by ensuring agents receive items they value highly compared to others.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valued Items per Agent**: Check which items have the highest relative value for each agent compared to other agents.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Start allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent ends up with a fair share.

3. **Adjust for Leftover Items**: If any items remain unallocated, assign them to agents in a way that maintains fairness and minimizes envy.

After applying this approach, the allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the most, followed by item 4.
- Agent 1 has a relatively high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 6.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most.
- Agent 4 has a relatively high valuation for item 5.

Following this logic, here is a fair allocation of the items:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [5, 7, 2]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest valued items, ensuring that each agent receives items they value relatively more, while fairly distributing the total of 9 items.
