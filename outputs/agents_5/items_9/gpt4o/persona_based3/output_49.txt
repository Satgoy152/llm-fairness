Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  60  99  29  95  16  38  98  27
1  82   6  67  57  39   0  52  86  17
2  93  47  33  94  81  41  55   5  98
3  68  43  75  58  79  61  43  82   3
4  96  93  43  86  47  58  90  56  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and fair division, we can use a greedy allocation method. This method involves iteratively assigning each item to the agent who values it the most and hasn't yet received a fair share. The goal is to distribute the total value as evenly as possible across all agents.

### Step-by-Step Allocation Process

1. **Calculate Total Value and Fair Share:**
   - Compute the total value of all items for each agent and determine the fair share. The fair share for an agent is the total value of all items divided by the number of agents.

2. **Greedy Allocation:**
   - Iterate over each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that the distribution remains close to the fair share.

3. **Check for Envy-Freeness:**
   - After allocation, verify that no agent envies another agent's allocation.

### Allocation

Based on the table provided, here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Initial Total Values:**
   - Agent 0: 549
   - Agent 1: 406
   - Agent 2: 547
   - Agent 3: 512
   - Agent 4: 658

2. **Fair Share:**
   - Total Value = 2672
   - Fair Share for each agent = Total Value / Number of Agents = 2672 / 5 â‰ˆ 534.4

3. **Assign Items:**
   - Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation while attempting to meet or get close to the fair share.

### Allocation Plan

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

### Explanation

- **Agent 0** receives items [0, 4]: Value = 87 + 95 = 182
- **Agent 1** receives items [3, 6]: Value = 57 + 52 = 109
- **Agent 2** receives items [2, 8]: Value = 33 + 98 = 131
- **Agent 3** receives item [7]: Value = 82
- **Agent 4** receives items [1, 5]: Value = 93 + 58 = 151

This allocation is constructed to balance each agent's share of the total value as evenly as possible, given their preferences.
