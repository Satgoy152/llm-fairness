Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  36  45  72  27  82  94  35  70
1  85  14  40  73  31   0  18   3  54
2  68   2  83  48  79  32   9   0  18
3  44   8  55  83  53  63  41  25  25
4  39  80  68  77  25   6  52  19  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we'll aim for an envy-free division, where each agent values their allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. However, with integer allocations and discrete items, full envy-freeness might not always be possible. We'll aim to minimize envy as much as possible while ensuring every agent receives at least one item. Here's one approach to achieving a fair distribution:

1. **Initial Allocation Strategy:**
   - Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
   - Assign items sequentially to the agent who values them the most, ensuring no agent gets more than necessary to maintain balance.

2. **Iterative Adjustments:**
   - After initial allocation, check for potential envy and reallocate items if necessary to minimize it.

3. **Allocation:**
   - The goal is to ensure each agent has a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's a proposed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [1, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's preferences and attempts to evenly distribute the total perceived value of items among the agents. Note that achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations might not be possible, but this distribution seeks to minimize envy as much as possible given the constraints.
