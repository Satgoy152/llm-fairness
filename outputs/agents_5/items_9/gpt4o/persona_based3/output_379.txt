Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  91  95  85  45  50  75  42  37
1  14  13  84  59  87  34  46  70   7
2  21  31  74  19  19  71  22  89   5
3  97   2  11  82   7  10  91  33  12
4  40  47  41   7   4  12  32   0  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, it's essential to balance the allocation so that each agent perceives their bundle as at least as valuable as any other agent's bundle. Given the valuations, we can proceed with a strategy to distribute the items.

Let's consider the valuations and aim for a fair distribution:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, and 3. Assign item 0 (60) and item 2 (95) to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 (87) the highest. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 7 (89) the highest. Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 (97) the highest, but item 0 is already assigned. Assign item 3 (82) and item 6 (91) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 (47) the highest. Assign item 1 and item 8 (43) to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, while also distributing the items fairly based on their preferences.

The final allocation in the specified JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1, 8]
}
```
