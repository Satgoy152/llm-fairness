Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37   0  26  93  24  19  20  92   3
1  98  48  52  41   5  30  21  24  54
2  65  94   9  39  15  82   3  66  56
3  32  26   1  10  32   5  76  21  92
4  64  24  34  95  49  86  77  34   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while maintaining envy-freeness, we can use an approach like the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method. This method can help distribute items based on each agent's preferences, reducing the likelihood of envy.

### Sequential Allocation Strategy:

1. **Round 1 (Highest Value Picks):**
   - Agent 0 picks item 3 (value 93).
   - Agent 1 picks item 0 (value 98).
   - Agent 2 picks item 1 (value 94).
   - Agent 3 picks item 8 (value 92).
   - Agent 4 picks item 3 (value 95), but since it's already taken, they pick item 5 (value 86) next best available.

2. **Round 2 (Next Best Picks):**
   - Agent 0 picks item 7 (value 92).
   - Agent 1 picks item 2 (value 52).
   - Agent 2 picks item 7 (value 66), but since it's taken, they pick item 5 (value 82), but it's taken, they pick item 8 (value 56).
   - Agent 3 picks item 6 (value 76).
   - Agent 4 picks item 4 (value 49).

3. **Round 3 (Final Picks):**
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 26), but it's taken, they pick item 6 (value 20), but it's taken, they pick item 0 (value 37), but it's taken, they pick item 4 (value 24), but it's taken, they pick item 1 (value 0).
   - Agent 1 picks item 4 (value 5), but it's taken, they pick item 6 (value 21), but it's taken, they pick item 8 (value 54), but it's taken, they pick item 7 (value 24), but it's taken, they pick item 5 (value 30), but it's taken, they pick item 3 (value 41), but it's taken, they pick item 1 (value 48), but it's taken, they pick item 6 (value 21), but it's taken.
   - Agent 2 picks item 3 (value 39), but it's taken, they pick item 6 (value 3), but it's taken, they pick item 5 (value 82), but it's taken, they pick item 2 (value 9), but it's taken, they pick item 4 (value 15), but it's taken, they pick item 0 (value 65).
   - Agent 3 picks item 2 (value 1), but it's taken, they pick item 0 (value 32).
   - Agent 4 picks item 2 (value 34), but it's taken, they pick item 1 (value 24), but it's taken, they pick item 6 (value 77), but it's taken, they pick item 0 (value 64), but it's taken, they pick item 7 (value 34).

This allocation ensures every agent gets a fair share based on their preferences and every agent receives at least one item.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation provides a balanced distribution of item values while considering each agent's preferences as much as possible given the constraints of the problem.
