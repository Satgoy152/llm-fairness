Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86   6  96  49   9  55  51  34  11
1  59   0  32   1  14   5  94  34  77
2  82  48  28  88  82  64  14  99  22
3  26  88  44  36  22  51  18  14  42
4  62  70  51  85  83  90  25  54  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will try to achieve an allocation that is closest to being envy-free. An envy-free allocation means that no agent prefers the bundle of items assigned to another agent over their own bundle. Although achieving complete envy-freeness in this situation may not be possible due to the discrete nature of items and differing valuations, we will aim to minimize envy.

We have 5 agents and 9 items. We can start by trying to allocate the items in a way that equalizes the perceived value as much as possible. Let's analyze the valuations and perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value items are 2 (96) and 0 (86).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value items are 6 (94) and 8 (77).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value items are 7 (99) and 3 (88).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value items are 1 (88) and 2 (44).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value items are 5 (90) and 4 (83).

Now, let's allocate items trying to match these preferences while ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0: Assign items 2 and 0 (value: 96 + 86 = 182).
- Agent 1: Assign items 6 and 8 (value: 94 + 77 = 171).
- Agent 2: Assign items 7 and 3 (value: 99 + 88 = 187).
- Agent 3: Assign item 1 (value: 88).
- Agent 4: Assign items 5 and 4 (value: 90 + 83 = 173).

Now, we have allocated all 9 items. Let's ensure that this allocation is balanced in terms of preference:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 0]
- Agent 1: Items [6, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [7, 3]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 4: Items [5, 4]

This allocation respects the highest valuations of each agent while ensuring each gets a reasonable portion of their preferred items. Let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences, with an attempt to minimize envy.
