Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5   9  56  40  70  48   4  62  92
1  88  62  52  88  95  66  42   8  59
2  52  58  61  99  48  22   7   9   6
3  69  65  18  95  27  79  95  12  12
4  45  77  34  46  32  50  73   0  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for an envy-free division, we can use techniques that consider both the valuations of each agent and the necessity to allocate all items. Given the complexity and the specific constraints of the problem, one approach is to use a round-robin allocation based on the highest valuation to each agent, ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's perform an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 8 (value 92).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 4 (value 95).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 3 (value 99).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 6 (value 95).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 1 (value 77).

After the first round of allocation, we have:
- Agent 0 gets item 8.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.

Now, allocate the remaining items [0, 2, 5, 7] through a similar process:

6. **Agent 0**: Next highest value is for item 7 (value 62).
7. **Agent 1**: Next highest value is for item 0 (value 88).
8. **Agent 2**: Next highest value is for item 2 (value 61).
9. **Agent 3**: Next highest value is for item 5 (value 79).

Now, the final allocation is:

- Agent 0 gets items [8, 7].
- Agent 1 gets items [4, 0].
- Agent 2 gets items [3, 2].
- Agent 3 gets items [6, 5].
- Agent 4 gets item [1].

The allocations in the requested JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 7],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [6, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
