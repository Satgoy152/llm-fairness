Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  58  59  59   1  82  21  66  64
1  76  84  89  86  37  68  32  85  57
2  10  85  84  81  47  23  65  44  89
3  36  91  64  35  40  61  13  75  33
4  58  32   7  82  61   3   7  14  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we should aim to minimize envy, where each agent feels satisfied with their assigned set of items. We can use the method of maximizing the sum of valuations across all allocations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items and aim to give each agent items that maximize this total for them.
2. Use a greedy approach to assign items, starting with the agent that values their top choice the most, then move to the next agent, and so on.
3. Adjust to ensure that all items are allocated and that no agent feels particularly envious of another's allocation.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 and 7.
- Agent 1 highly values item 2 and 3.
- Agent 2 highly values item 8 and 1.
- Agent 3 highly values item 1.
- Agent 4 highly values item 4.

Based on these observations, the allocation can be:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [8, 1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, every agent gets items that they value highly. Agent 3 does not receive any items, but this allocation aims to satisfy the highest possible value for each agent given the constraint of integer allocations.
