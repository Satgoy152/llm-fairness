Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  66   6  91  43  24  26  49  74
1  93  65  52  85  15  19  82   4  34
2  98  23   9   5  79  76   5  45  73
3  49  94  47  48  49   9   0  60  44
4  35  76  24  83  40  80  81   6  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that no agent feels envious of another agent's allocation. This means each agent should feel that their allocated items are as valuable as possible compared to other allocations, based on their individual valuation.

Here's one approach to consider:

1. **Identify Preferences**: Determine which items each agent values the most. This can be done by ranking the items according to each agent's valuations.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Adjust allocations to ensure that each agent has a fair share relative to their valuations.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers items 3 (91), 1 (66), and 0 (60).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 0 (93), 3 (85), and 6 (82).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers items 0 (98), 4 (79), and 5 (76).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers items 1 (94), 7 (60), and 2 (47).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers items 5 (80), 6 (81), and 1 (76).

Considering these preferences, let's attempt a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 8] (Highest values are 91 and 74)
- **Agent 1**: [6, 0] (Highest values are 82 and 93)
- **Agent 2**: [4, 5] (Highest values are 79 and 76)
- **Agent 3**: [1, 7] (Highest values are 94 and 60)
- **Agent 4**: [2] (Highest value is 24)

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value while distributing the total number of items fairly.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```
