Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  54  28  84  49  92   5  30  45
1  30  24  27  15  17  80   6  37  10
2  76  46  17  39  91  54  36  84  46
3  11  71  82  16  23  98  18  69  83
4  93  41  73  19  18  68  24  16  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them in a way that each agent feels they are receiving a fair share based on their preferences. Given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all 9 items must be allocated, we'll start by examining each agent's top preferences and attempt to distribute the items accordingly.

Here's a proposed allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: They highly value item 5 (92) and item 0 (87). Assign these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: They value item 5 (80) the most, however, it's already allocated. Their next highest valued item is item 7 (37). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: They highly value item 4 (91) and item 7 (84). Since item 7 is already allocated, assign item 4 to Agent 2. Their next highest valued item is item 0 (76), which is also allocated. Next is item 5 (54), which is also allocated. Assign item 1 (46) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: They most value item 5 (98), but it is already allocated. Their next highest valued items are item 8 (83) and item 2 (82). Assign item 8 and item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: They most value item 0 (93), but it's already allocated. Their next highest valued items are item 2 (73) and item 5 (68), both of which are allocated. Assign item 3 (19) and item 6 (24) to Agent 4.

By allocating items in this way, each agent receives at least one item, and we've distributed all 9 items such that each agent should feel they received a relatively fair share based on their individual valuations.

Allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [8, 2],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```
