Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  50  43  93  82  29  21  63   7
1  47  17  40  70  57  37  15  66  50
2  81  11  22  63  88  18   5  65  13
3   6  16  75   4   9  24  27  89  17
4  95  47  25  75  62  18  72  78   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness as much as possible, where each agent gets a fair share of items based on their own valuations. 

One approach to achieve this is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that hasn't been allocated yet. This method helps in ensuring that each agent gets items they value highly.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 4**: Picks item 0 (value 95)
2. **Agent 2**: Picks item 4 (value 88)
3. **Agent 0**: Picks item 3 (value 93)
4. **Agent 3**: Picks item 7 (value 89)
5. **Agent 1**: Picks item 3 (value 70) [already taken, pick next highest available]
6. **Agent 1**: Picks item 8 (value 50)
7. **Agent 0**: Picks item 1 (value 50)
8. **Agent 2**: Picks item 7 (value 65) [already taken, pick next highest available]
9. **Agent 2**: Picks item 1 (value 11) [already taken, pick next highest available]
10. **Agent 2**: Picks item 5 (value 18)
11. **Agent 3**: Picks item 2 (value 75)
12. **Agent 4**: Picks item 7 (value 78) [already taken, pick next highest available]
13. **Agent 4**: Picks item 3 (value 75) [already taken, pick next highest available]
14. **Agent 4**: Picks item 1 (value 47) [already taken, pick next highest available]
15. **Agent 4**: Picks item 6 (value 72)
16. **Agent 0**: Picks item 2 (value 43) [already taken, pick next highest available]
17. **Agent 0**: Picks item 4 (value 82) [already taken, pick next highest available]
18. **Agent 0**: Picks item 5 (value 29) [already taken, pick next highest available]
19. **Agent 0**: Picks item 8 (value 7) [already taken, pick next highest available]
20. **Agent 0**: Picks item 6 (value 21) [already taken, pick next highest available]

Given the above selections, let's adjust the allocations to ensure all items are distributed:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 1, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [8]
- **Agent 2**: [4]
- **Agent 3**: [2, 7]
- **Agent 4**: [3, 6]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```
