Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  13  94  64  72  55   8  80  82
1  29  76  96  73  50  86   0  43  91
2  76  82  35  47  40   4  96  13   2
3  66  77  69  10  94  84  30  76  44
4  22  28   8  35  41  26  81  97   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we need to distribute the items such that the allocation is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible given the constraints. An envy-free allocation implies that no agent should desire the allocation of another agent based on their personal valuations.

Given the valuations, a fair allocation would attempt to balance the values each agent receives. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values the items highly in general, particularly items 2 and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high value for item 2, 5, and 8.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 0 and item 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Places high value on item 4 and item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: Has a high value for item 7.

Following a simplified procedure to ensure each agent receives at least one item and to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes each agent's total value, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 8]
- **Agent 1**: [3, 5]
- **Agent 2**: [0, 6]
- **Agent 3**: [4]
- **Agent 4**: [1, 7]

This distribution attempts to balance the total value that each agent receives based on their preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Now, presenting the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations, while all items are distributed among the agents.
