Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10   6  16  76  48  69  55  82  21
1  48  68  29  49  21  30   1  15   0
2  53  95  57  91   9  56  47  72  11
3  87  17  44   8  92  49  54   4  15
4  61  89  88  13   0  65  47  74  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while minimizing envy, we can use a strategy that considers each agent's valuation of the items. One approach is to use an algorithm based on maximizing the Nash Social Welfare, which often leads to envy-free allocations.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can achieve this:

1. **Sort Items by Valuation**: Look at the items and see which agents value them the most.

2. **Allocate Items**: Allocate items to agents based on a combination of their highest valuations and ensuring that each agent gets a fair share.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: After an initial allocation, make adjustments to minimize envy.

Let's perform a manual allocation:

- **Agent 0** highly values item 7 (value 82) and item 3 (value 76).
- **Agent 1** has high valuations for item 1 (value 68) and item 0 (value 48).
- **Agent 2** values item 1 the most (value 95) and item 3 (value 91).
- **Agent 3** values item 0 the most (value 87) and item 4 (value 92).
- **Agent 4** highly values item 1 (value 89) and item 2 (value 88).

Given these preferences, an allocation that attempts to balance envy and fairness could be:

- **Agent 0**: [7, 5]
- **Agent 1**: [0, 4]
- **Agent 2**: [1, 3]
- **Agent 3**: [6]
- **Agent 4**: [2, 8]

This allocation considers high valuations while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of valuable items.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents.
