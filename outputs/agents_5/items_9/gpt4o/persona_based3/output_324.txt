Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  79   1  53  69  20  73  23  87
1   1  77  49  90  57  80  68  12  97
2  28  64  49  97  17  69  91   9  35
3  62  50   6  76  55  33  93  63   6
4  54  27  35  49  12  37  55  14   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy between the agents. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent would prefer the bundle of items received by another agent, given their own preferences.

The table provided gives us the valuations each agent has for every item. Our goal is to distribute the items so that the allocations are as balanced as possible based on these valuations.

Here's a possible allocation plan:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest value for item 8 (value 87). 
   - Allocate item 8 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest value for item 8 (value 97), but it's already assigned to agent 0.
   - Next highest is item 3 (value 90).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 3 highly (value 97), but it's already assigned to agent 1.
   - Next highest is item 6 (value 91).
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 6 highly (value 93), but it's already assigned to agent 2.
   - Next highest is item 0 (value 62).
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 doesn't have a high valuation for any remaining items, but item 0 has been assigned already.
   - Allocate any remaining item with reasonable value to agent 4, like item 2 (value 35).

Continuing in this manner, ensuring that each remaining item goes to an agent who hasn't already received a high-value item from another agent, we might arrive at a distribution like this:

- Item 1 to Agent 2
- Item 4 to Agent 0
- Item 5 to Agent 1
- Item 7 to Agent 3

This way, each agent gets at least one item, and we try to make sure that the value distributions are somewhat balanced.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [6, 1],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with a focus on maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while attempting to minimize envy.
