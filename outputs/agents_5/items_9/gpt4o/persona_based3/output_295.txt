Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  78  76  97  80   4  79  84  19
1  99  83  76   3  48  86  63  42  29
2  11  55  38  42  27  39  95   2  46
3  23   2  53  61  30  67  89  57  50
4  83  91  36  12  19   3  15  99  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have a fair share. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own.

One common heuristic for achieving fairness is to use a method like the "Round Robin" allocation or "Maximum Nash Welfare." Here we will adopt a straightforward approach to ensure each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.

Below is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3, 1, and 6. We assign them items 3, 1, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has a very high valuation for item 0. We assign them item 0.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 highly but it's already allocated. We give them item 5, which is their next highest.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 6 and 3, but they're already taken. We assign them items 8 and 7.
5. **Agent 4** values item 7 highly but it's already taken. We give them items 4 and 2, which are their next highest.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [8, 7],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent has been given items based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent feels they have received a fair share.
