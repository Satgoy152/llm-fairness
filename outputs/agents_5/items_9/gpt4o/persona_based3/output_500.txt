Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  98  64  90  81   5  98  87  70
1   2  61  22  18  73  36  48  33  99
2  55  48  78  26  21  95  62  52   6
3  42  10  70  30  67  39  57  58  82
4  98  26  56  48  35  63  71  78  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and accounts for each agent’s preferences. A common approach is to use the "maximum marginal valuation" strategy, where each agent is given the item they value the most, iterating through the items until all are allocated.

Here is one potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 and item 6 equally at 98, but since item 1 has the highest single valuation, allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 8 the most at 99, allocate item 8 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the most at 95, allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 4 values item 0 the most at 98, allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
5. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 (next highest value after item 1).
6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 4 (second-highest value after item 0).
7. Allocate item 2 to Agent 2 (next highest value after item 5).
8. Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value after item 8).
9. Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 (Agent 3's highest remaining value).

This allocation attempts to balance each agent’s high valuations and distribute the items fairly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [8, 4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```
