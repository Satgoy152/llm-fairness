Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  72  15  68  61  12  35  90  51
1  65  85  15  32  77  65  87  96  91
2  80  80  88  76  66  36   4  83  40
3  38  28   9   4  87  16  71   0  72
4  18  96   5  69  45  72   4  87  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair division of items among the agents, we will aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, given that envy-freeness might not be perfectly attainable in every case with discrete items. We'll also ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

The strategy involves using the concept of maximizing each agent's minimum utility and balancing the allocations across the agents' preferences. Here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [8]
- Agent 3: [4, 5]
- Agent 4: [1, 3, 6]

This allocation attempts to balance the item values based on the agents' preferences, aiming to minimize any significant envy.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [1, 3, 6]
}
```
