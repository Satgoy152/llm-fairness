Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  83  32  93  78  31  87  25  52
1  47  33  43  98  29  60  79  45  88
2  14  63  97  24  38  63  45  93  51
3  92  76  13  20  88  87  88  71  40
4  40  99   6  46   0  65  31  63  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that would be envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation means no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own, given their valuations.

The simplest way to achieve this is to ensure each agent receives approximately equal value according to their own valuations.

Let’s consider the following approach:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Assign items to agents one by one, aiming to equalize the total value each agent receives.

Here’s the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations include item 3 (93), item 6 (87), and item 1 (83).
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations include item 3 (98), item 8 (88), and item 6 (79).
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations include item 2 (97), item 7 (93), and item 1 (63).
4. **Agent 3**: High valuations include item 0 (92), item 4 (88), and item 5 (87).
5. **Agent 4**: High valuations include item 1 (99), item 8 (94), and item 5 (65).

Let's allocate based on these preferences, ensuring no overlap and that all items are allocated:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (as they value it most at 98).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (as they value it most at 97).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (as they value it most at 99).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (as they value it highly at 87).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (as they value it highly at 92).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 4 (as they value it second-highest at 94).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (as they value it second-highest at 93).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (as they value it highly at 88).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (as they value it second-highest at 60).

This distribution attempts to balance each agent's total value received according to their individual preferences.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [1, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed fairly among the 5 agents and respects their preferences as closely as possible.
