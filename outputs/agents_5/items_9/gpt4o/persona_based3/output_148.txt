Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49   5   0  53  12  61  35  63   6
1  37  33  45  73  20  69  89  54  44
2  55  73  67   2   3  10  27  61  21
3  47  23  68  38  28  92  57  39  70
4  73  81  65  31  10  98  77  10  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [55 73 67  2  3 10 27 61 21]
 [47 23 68 38 28 92 57 39 70]
 [73 81 65 31 10 98 77 10 13]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we'll attempt to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's start by analyzing the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 284
- Agent 1: 464
- Agent 2: 319
- Agent 3: 462
- Agent 4: 458

Now, we will distribute the items to approximate these valuations as closely as possible, ensuring each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: Items with higher personal value are preferable. Items 0, 3, 5, and 7 are particularly valuable to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Items 3, 5, 6, and 7 have high values.
3. **Agent 2**: Items 1, 2, and 7 are the most valuable.
4. **Agent 3**: Items 2, 5, and 8 are significant.
5. **Agent 4**: Items 0, 1, 5, and 6 hold high values.

### Proposed Allocation
- **Agent 0**: [0, 3] (Value: 49 + 53 = 102)
- **Agent 1**: [5] (Value: 69)
- **Agent 2**: [1, 7] (Value: 73 + 61 = 134)
- **Agent 3**: [2, 8] (Value: 68 + 70 = 138)
- **Agent 4**: [4, 6] (Value: 10 + 77 = 87)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that are relatively valuable to them, minimizing envy by approximating the total value each agent perceives.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
