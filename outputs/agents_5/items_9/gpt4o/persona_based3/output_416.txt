Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  89  15  33  99  92  14  86  25
1  53  74  67  91  22  79  58  58  56
2  23  25  67  36  70  41  45  30  20
3  25  93   9  49  84  65  47  25  88
4   1  26   1  96  50  60  89  13  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will consider the concept of envy-freeness, where no agent should prefer someone else's allocation over their own. However, achieving perfect envy-freeness with integer allocations may not always be possible, so we aim for a fair and balanced allocation that minimizes envy as much as possible.

The goal here is to allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents based on their valuations in a way that each agent feels they have received a fair share. 

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 because it has the highest valuation for this item (99).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 because it has the highest valuation for this item (91).
3. Assign item 8 to Agent 3 because it has the highest valuation for this item (88).
4. Assign item 6 to Agent 4 because it has the highest valuation for this item (89).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because it has a high valuation and Agent 0 has already received an item.
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 because it has the second highest valuation for this item (93).
7. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 because it has a reasonably high valuation and Agent 1 has already received an item.
8. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 because it has a reasonably high valuation and Agent 1 has already received items.
9. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 because it has a reasonably high valuation and Agent 0 has already received items.

The resulting allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and tries to respect the higher valuations of agents for specific items as much as possible, given the constraints of integer allocations.
