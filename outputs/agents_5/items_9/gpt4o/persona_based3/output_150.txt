Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  25  41  24  40  37  46  46  67
1  95  50  72  63  77   2  96  81  26
2   8  68  49  91  48   7   3  15  88
3  16  55   4  34  17  38  56  93  61
4  65  49   9   7  19  34  96  38  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One effective approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences, while also considering the overall fairness of the distribution.

Given the valuations, let's attempt to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (67), Item 6 (46), Item 7 (46)
   - Allocate: Items [6, 7]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (95), Item 6 (96)
   - Allocate: Items [0, 8]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 8 (88)
   - Allocate: Item [3]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (93), Item 8 (61)
   - Allocate: Item [1, 2]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (96), Item 0 (65)
   - Allocate: Item [4, 5]

Let's check the assignments:

- Agent 0 gets items [6, 7], total value: 46 + 46 = 92
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 8], total value: 95 + 26 = 121
- Agent 2 gets item [3], total value: 91
- Agent 3 gets items [1, 2], total value: 55 + 4 = 59
- Agent 4 gets items [4, 5], total value: 19 + 34 = 53

Now, let's represent the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents, respecting their preferences as closely as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
