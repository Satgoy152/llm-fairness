Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  77  30  12  38   1  79  97   6
1  32  79   4  62  40  26  94  20  27
2  20  55  48  92  97  97  18  32  86
3  69  70  67  67  45  37   9  26  35
4   3  55  38  61  70  57  80  62  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as anyone else's allocation based on their own valuation. Given the valuations, we can use a heuristic approach to attempt an envy-free allocation. Here's one potential way to allocate the items:

1. Sort each agent's valuation for all items in descending order.
2. Proceed by allocating items to agents based on maximizing their valuation while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the total value.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Agent 0** values item 7 the highest, so we allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest, so we allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 1 the highest, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4** values item 6 the highest, but since it's already allocated, we allocate their next highest valued item, item 6, to Agent 4 (which was actually already covered with Agent 1, so we proceed to the next highest unallocated item, item 4).

Repeat this process until all items are allocated, ensuring no duplicate allocations and that each item is only allocated once.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [7, 0] (valuations: 97, 95)
- Agent 1: [6, 3] (valuations: 94, 62)
- Agent 2: [4, 8] (valuations: 97, 86)
- Agent 3: [1] (valuations: 70)
- Agent 4: [5, 2] (valuations: 57, 38)

Now let's format the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation is done such that every agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.
