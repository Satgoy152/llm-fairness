Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  69  47  55  96  71  34  49  97
1  46  38  60  14   1  16  78   5  72
2  52  91  29  89  36  53  40   1  19
3  77  88  86  97  84  85  69  15  85
4  85  18  67  16  72  16  55  60  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's bundle of goods over their own, based on their valuations.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while considering the overall balance of the allocation to maintain fairness. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most at 85, so allocate to Agent 4.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most at 91, so allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the most at 86, so allocate to Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most at 97, so allocate to Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 96, so allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it the most at 71, so allocate to Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 1 values it the most at 78, so allocate to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it at 60, which is the highest valuation, so allocate to Agent 4.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it the most at 97, so allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, which helps in maintaining an envy-free distribution. 

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5, 8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```
