Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  79  88  40  34  66  64  12   3
1  11  21  35   8  54  48  29  42  27
2   0  85  68  85  46   5  83  49  61
3  14  16   1  66   7  67  79  56  24
4  88  39  20  30  49  10  95  59  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 5 agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel that their allocated items are at least as good as the items allocated to any other agent according to their valuation.

Let us first calculate the total valuation of all items for each agent:

- Agent 0: 71 + 79 + 88 + 40 + 34 + 66 + 64 + 12 + 3 = 457
- Agent 1: 11 + 21 + 35 + 8 + 54 + 48 + 29 + 42 + 27 = 275
- Agent 2: 0 + 85 + 68 + 85 + 46 + 5 + 83 + 49 + 61 = 482
- Agent 3: 14 + 16 + 1 + 66 + 7 + 67 + 79 + 56 + 24 = 330
- Agent 4: 88 + 39 + 20 + 30 + 49 + 10 + 95 + 59 + 54 = 444

Given that there are 9 items and 5 agents, each agent should ideally receive about 9/5 = 1.8 items each. However, we must allocate integer numbers of items, so some agents may receive 2 items while others receive 1.

Let's distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 2. To maximize their satisfaction, we allocate:
   - Items: 0, 1

2. **Agent 1** has a higher valuation for item 4. Allocating:
   - Items: 4, 7

3. **Agent 2** highly values items 1 and 3 but item 1 is already allocated. We allocate:
   - Items: 3, 6

4. **Agent 3** does not have very high valuations, but item 5 is relatively higher:
   - Item: 5

5. **Agent 4** highly values items 6 and 0, but these are already allocated. We allocate the remaining items:
   - Items: 2, 8

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 8]
}
```

This allocation considers the relative valuations of agents and aims to distribute the items fairly across all agents.
