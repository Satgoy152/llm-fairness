Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  28  80  30  68  45  72  60  11
1  74  17  79  66  86  78  83  65  50
2  31  78  21  64  60  37  26  66  43
3  59  89  37  78  50  54  43  47  27
4  85   8  45  84  50  98  67  62  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, I will use a method that aims for envy-freeness while ensuring all items are distributed. The objective is to maximize each agent's total valuation for their allocated items while ensuring no agent envies another's allocation. This is not always perfectly possible, but we strive for the best possible solution.

I'll implement a simple round-robin allocation based on maximizing individual agent's valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value items: 2 (80), 0 (76)
   - Allocate: [2, 0]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 4 (86), 6 (83)
   - Allocate: [4, 6]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 1 (78), 7 (66)
   - Allocate: [1, 7]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 3 (78)
   - Allocate: [3]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value items: 5 (98), 8 (63)
   - Allocate: [5, 8]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 8]
}
```
