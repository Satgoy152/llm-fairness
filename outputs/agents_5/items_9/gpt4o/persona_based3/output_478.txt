Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  68  68  89  16  50  46  85  89
1  63   0  66  43  74  37  90  78  18
2  69  14  51  93  80  86  66  29  89
3  66  81  49  41  90   8  89  50  88
4  50  34  96  17  89  29  44  49  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation to be at least as valuable as any other agent's allocation. While achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging, a reasonable approach is to aim for a balanced distribution of total value perceived by each agent.

Let's go through a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Item**: Determine the sum of values each agent assigns to every item. This can help us understand which items are generally more valued and should be considered carefully when allocating.

2. **Allocate High-Value Items First**: Items with high combined valuations or those highly valued by specific agents should be allocated first to maximize perceived fairness.

3. **Balance Remaining Items**: Distribute remaining items in a way that balances the total perceived value for each agent.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Initial Allocation**:
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2 (highest value for agent 2 and a generally high-value item).
   - Assign item 6 to agent 1 (highest value for agent 1 and a high-value item).
   - Assign item 4 to agent 3 (highest value for agent 3 and a high-value item).

2. **Balance Remaining Items**:
   - Assign item 7 to agent 0 (high value for agent 0).
   - Assign item 8 to agent 3 (high value for agent 3).
   - Assign item 0 to agent 2 (a moderately high value for agent 2).
   - Assign item 1 to agent 4 (balance allocation and moderately valued).
   - Assign item 2 to agent 0 (balance allocation and highly valued by agent 0).
   - Assign item 5 to agent 4 (balance allocation).

3. **Review and Adjust if Necessary**: Ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the total perceived value is balanced. Adjust if any agent's allocation is significantly less valuable.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the perceived value across agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The allocation considers items' valuations to minimize envy and optimize fairness.
