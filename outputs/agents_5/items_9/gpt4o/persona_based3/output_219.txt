Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23   8  10   4  95  54  95  27  88
1  68  94  90  33  21   3  26  25  40
2  92  27  99  86  43  64  11  86  52
3  91   2  36  96  78  38  44  61  75
4  77  65  68  44  86   9  25  63   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while trying to maintain an envy-free distribution, we need to consider each agent's valuations of the items. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. A practical approach can be the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that remains unallocated. Given the complexity of exact envy-freeness, this method balances fairness and feasibility.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valued item is 4 with a value of 95.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valued item is 1 with a value of 94.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valued item is 2 with a value of 99.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valued item is 3 with a value of 96.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valued item is 4, but it's taken, so the next is 0 with a value of 77.
6. **Agent 0**: The next highest is 6 with a value of 95.
7. **Agent 1**: The next highest is 8 with a value of 40.
8. **Agent 2**: The next highest is 5 with a value of 64.
9. **Agent 3**: The next highest is 7 with a value of 61.

Now each item is allocated, and all agents have at least one item. Let's assign this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents. It's designed to be simple yet close to fair, given the constraints and the agents' preferences.
