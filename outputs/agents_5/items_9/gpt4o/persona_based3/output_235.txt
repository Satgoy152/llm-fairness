Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  31  80  51  20   3  43  45  69
1   6  66  81   4  25  20  31  60  43
2  94  20  29   7  81  70  16  99  74
3  89  32  39  88  55  92  55  66  24
4   1  64  42   4   6  88  21  97  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while striving for envy-freeness, we can use a method like maximizing the minimum utility or minimizing the maximum envy. Given the agents' valuations of the items, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a share that they perceive as valuable.

Here's a possible allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. **Agent 0** values:
   - High valuation for item 2 (80), item 0 (48), and item 3 (51).
   
2. **Agent 1** values:
   - High valuation for item 2 (81), item 1 (66), and item 7 (60).
   
3. **Agent 2** values:
   - High valuation for item 0 (94), item 7 (99), and item 4 (81).
   
4. **Agent 3** values:
   - High valuation for item 5 (92), item 0 (89), and item 3 (88).
   
5. **Agent 4** values:
   - High valuation for item 7 (97), item 5 (88), and item 1 (64).

Considering these preferences, here's an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [2, 8] (valued item 2 highly, and item 8 is the next highest)
- **Agent 1**: [1, 4] (valued item 1 highly, and item 4 is the next highest)
- **Agent 2**: [0, 7] (valued item 0 highly, and item 7 is the next highest)
- **Agent 3**: [3, 5] (valued item 3 highly, and item 5 is the next highest)
- **Agent 4**: [6] (valued item 6, which is remaining)

This allocation attempts to ensure that each agent receives high-valued items according to their individual preferences, thus reducing potential envy among the agents. It's important to note that achieving perfect envy-freeness is often complex and may not be entirely possible with limited items and varying valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [6]
}
```
