Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  35  76  91   0   2  38  64  82
1  65  47  87  24  98  69  94  78  10
2   9  97  79  62  66  94  31  88  84
3  12  59  60   6   2   3  10  72  86
4   1  49  91  54  41  85  88  97  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[10 35 76 91  0  2 38 64 82]
 [65 47 87 24 98 69 94 78 10]
 [ 9 97 79 62 66 94 31 88 84]
 [12 59 60  6  2  3 10 72 86]
 [ 1 49 91 54 41 85 88 97 46]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim for an allocation that minimizes envy. Envy-freeness implies that each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation according to their own valuation.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [10, 35, 76, 91, 0, 2, 38, 64, 82]
Agent 1: [65, 47, 87, 24, 98, 69, 94, 78, 10]
Agent 2: [9, 97, 79, 62, 66, 94, 31, 88, 84]
Agent 3: [12, 59, 60, 6, 2, 3, 10, 72, 86]
Agent 4: [1, 49, 91, 54, 41, 85, 88, 97, 46]
```

I will attempt to assign the items such that each agent is satisfied with their allocation.

### Proposed Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [3, 8]
  - Valuation: 91 + 82 = 173

- **Agent 1**: [4, 6]
  - Valuation: 98 + 94 = 192

- **Agent 2**: [1, 5]
  - Valuation: 97 + 94 = 191

- **Agent 3**: [7]
  - Valuation: 72

- **Agent 4**: [0, 2]
  - Valuation: 1 + 91 = 92

This allocation attempts to give each agent high-value items according to their preferences, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives items that they value highly, aiming for a fair division that minimizes envy among the agents.
