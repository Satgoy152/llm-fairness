Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  33  74  99  78  23  75  99  47
1  86  54  66  89  45  73  15   2  49
2  67  96  68  94   4  49  69  89  66
3  10  93  21  61  19  88  18  20  40
4  35  82  11  95  61  34   1   8   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [35 82 11 95 61 34  1  8  4]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to ensure that the allocation is envy-free, or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

Given the valuations matrix, we can try to allocate the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while balancing the total value received by each agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Items 3, 7 (Values: 99, 99)
2. **Agent 1:** Items 0, 5 (Values: 86, 73)
3. **Agent 2:** Items 1, 2 (Values: 96, 68)
4. **Agent 3:** Items 6, 8 (Values: 18, 40)
5. **Agent 4:** Item 4 (Value: 61)

Now, let's format this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives according to their individual valuations, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share.
