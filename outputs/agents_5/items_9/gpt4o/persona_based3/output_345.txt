Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  65  66  47  79  84  13  92  53
1  37  30  72   2  69  20  47  30   4
2  35  91  47  39   5  82  54  97  22
3   7  20  85  25  62  42  82  57  79
4  94  33  44  48  58   0  84  54  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we can utilize concepts from the fair division theory, specifically aiming for envy-freeness and efficient allocation. One common approach is to allocate items such that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

We'll proceed by examining each agent's valuations and try to allocate items in a way that balances these preferences across all agents.

### Allocation Process

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 7.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuation for item 2.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 1 and 7.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 2, 6, and 8.
5. **Agent 4** highly values items 0 and 8.

Given these preferences, our goal is to distribute the items as evenly as possible while respecting the high valuations.

### Suggested Allocation

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 5
  - Item 0: Valuation 85 (high value)
  - Item 5: Valuation 84 (high value)
  
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
  - Item 2: Valuation 72 (high value)

- **Agent 2**: Items 1, 7
  - Item 1: Valuation 91 (high value)
  - Item 7: Valuation 97 (high value)

- **Agent 3**: Items 3, 6
  - Item 3: Valuation 25 (moderate value)
  - Item 6: Valuation 82 (high value)

- **Agent 4**: Items 4, 8
  - Item 4: Valuation 58 (moderate value)
  - Item 8: Valuation 85 (high value)

This allocation aims to ensure that each agent receives items with high personal value, thereby reducing potential envy.

### Final Allocations

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraints, ensuring all items are distributed, and each agent has an allocation that maximizes their individual valuations to the extent possible.
