Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3  57   2  34  24  87  14   4   1
1  33  55  70  89  60  45  13   2  62
2  91  46  83  56  77  59  42  15  60
3  13   0  46  29  57  83  85  24  48
4  88  90  49   8  71  24  15  63  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. In this context, we aim to distribute the items so that no agent feels envious of another's allocation, which means we should consider each agent's valuation of the items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (87)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (89)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (91)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 6 (85)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (90)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, so we need to allocate 4 more. We should try to allocate these remaining items based on the next highest valuations while ensuring that agents with fewer items get priority.

6. **Remaining Allocation:**
   - **Agent 2:** Next highest valuation: Item 2 (83)
     - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 2.
   - **Agent 4:** Next highest valuation: Item 4 (71)
     - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 4.
   - **Agent 4:** Next highest valuation: Item 8 (53)
     - Allocate Item 8 to Agent 4.
   - **Agent 3:** Next highest valuation: Item 7 (24)
     - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 3.

This ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations, with each item allocated exactly once.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [1, 4, 8]
}
```
