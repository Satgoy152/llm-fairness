Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3   8  55  28  58  65  41  13  37
1   5   7  15  59  95  80  96   8  42
2  84  25  10  96  78  73  74  61  26
3  73  34  54  10  97  89  94  64  67
4  26  44  52  10  23  70  46  84  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division with envy-freeness, we want to allocate the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share based on their valuations. This is a complex problem, but we can start by ensuring that each agent feels they have received at least as much as they could get from another agent's allocation.

To simplify, let's aim for a division that balances the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that maximize value based on Agent 0's preferences.
2. **Agent 1**: Similar approach, ensuring no envy.
3. **Agent 2**: Continue with this approach.
4. **Agent 3**: Continue with this approach.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate the remaining items.

Here's a possible allocation using a heuristic approach:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0, 1 (Total value = 3 + 8 = 11)
- **Agent 1**: Items 4, 8 (Total value = 95 + 42 = 137)
- **Agent 2**: Items 5, 6 (Total value = 73 + 74 = 147)
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 3 (Total value = 54 + 10 = 64)
- **Agent 4**: Item 7 (Total value = 84)

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation strives to balance the perceived value each agent receives based on their own valuations, while ensuring that all 9 items are allocated.
