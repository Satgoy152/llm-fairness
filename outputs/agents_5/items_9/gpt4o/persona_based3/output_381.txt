Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   0   7  31  39  48  62  64  61  36
1  80  42  33  71  42  63  88  26  76
2  87  14  79  76  96  17   0  80  63
3  10  32  61  22  88  77  16  65  61
4  26  97  76  20   3  96  69  18  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to consider envy-freeness, which means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own. Given the valuations matrix, let's proceed with a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 6 (64), 5 (62), 4 (48)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 6 (88), 0 (80), 3 (71)
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 4 (96), 0 (87), 3 (76), 7 (80)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 4 (88), 5 (77), 2 (61)
   - Allocate item 5 is already taken, so allocate item 4 is already taken, so allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value items: 1 (97), 5 (96), 2 (76)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, let's assign the remaining items to ensure fair division:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Remaining items: 0, 3, 7, 8
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (highest remaining value for Agent 0 is 36 for item 8).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Remaining items: 3, 7, 8
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 1 (highest remaining value for Agent 1 is 76 for item 8).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Remaining items: 3, 7
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (highest remaining value for Agent 2 is 80 for item 7).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Remaining item: 3
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (highest remaining value for Agent 3 is 22 for item 3).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - No remaining items.

Finally, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

Each agent receives an allocation, and all 9 items are distributed.
