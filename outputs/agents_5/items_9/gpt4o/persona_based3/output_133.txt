Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  80  66  25  54  18  10   4  30
1  26   8  71  32  71  87  46   4  10
2  87  64  10  56  59  43  50  28  65
3  14  13  40  12  46  95  65  52  80
4   4  55  68  24  13   3  33  11  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To create a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent values their own bundle of items at least as much as the bundles allocated to any other agent. Given the valuations, we will try to achieve a balance between fairness and total value received by each agent.

Let's go through the process of allocating the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuation for items: 0 (60), 1 (80), and 2 (66).
2. **Agent 1** values items 2 (71), 4 (71), and 5 (87) the highest.
3. **Agent 2** has top valuations for items: 0 (87), 1 (64), and 8 (65).
4. **Agent 3** values items 5 (95), 6 (65), and 8 (80) the highest.
5. **Agent 4** values items 2 (68), 1 (55), and 8 (68) the highest.

By examining these valuations, we can try to allocate the items such that no agent envies another. Here's an allocation strategy:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [0, 1]
  - Total value: 60 + 80 = 140

- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [4, 5]
  - Total value: 71 + 87 = 158

- **Agent 2**: Allocate item [8]
  - Total value: 65

- **Agent 3**: Allocate items [6, 7]
  - Total value: 65 + 52 = 117

- **Agent 4**: Allocate items [2, 3]
  - Total value: 68 + 24 = 92

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they highly value and aims for each agent to value their allocation without envy.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```
