Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  19  90  99  51  21  90  90   8
1  66   7  80  14  66  48   5  94  12
2  58  50  65  20  57  34  53  10  30
3  41  58  54  89  78  50  55  32  59
4   8  97  90  14  88  66  61  52  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to consider the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should not prefer the allocation of another agent over their own, given their valuations.

Let's break down the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items especially high at 3, 2, 6, and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations for item 7.
3. **Agent 2**: No extremely high valuations; has a more balanced spread.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly, and also has decent valuations for items 4 and 8.
5. **Agent 4**: Very high valuation for item 1, and also values item 8 highly.

Now, let's attempt a fair division:

- **Agent 0** could be allocated items 3 and 6. This gives them two of their highly valued items.
- **Agent 1** could receive item 7, which they value highly.
- **Agent 2** could be allocated item 2. This is one of the few remaining items with a decent valuation for Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** could receive item 4, and item 8. Item 4 is valued quite well by Agent 3, and item 8 is a moderately valuable item for them.
- **Agent 4** could receive items 1 and 5. Item 1 is the most valued by Agent 4, and item 5 is a reasonably valued item.

Let's ensure all items are allocated and no agent receives more than 2 items, except perhaps one agent who might need to take the extra item if needed to balance. We have:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 6]
- **Agent 1**: Item [7]
- **Agent 2**: Item [2]
- **Agent 3**: Items [4, 8]
- **Agent 4**: Items [1, 5]

Item 0 remains unallocated. Since Agent 0 values item 0 moderately high (58), we can allocate item 0 to Agent 0 to balance the distribution further, since they only have two items.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6, 0],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
