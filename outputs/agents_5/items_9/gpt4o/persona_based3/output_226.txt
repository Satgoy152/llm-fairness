Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91   5  72  60  88  72  15  72  83
1  93  51  75  89   8  85   6  70   0
2  90  18  84  12  61  58  44  24  87
3  42  35  64  97  51  83  97  78  90
4  88  26  87  71  23  79  38  15  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness and balance in the distribution. We'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: First, we calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items. This helps us understand which agents value the items most and can guide the allocation process.

2. **Initial Assignments**: Assign the items based on maximizing individual agent utility while ensuring that the allocation remains as balanced as possible.

3. **Check for Envy**: Adjust allocations to minimize envy. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own.

4. **Final Adjustments**: Ensure all items are allocated, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's calculate and allocate:

### Valuation Matrix:
- Agent 0: [91, 5, 72, 60, 88, 72, 15, 72, 83] - Total = 558
- Agent 1: [93, 51, 75, 89, 8, 85, 6, 70, 0] - Total = 477
- Agent 2: [90, 18, 84, 12, 61, 58, 44, 24, 87] - Total = 478
- Agent 3: [42, 35, 64, 97, 51, 83, 97, 78, 90] - Total = 637
- Agent 4: [88, 26, 87, 71, 23, 79, 38, 15, 21] - Total = 448

### Allocation Strategy:
- Assign items based on maximizing individual values while considering envy-freeness.
- We will prioritize agents with higher valuations for particular items.

### Allocation:
1. **Agent 0**: Items [0, 4]
   - Values: 91 (Item 0), 88 (Item 4)
   
2. **Agent 1**: Items [3, 5]
   - Values: 89 (Item 3), 85 (Item 5)
   
3. **Agent 2**: Items [2, 8]
   - Values: 84 (Item 2), 87 (Item 8)
   
4. **Agent 3**: Items [6, 7]
   - Values: 97 (Item 6), 78 (Item 7)
   
5. **Agent 4**: Item [1]
   - Values: 26 (Item 1)

These assignments ensure that each agent receives items for which they have a relatively high valuation, and the allocation is fair and integer-based.

### Final Allocations (JSON format):
```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [1]
}
```
