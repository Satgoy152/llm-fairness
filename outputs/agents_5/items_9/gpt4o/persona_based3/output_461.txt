Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  21  36  39  52  74   5  62  13
1   5  82   0  75  23  77  31  27  40
2  45  74  97  32  31  74  25  56   1
3  46  76  11  70   1   7  37  74  78
4  68  87   3  53  19  95  71  66  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents while trying to ensure envy-freeness, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's perceived value of their allocated bundle. One approach is to use the adjusted winner procedure or any other fair division algorithm that provides as close to envy-free allocations as possible. However, given the constraints, let's attempt a direct allocation that seeks to balance the total value each agent receives.

First, let's calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: 389
- Agent 1: 360
- Agent 2: 435
- Agent 3: 400
- Agent 4: 448

Next, we'll try to distribute the items so that each agent's allocation is as fair as possible in terms of their perceived total value, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 6]
  - Total value = 87 + 5 = 92

- Agent 1: Items [1, 3]
  - Total value = 82 + 75 = 157

- Agent 2: Items [2, 8]
  - Total value = 97 + 1 = 98

- Agent 3: Items [4, 7]
  - Total value = 1 + 74 = 75

- Agent 4: Items [5]
  - Total value = 95

This allocation attempts to distribute the items in a way that each agent receives a reasonable portion of their perceived value, given the constraints of integer item allocation.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [5]
}
```
