Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  98   4  59  20  72  68  64  68
1  32  59  28  27   3  61  80  80  48
2  73  48  83  54  46  76  94  62  84
3  26  98  54  67  61  75  82  87  55
4  58  50  81  37  22  76  44  93   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own bundle.

We'll use a simple heuristic approach to distribute the items based on the valuations, aiming to minimize envy. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation procedure:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuation for Each Item**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This initial step helps in reducing envy as each agent receives at least one item they highly value.

2. **Resolve Conflicts**: If multiple agents have the highest valuation for a single item, we will need to decide based on their overall allocation and remaining needs.

3. **Adjust Allocations**: Ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent has an integer number of items. Adjustments may be necessary to balance the allocations and ensure fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest value by Agent 2 (73)
- **Item 1**: Highest value by Agents 0 and 3 (98). Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Highest value by Agent 2 (83)
- **Item 3**: Highest value by Agent 0 (59)
- **Item 4**: Highest value by Agent 3 (61)
- **Item 5**: Highest value by Agent 0 (72)
- **Item 6**: Highest value by Agent 2 (94)
- **Item 7**: Highest value by Agent 4 (93)
- **Item 8**: Highest value by Agent 2 (84)

Now, let's distribute these allocations to ensure that all 9 items are distributed fairly:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 3, 5]
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items [0, 2, 6, 8]
- Agent 3: Item [4]
- Agent 4: Item [7]

The assignments ensure that each agent receives items, and the allocations are as fair as possible given the constraints and initial high valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 6, 8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7]
}
```
