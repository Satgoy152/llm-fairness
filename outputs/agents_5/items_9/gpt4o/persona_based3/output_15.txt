Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  15  91  23  11  11  75  52  68
1   0  24  99  64  93  56  10  33  17
2   7  56  75  20   0  54   7  56  10
3  76  43   0  69  86  93  74  91  95
4  95  91  99  59  82   3  31  66  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the 5 agents, we aim to achieve envy-freeness, where each agent feels that their allocation is at least as good as any other agent's allocation, based on their individual valuations.

Here's a strategy to allocate the items:

1. **Calculate Total Values:** Compute the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. **Greedy Allocation:** Allocate items one by one to the agent who values the unallocated item the most, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Values
- Agent 0: Total value = 417
- Agent 1: Total value = 396
- Agent 2: Total value = 285
- Agent 3: Total value = 627
- Agent 4: Total value = 622

### Step 2: Allocation of Items

- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most (99). Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most (95). Allocate to Agent 4.
- **Item 8**: Agent 4 values it the most (96). Allocate to Agent 4.
- **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most (93). Allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most (93). Allocate to Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most (69). Allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most (91). Allocate to Agent 3.
- **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most (91). Allocate to Agent 4.
- **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it the most (75). Allocate to Agent 0.

This allocation takes into account the agents' preferences to the highest degree possible, given the constraints.

### Final Allocation in JSON Format

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 5, 7],
    "4": [0, 1, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents based on their preferences, aiming to minimize envy.
