Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  96  27  61  74  75  81   4  41
1  61  46  69   0  26  16  35  14  31
2  26  47  36  69  85  56  82  28  40
3  64  48  60  68  59  43  89  27  99
4  54  92  30  84  48  58  73  79  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to ensure that the allocation is envy-free as much as possible. An envy-free allocation is one in which no agent prefers the bundle of items received by any other agent over their own bundle, given their own valuations.

We begin by considering how to distribute the items such that each agent gets a portion they value highly, while considering the overall balance of values received by each agent. We will try to ensure that no agent feels envious of another's allocation based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair division:

1. **Maximize Individual Satisfaction**: First, look at each agentâ€™s highest-valued items and try to allocate those to the respective agents if possible.
2. **Balance the Overall Value**: Ensure that the total value received by each agent is roughly equivalent, preventing significant differences in perceived fairness.
3. **Ensure Completeness**: All items must be allocated, and each agent should receive an integer number of items.

Applying this strategy, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 highly values item 1 (96) and item 6 (81). Assign these items to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 (61) and item 2 (69) highly. Assign these items to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has a very high value for item 4 (85) and also values item 6 (82), but item 6 is already taken. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 8 (99) the highest. Assign item 8 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 3 (84) and item 1 (92) highly, but item 1 is taken. Assign item 3 to agent 4.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items such that the total value across agents is balanced:

- Items 5 and 7 are left. Assign item 5 to agent 3 and item 7 to agent 2.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 2]
- Agent 2: [4, 7]
- Agent 3: [8, 5]
- Agent 4: [3]

Here is the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [8, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to minimize envy and balance the total value received by each agent based on their individual valuations.
