Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  69  84  77  12  56  59  86  27
1  12  84  99  23   8  27  69  95  25
2  46  67  70  86  75  93  14  94  27
3  91  44  76  86  40  14   1  52  26
4  17  32  61  31  99  94  82   4  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, I will use a method that seeks to minimize envy, ensuring that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. Since there are 5 agents and 9 items, we can start by aiming to allocate approximately 1 or 2 items per agent, with some agents potentially receiving 2 items, given the odd number of total items.

Let's evaluate and allocate based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for items 7 (86) and 2 (84).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations are for items 2 (99) and 7 (95).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations are for items 5 (93) and 7 (94).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuations are for items 0 (91) and 3 (86).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuations are for items 4 (99) and 8 (99).

Now, let's allocate based on maximizing each agent's preference while ensuring no item is allocated more than once:

- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values item 7 the highest.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values item 2 the highest.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 values item 0 the highest.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 4, as Agent 4 values item 4 the highest.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values item 5 the second highest.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values item 3 highly.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 4, as Agent 4 values item 8 highly.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0, as Agent 0 values item 1 highly.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values item 6 highly.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items according to their highest valuations without duplication:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation provides a fair distribution based on the given valuations, ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly, while maintaining the constraint of allocating all 9 items.
