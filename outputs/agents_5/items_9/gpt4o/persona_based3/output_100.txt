Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  49  35  29   1   4  31  76  53
1  43  63  92  49  12  54  57  96  43
2  26  83  64   7   9  41   7  30  57
3  28   0   7  11  11  81  46  39  39
4  41  47   6  64  63   6  87  20   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution, where no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations, we'll proceed to allocate the items in a way that aims to balance the perceived value each agent receives.

Let's calculate a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Valuations are: [79, 49, 35, 29, 1, 4, 31, 76, 53]
   - Highest value: Item 0 (79) and Item 7 (76)
   - Allocation: [0, 7]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Valuations are: [43, 63, 92, 49, 12, 54, 57, 96, 43]
   - Highest value: Item 2 (92)
   - Second highest: Item 7 (96) but already taken by Agent 0, next is Item 5 (54)
   - Allocation: [2, 5]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Valuations are: [26, 83, 64, 7, 9, 41, 7, 30, 57]
   - Highest value: Item 1 (83)
   - Allocation: [1]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Valuations are: [28, 0, 7, 11, 11, 81, 46, 39, 39]
   - Highest value: Item 5 (81) but already taken by Agent 1, next is Item 6 (46)
   - Allocation: [6]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Valuations are: [41, 47, 6, 64, 63, 6, 87, 20, 5]
   - Highest value: Item 6 (87) but already taken by Agent 3, next is Item 3 (64)
   - Allocation: [3, 4, 8]

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated and no item is allocated more than once. The allocation is:

Agent 0: Items [0, 7]  
Agent 1: Items [2, 5]  
Agent 2: Items [1]  
Agent 3: Items [6]  
Agent 4: Items [3, 4, 8]  

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent has a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 4, 8]
}
```
