Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  32  66  26  72  25  62  47  94
1   2   7  65  61  94  73   3  72  75
2  43  57  70  58  77  87  83  22  47
3  86  94  89  87  91  44  34  24  25
4  29   1   8   1  29  94  88  94  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim for an envy-free distribution where each agent feels they received a fair share relative to their valuation of the items. Given the complexity of achieving exact envy-freeness in all scenarios, I'll attempt to provide a balanced allocation that considers the agents' valuations. 

Let's start by examining the table of valuations and try to allocate high-value items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of their perceived value.

### Allocation Strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 8 (value 94), so we assign item 8 to agent 0. This agent also values item 4 relatively high (value 72), so we allocate item 4 as well.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 highly (value 94), but it's already allocated. The next highest value is item 2 (value 65), so we assign item 2 to agent 1. Additionally, item 3 has a high value (61), so we allocate it to agent 1 as well.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 5 (value 87) and item 6 (value 83), so we allocate these two items to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 0 (values 94 and 86, respectively), so we allocate items 0 and 1 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The remaining unallocated item is item 7, which can be reasonably allocated to agent 4, since agent 4 values it fairly high (value 94).

### Allocation:

Following this strategy, we ensure that each agent receives a fair portion of the items based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by giving agents items they highly value while still distributing the items fairly across all agents.
