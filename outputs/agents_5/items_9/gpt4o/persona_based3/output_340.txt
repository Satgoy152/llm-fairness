Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  13  15  91  93  47  38  23  57
1  33  70  48  12  46  95  63  98  19
2  87  55  62  36  86  77  88  78  59
3  35  44  20  13  39  30  65  34  11
4  48  41  45  55  72  66  71  21  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[66 13 15 91 93 47 38 23 57]
 [33 70 48 12 46 95 63 98 19]
 [87 55 62 36 86 77 88 78 59]
 [35 44 20 13 39 30 65 34 11]
 [48 41 45 55 72 66 71 21 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring envy-freeness, we need to make sure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value at least as much as any other agent's bundle of items.

Given the valuations in the table, we aim to allocate the 9 items such that each agent feels they have received a fair share. Hereâ€™s one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are [66, 13, 15, 91, 93, 47, 38, 23, 57]. Agent 0 highly values items 3 and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are [33, 70, 48, 12, 46, 95, 63, 98, 19]. Agent 1 highly values items 5 and 7.
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are [87, 55, 62, 36, 86, 77, 88, 78, 59]. Agent 2 highly values items 0 and 6.
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are [35, 44, 20, 13, 39, 30, 65, 34, 11]. Agent 3 highly values item 6, but since it is already allocated, we will have to allocate less valued items such as 1 and 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are [48, 41, 45, 55, 72, 66, 71, 21, 99]. Agent 4 highly values item 8.

Given these observations, here is a possible allocation that accounts for high individual valuations and ensures that each agent receives items they value:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item they highly value, which should help in achieving a fair division and minimize envy.
