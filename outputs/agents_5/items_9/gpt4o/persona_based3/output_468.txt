Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  17  63  82  96  38  60  30  97
1  24  52  36  95   3  53  87  38   9
2  60  50   8  66  58  54  33  81  76
3  22  82  12  45  26  11  83  29  91
4  11  38  47  77  67  23  10  93  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the agents' valuations of each item and try to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair compared to what others receive. This can be a complex problem, but here is one approach to achieving a fair division:

1. **Ensure each agent gets items**: Since there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will get 2 items while others will get 1.

2. **Maximize agent satisfaction**: Try to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly while maintaining fairness.

3. **Balance total valuation**: Try to balance the total valuation of items each agent receives.

Let's allocate the items based on these principles:

- Agent 0 highly values item 4 (96) and item 3 (82).
- Agent 1 highly values item 3 (95) and item 6 (87).
- Agent 2 highly values item 0 (60) and item 8 (76).
- Agent 3 highly values item 1 (82) and item 8 (91).
- Agent 4 highly values item 8 (98) and item 7 (93).

Given these preferences, we can propose the following allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Get items [3, 4]
- **Agent 1**: Get items [6]
- **Agent 2**: Get items [0]
- **Agent 3**: Get items [1, 8]
- **Agent 4**: Get items [2, 5, 7]

This allocation gives each agent a portion of items they value significantly, and attempts to balance the total value received by each agent.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
