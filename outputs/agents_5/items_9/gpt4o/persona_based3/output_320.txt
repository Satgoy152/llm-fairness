Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11   8  48  65  37   2  25  79  75
1  82  10  20  88  93  39  57  56  36
2  51  86  21  66  90  82  30  19  28
3  79  24  89  13  11  52  11  40  83
4  28  82  17  62  28   6  64   4  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate items fairly among the agents, we aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that maximizes their utility while balancing the distribution of total value. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: 11 + 8 + 48 + 65 + 37 + 2 + 25 + 79 + 75 = 350
   - Agent 1: 82 + 10 + 20 + 88 + 93 + 39 + 57 + 56 + 36 = 481
   - Agent 2: 51 + 86 + 21 + 66 + 90 + 82 + 30 + 19 + 28 = 473
   - Agent 3: 79 + 24 + 89 + 13 + 11 + 52 + 11 + 40 + 83 = 402
   - Agent 4: 28 + 82 + 17 + 62 + 28 + 6 + 64 + 4 + 37 = 328

2. **Allocate Items Using a Greedy Approach:**
   - Start by allocating the item to the agent who values it the most to reduce envy, making sure each agent receives a fair share of total value.

3. **Determine Allocations:**
   - Item 0: Highest value by Agent 1 (82)
   - Item 1: Highest value by Agent 2 (86)
   - Item 2: Highest value by Agent 3 (89)
   - Item 3: Highest value by Agent 1 (88)
   - Item 4: Highest value by Agent 1 (93)
   - Item 5: Highest value by Agent 2 (82)
   - Item 6: Highest value by Agent 4 (64)
   - Item 7: Highest value by Agent 0 (79)
   - Item 8: Highest value by Agent 3 (83)

4. **Balanced Allocation:**
   - Ensure each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets too disproportionate a share.

5. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [7]
   - Agent 1: [0, 3, 4]
   - Agent 2: [1, 5]
   - Agent 3: [2, 8]
   - Agent 4: [6]

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 3, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute items such that agents receive a fair share based on their valuations while minimizing envy.
