Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  97  45  13  28  66  38  63  62
1  52  87  81  69  75  14  63  36  46
2  72  50  46  74  14  95  30  33  75
3   9  94  55  43  35  26  92  66  37
4   4  92  85   0  79  25  40   6  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation, where each agent values their own allocation at least as much as any other agent's allocation. Given the constraints and the goal of minimizing envy, we will employ a simple heuristic approach to allocate the items, keeping in mind that exact envy-freeness might not always be possible given the disparity in valuations.

### Steps:
1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent**: Sum up the values each agent has for all items to understand their overall preferences.
2. **Sort Items for Each Agent**: Determine each agent's preference for items by sorting items based on their individual valuations.
3. **Allocate Items**: Iteratively assign items to agents based on their highest preference, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

### Calculations:
- **Total Valuations**:
  - Agent 0: 468
  - Agent 1: 523
  - Agent 2: 489
  - Agent 3: 457
  - Agent 4: 394

- **Sorted Preferences**:
  - Agent 0: [1, 5, 8, 7, 0, 2, 6, 4, 3]
  - Agent 1: [2, 1, 4, 3, 0, 6, 8, 7, 5]
  - Agent 2: [5, 8, 3, 0, 1, 2, 7, 6, 4]
  - Agent 3: [6, 1, 7, 2, 4, 3, 8, 5, 0]
  - Agent 4: [2, 1, 4, 8, 6, 5, 7, 0, 3]

### Allocation Strategy:
We will allocate items based on the sorted preferences list considering each agent's turn in a round-robin fashion, trying to respect their preferences while ensuring each agent receives some items.

1. **Round 1**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 1
   - Agent 1 gets item 2
   - Agent 2 gets item 5
   - Agent 3 gets item 6
   - Agent 4 gets item 4

2. **Round 2**:
   - Agent 0 gets item 8
   - Agent 1 gets item 3
   - Agent 2 gets item 0
   - Agent 3 gets item 7

3. **Remaining**: All 9 items are allocated.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to respect the preferences of each agent as much as possible, given the constraints and the need to allocate all items.
