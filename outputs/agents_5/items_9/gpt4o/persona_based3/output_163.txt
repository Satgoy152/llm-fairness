Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  72  14  85  84  41   4  97  35
1  23  99  33  44  23   0  13  67  69
2  11  25  75  24  61  79   5  21  26
3  88  20   7  19  10  57  31  24  93
4  59   3  72  60  84  10  16  14  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness (where no agent prefers another agent's allocation to their own), we can apply the method of maximizing the minimum utility or using a round-robin allocation based on rankings or valuations. Given the constraints and the goal of ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, I'll proceed with a round-robin method based on the agents' valuations to ensure a fair distribution.

### Allocation Process

1. **Calculate the Total Value for Each Agent**: 
   - Agent 0: 504
   - Agent 1: 371
   - Agent 2: 327
   - Agent 3: 349
   - Agent 4: 353

2. **Order of Picking**: 
   - Agents will pick items in the order of their total valuations, starting with the highest. The sequence is: Agent 0, Agent 1, Agent 4, Agent 3, Agent 2.

3. **Round-Robin Allocation**: 
   - Each agent picks the item with the highest value to them that hasn't been picked yet. This continues until all items are allocated.

### Allocation

- **Agent 0** picks items: 7, 3
- **Agent 1** picks items: 1, 8
- **Agent 4** picks items: 4, 2
- **Agent 3** picks item: 0
- **Agent 2** picks items: 5, 6

### Fair Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation is designed to be fair in terms of each agent receiving items they highly value and spreading the allocation across the agents based on their preferences.
