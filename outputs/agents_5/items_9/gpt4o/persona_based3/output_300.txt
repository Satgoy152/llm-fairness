Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  24  35  56  78  15  78  70  73
1  35  58  95  63  95  78   4  59   5
2  72  47  38  67   3   3   5  99  10
3  81  42  61  74  24  27  39  58  25
4  35  42  84  70  65  60  60  57  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim for a division that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible. This means each agent should feel they received a fair share based on their valuations. Given the matrix of valuations, we'll attempt to distribute the items to maximize fairness and minimize envy.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Initial Observation**:
   - Each agent should receive about 1 or 2 items since we have 5 agents and 9 items.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Start by assigning items to agents who value them the most, ensuring no items are left unallocated.
   - Adjust allocations to balance out the distribution so that each agent ends up with a similar total value, if possible.

3. **Assign Items to Agents**:
   - Agent 0: Initial high-value choices are items 4, 6, and 7.
   - Agent 1: Values item 2 the highest, followed by items 4 and 5.
   - Agent 2: Highest value is for item 7, followed by item 3.
   - Agent 3: High values for items 0 and 3.
   - Agent 4: High values for items 2 and 8.

The allocation needs to balance values across agents and ensure all items are distributed.

4. **Final Allocation**:
   - After adjustments, here's a fair distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [1, 5, 8]
}
```

In this distribution:
- Agent 0 gets items 4 and 6, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 2, their highest-valued item.
- Agent 2 receives item 7, their highest-valued item.
- Agent 3 receives items 0 and 3, with decent valuations.
- Agent 4 receives items 1, 5, and 8, balancing their overall valuation.

This allocation aims to minimize envy by ensuring each agent receives items they highly value, providing a fair division based on the given valuations.
