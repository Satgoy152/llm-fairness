Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  53  81  46  89  35  52  44   0
1   7  68  70  27  90   9  77  35  53
2  26  29  13  48  27  40  47  84  48
3  79  96  18  44  98  13   0  47  80
4  39  11  32  73   8  84  90  60  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent receives a bundle of items that they value as much as possible, given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items. The goal is to minimize envy among the agents, where envy is defined as a situation where an agent prefers the bundle of another agent over their own.

One way to approach this problem is to use a round-robin algorithm or a sequential allocation based on the agents' valuations. We can start by determining the maximum value each agent can achieve and then allocate items in such a way as to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's one approach to allocating the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agents, giving each agent the item that increases their total value the most without causing excessive envy.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Applying this to the given valuations:

- Agent 0: (64, 53, 81, 46, 89, 35, 52, 44, 0)
- Agent 1: (7, 68, 70, 27, 90, 9, 77, 35, 53)
- Agent 2: (26, 29, 13, 48, 27, 40, 47, 84, 48)
- Agent 3: (79, 96, 18, 44, 98, 13, 0, 47, 80)
- Agent 4: (39, 11, 32, 73, 8, 84, 90, 60, 40)

Let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 3 values item 4 the most (98). Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 next (90), but it's already taken. The next best for Agent 1 is item 2 (70). Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values item 4 the most (89), but it's taken. The next best for Agent 0 is item 2 (81), but taken. Allocate item 0 (64) to Agent 0.
4. Agent 4 values item 6 the most (90). Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
5. Agent 2 values item 7 the most (84). Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
6. Agent 3's next best is item 1 (96). Allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
7. Agent 0's next best is item 3 (46). Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
8. Agent 1's next best is item 8 (53). Allocate item 8 to Agent 1.
9. Agent 4's next best is item 5 (84). Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [4, 1],
    "4": [6, 5]
}
```

This allocation aims to distribute the items fairly, considering each agentâ€™s highest valuations while ensuring all items are allocated.
