Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  34   6  45   6  61   7  56  59
1  25  83  47  66  39  11  44  38  72
2  85  73  19  84  14  75  76  59  93
3   4  24  33  38  77  51   1  90  67
4  90  99  16  47  38  33   1  64   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. We will also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

One strategy is to use the "envy graph" approach which ensures that no cycles exist in the envy graph, leading to an envy-free allocation. However, given the small number of agents and items, we can also attempt to balance the total value each agent receives according to their own valuations.

### Approach:
1. **Calculate Total Valuation:** Determine the total valuation of each item for each agent.
2. **Greedy Allocation:** Assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most, while checking for potential envy and ensuring each gets an integer number of items.

### Allocation:
Let's proceed with the assignment by selecting the highest-valued unallocated item for each agent, ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value item is 5 (value = 61).
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value item is 1 (value = 83).
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value item is 8 (value = 93).
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value item is 7 (value = 90).
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value item is 1 (already taken), next is 0 (value = 90).

Continue assigning remaining items while balancing fairness:

6. **Agent 3:** Next highest available is item 4 (value = 77).
7. **Agent 0:** Next highest available is item 7 (value = 56, already taken by agent 3), next is 8 (value = 59, already taken by agent 2), next is 3 (value = 45).
8. **Agent 1:** Next highest available is item 3 (already taken), next is 0 (value = 25, already taken by agent 4), next is 6 (value = 44).
9. **Agent 2:** Next highest available is item 2 (value = 19).

After carefully analyzing the assignments to ensure non-overlapping and fulfilling constraints, the final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [8, 2],
    "3": [7, 4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the allocation aims to be as fair and envy-free as possible given the constraints.
