Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  67  52  22  13  78  11  68  43
1  96  82  48  71  50  32  15  95  88
2  14  74  89  17  19  98  19  41  84
3  12   0  87  45   6  10  36  70  38
4  34  26  72  48  85  19  81  77  96

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this fair division problem, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. This approach will aim to distribute the items in a way that is fair and possibly envy-free.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Prioritize giving items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
3. Continue allocating items while maintaining a fair distribution based on valuations.

Let's calculate the total valuations:

- Agent 0: 24 + 67 + 52 + 22 + 13 + 78 + 11 + 68 + 43 = 378
- Agent 1: 96 + 82 + 48 + 71 + 50 + 32 + 15 + 95 + 88 = 577
- Agent 2: 14 + 74 + 89 + 17 + 19 + 98 + 19 + 41 + 84 = 455
- Agent 3: 12 + 0 + 87 + 45 + 6 + 10 + 36 + 70 + 38 = 304
- Agent 4: 34 + 26 + 72 + 48 + 85 + 19 + 81 + 77 + 96 = 538

Now, we allocate the items:

1. Agent 1 has the highest valuation, starting with items they value most: items 0, 1, 7, and 8.
2. Agent 4 has the next highest valuation, starting with items they value most: items 4 and 6.
3. Agent 2 has the third highest valuation, starting with items they value most: item 5.
4. Agent 0, ensure they get at least one item: item 2.
5. Agent 3, ensure they get at least one item: item 3.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 7, 8]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4, 6]

The allocation is checked to ensure that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item.

{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1, 7, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
