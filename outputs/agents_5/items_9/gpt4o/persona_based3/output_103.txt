Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  24  36  73  17  20  29  40  86
1  12   6   4  20  92  45   2  70  85
2  88  76  94  66  83  42  62  40  97
3  57  55  67  37  13  60  75  15  44
4  38  26  84  61  94  70  12  28  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free or approximately envy-free allocation. This means we want to allocate items such that no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own, or we minimize such situations.

Given the valuations, we will attempt to allocate the items based on maximizing the total satisfaction of each agent, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Highest Valuation per Agent**: Start by allocating items that each agent values the most.
2. **Balance Allocation**: Ensure each agent receives a fair number of items, aiming for around 1 or 2 items per agent given there are 9 items and 5 agents.
3. **Envy Minimization**: Adjust allocations to ensure no agent has significant envy over another.

### Allocation Steps:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value items for Agent 0 are 8 (86), 3 (73), and 2 (36). Allocate item 8 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Highest value items for Agent 1 are 4 (92), 8 (85), and 7 (70). Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Highest value items for Agent 2 are 8 (97), 2 (94), and 0 (88). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Highest value items for Agent 3 are 6 (75), 2 (67), and 5 (60). Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Highest value items for Agent 4 are 4 (94), 2 (84), and 5 (70). Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Thus far, we have allocated 5 items. Let's allocate the remaining 4 items to further balance and minimize envy:

- **Remaining Items**: 0, 1, 3, 7
- **Agent 0**: Allocate item 3 (73) as Agent 0 values it highly.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 7 (70) as Agent 1 values it highly.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 0 (88) as Agent 2 values it highly.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1 (55) as Agent 3 values it reasonably.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [6, 1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items. The allocation aims to be as fair as possible based on the given valuations.
