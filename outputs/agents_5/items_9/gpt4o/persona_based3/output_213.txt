Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  59  60  89  63   5  92  34  44
1   3  62  26   1  95  94  23  85  59
2  95  19  43  84  23  97  88  28  84
3  81  75  39  69  65  45   6  56  70
4  48  27  17  43  90  90  76   0  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents, we aim for an envy-free allocation, which means each agent should feel that their allocation is at least as good as any other, based on their valuations. This often involves careful consideration of each agent's preferences and ensuring that the allocation is as balanced as possible.

Given the valuations in the table, one common approach is to use algorithms or methods such as the adjusted winner procedure, but for simplicity, we will try to manually find an allocation that seems fair and balanced based on their valuations.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Given their high valuation for items 0, 3, and 6, allocate items 0 and 6.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items 4 and 5, which have the highest valuations for Agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items 2 and 8, which are relatively high in their preference list.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items 1, which is the highest valued item left for them.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate items 3 and 7, which are among their higher preferences.

This allocation aims to ensure each agent receives items that are among their top preferences, thereby minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
``` 

This allocation assigns all 9 items, and each agent gets at least one item except for Agent 3 who receives a single item due to their distribution of high valuations. This should provide a relatively fair division based on the given valuations.
