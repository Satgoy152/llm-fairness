Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  90   3  52   9   3  40  19  19
1  48  88  57  57  13  73  56  72  82
2   6   1  60  35  36   3  88  80  76
3  62  11  97  16  92  71  88  34   6
4  94  63  74  16  52  16  44   3  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. Env-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own, based on their valuations.

Let's use a strategy to ensure that the allocations are as fair as possible. One common approach is to use a "round-robin" mechanism, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that is still available. This strategy can help achieve a fair distribution, although achieving perfect envy-freeness can be challenging with discrete items.

Let's proceed with this allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 picks item 1 (value = 90).
2. Agent 1 picks item 1, but it's already taken, so they pick item 8 (value = 82).
3. Agent 2 picks item 6 (value = 88).
4. Agent 3 picks item 2 (value = 97).
5. Agent 4 picks item 0 (value = 94).

Now, let's continue the allocation process:

6. Agent 0 picks item 0, but it's taken, so they pick item 3 (value = 52).
7. Agent 1 picks item 5 (value = 73).
8. Agent 2 picks item 7 (value = 80).
9. Agent 3 picks item 4 (value = 92).

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated fairly. Let's consider the remaining unallocated items:

- Item 2 (Agent 2 picks as it provides them value).
- Item 5 (picked by Agent 1 as it gives them value and fits with current allocation).

After making these picks, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [8, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 5 agents. Although perfect envy-freeness may not be achieved due to the discrete nature of the items, this allocation attempts to balance the agents' preferences based on their valuations.
