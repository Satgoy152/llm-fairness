Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  47  19  81  87  38  32  10  87
1  50  86  60  96  77  74  75  47   0
2  34  57  39  45  61  19  33  64  26
3  45  82  33  28  69  87   2  74  38
4   6  73  57  39  28   5  54  61  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use an envy-free approach. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given the complexity of achieving perfect envy-freeness with discrete items, we aim for a balanced approach where each agent receives items that maximize their own valuations while considering the overall fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values items 4 and 8 highly (both at 87). Assign item 4 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** values item 5 highly (87). Assign item 5 to agent 3.
4. **Agent 1** also values item 1 highly (86). Assign item 1 to agent 1.
5. **Agent 3** values item 7 highly (74). Assign item 7 to agent 3.
6. **Agent 2** values item 7 highly (64), but it's already assigned. Next, assign item 1 to agent 2, but it's taken. Assign item 8 to agent 2.
7. **Agent 0** gets item 8 (valued at 87), but it's taken. Assign item 2 to agent 0 (valued at 19).
8. **Agent 4** values item 1 highly (73), but it's taken. Assign item 6 to agent 4 (valued at 54).
9. **Agent 0** gets item 0 (valued at 7).

Now, let's ensure each agent has items, and the allocation is envy-free to a reasonable extent:

- Agent 0: [4, 2, 0]
- Agent 1: [3, 1]
- Agent 2: [8]
- Agent 3: [5, 7]
- Agent 4: [6]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2, 0],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation considers individual valuations and attempts to balance fairness across agents, given the constraints.
