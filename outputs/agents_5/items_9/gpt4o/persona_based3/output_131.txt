Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  27  45  33  76  28  17  87  30
1  94  41  71  53  31   6  42  37  30
2  33  47  49  80  37  21  26  21  30
3   4   0  35  64  35  44  14  79  32
4  81  16  51  85  71  53  10  90  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while aiming for envy-freeness, we should try to balance the distribution of each agent's perceived value. This means we should aim for each agent to believe they received a fair share of the total value of all items according to their valuations.

Let's start by calculating the total value each agent assigns to all items:

- Agent 0: \(16 + 27 + 45 + 33 + 76 + 28 + 17 + 87 + 30 = 359\)
- Agent 1: \(94 + 41 + 71 + 53 + 31 + 6 + 42 + 37 + 30 = 365\)
- Agent 2: \(33 + 47 + 49 + 80 + 37 + 21 + 26 + 21 + 30 = 344\)
- Agent 3: \(4 + 0 + 35 + 64 + 35 + 44 + 14 + 79 + 32 = 307\)
- Agent 4: \(81 + 16 + 51 + 85 + 71 + 53 + 10 + 90 + 74 = 531\)

Now, let's try to distribute the items such that each agent feels they have received a fair portion of the value, keeping in mind that each agent should receive an integer number of items. We will aim to balance the total perceived value while ensuring all items are allocated.

Using this information, we can proceed with a round-robin approach or allocate items based on highest relative value to each agent. Here is one potential solution:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 7 (87) and item 4 (76).
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 (94) and item 2 (71).
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3 (80).
4. Agent 3 highly values item 7 (79).
5. Agent 4 highly values item 3 (85) and item 8 (74).

Let's allocate based on the above observations:

- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

This allocation should ideally balance perceived values as well as possible given the constraints. The final allocation can be formatted in JSON as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 8, 1]
}
```

Make sure to confirm that each item is only allocated once and all items are allocated.
