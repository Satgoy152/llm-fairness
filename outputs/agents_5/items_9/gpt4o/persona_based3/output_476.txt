Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  59  15  24  81  64  55  56  28  21
1  26  76  65  65  48  22  64  70  56
2  19  35  31  46  68  71  44  55  34
3  23  98   8  48  52  95  87  27  99
4  77  44  32  81  99  77  27  40  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an allocation that is envy-free or as close to envy-free as possible, given the valuations. An envy-free allocation is one where no agent prefers the bundle of items allocated to another agent over their own.

Here's one possible allocation approach using a method that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives:

1. Calculate the sum of valuations for each item across all agents.
2. Allocate items to agents such that each agent receives items maximizing their valuations, while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Given the complexity and constraints of fairness, an exact envy-free allocation might not be possible, but we can come close:

### Valuations Matrix:
```
Agent\Item  0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0          59  15  24  81  64  55  56  28  21
1          26  76  65  65  48  22  64  70  56
2          19  35  31  46  68  71  44  55  34
3          23  98   8  48  52  95  87  27  99
4          77  44  32  81  99  77  27  40  79
```

### Allocation Strategy:
- Start by allocating items based on the maximum individual valuation.
- Adjust for balance in the total valuation received by each agent.
- Ensure that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation based on the above strategy:

1. Allocate item 3 to agent 0 (value 81, highest individual value for agent 0).
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 1 (value 76, highest individual value for agent 1).
3. Allocate item 5 to agent 2 (value 71, highest individual value for agent 2).
4. Allocate item 8 to agent 3 (value 99, highest individual value for agent 3).
5. Allocate item 4 to agent 4 (value 99, highest individual value for agent 4).
6. Allocate item 0 to agent 4 (value 77, second highest unallocated value).
7. Allocate item 7 to agent 2 (value 55, second highest unallocated value for agent 2).
8. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 (value 65, second highest unallocated value for agent 1).
9. Allocate item 6 to agent 3 (value 87, second highest unallocated value for agent 3).

### Final Allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [8, 6],
    "4": [4, 0]
}
```

This allocation tries to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly while balancing total valuations across agents. Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
