Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  47  91  67  71  45  15  12  11
1  20  99  30  60  67  20  55  77  25
2  77  61  48   9  95  18  25  94  22
3  64  46  55  87  85  69  97  52  46
4  40  82   5  37  40  16  58  97  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets a set of items that maximizes their satisfaction while maintaining envy-freeness. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the nature of valuations, one effective approach is to use the "round-robin" method, where agents take turns picking their most valued item that is still available.

Let's start by determining the preference of each agent for the items, selecting the highest valued item available for each agent during each round. To ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, we'll allocate one item per turn in a round-robin fashion until all items are distributed.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Round 1:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 2 (value 91)
   - Agent 1 picks item 1 (value 99)
   - Agent 2 picks item 4 (value 95)
   - Agent 3 picks item 6 (value 97)
   - Agent 4 picks item 7 (value 97)

2. **Round 2:**
   - Agent 0 picks item 0 (value 90)
   - Agent 1 picks item 7 (already taken), so picks item 3 (value 60)
   - Agent 2 picks item 0 (already taken), so picks item 7 (already taken), so picks item 1 (value 61)
   - Agent 3 picks item 3 (already taken), so picks item 4 (already taken), so picks item 0 (already taken), so picks item 5 (value 69)
   - Agent 4 picks item 8 (value 79)

3. **Remaining Items:**
   - Item 5 is picked by Agent 0 (since items with higher preference are taken)
   - Item 6 is picked by Agent 1 (since items with higher preference are taken)

Now the allocation is complete. 

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 3, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6, 5],
    "4": [7, 8]
}
```

Note: The allocation attempts to prioritize the highest valued items for each agent while ensuring each agent gets items in a fair manner according to the round-robin method. Each agent has been considered for items based on their preference list.
