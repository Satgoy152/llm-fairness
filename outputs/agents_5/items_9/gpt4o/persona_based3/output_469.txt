Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  47   8  71  18  41  70  12  69
1  93  65  37   5  46  35  84   7   3
2  56   1  61  80  96  43  29   4  21
3  54   5  16  54  93  23  26  88  41
4  29  77  28  16  40  18  37  27   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an allocation that is as envy-free as possible. Envy-freeness means each agent should feel that their share of items is at least as valuable as the share of any other agent.

Given the valuations, we can attempt to distribute items to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 3 (71), item 6 (70), and item 8 (69).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 0 (93), item 6 (84), and item 1 (65).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 4 (96), item 3 (80), and item 2 (61).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 4 (93), item 7 (88), and item 0 (54).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 1 (77), item 4 (40), and item 7 (27).

Based on these preferences, the allocation attempt is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 3 and item 8.
- Agent 1 gets item 0 and item 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 4 and item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 7.
- Agent 4 gets item 1 and item 5.

This allocation attempts to maximize the individual values for each agent by considering their top preferences and ensuring each agent receives a share that maximizes their valuation.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
