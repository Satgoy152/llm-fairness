Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  56   3  51   8  23  19  80  86
1  38   9  16  65  94  43  47  80  88
2  12  93  58  62  84  90  96  10  93
3  13  68  31  43  93   2  41  47  12
4   5  72  11  44  11  60   9  11  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can utilize the concept of envy-freeness and attempt to equalize the perceived value each agent receives as much as possible. Given the valuations in the table, we aim to assign items such that no agent envies another agent's allocation based on their own valuation.

One approach is to use a method akin to the "adjusted winner" procedure, where items are allocated to the agent who values them the most until all items are assigned, while ensuring that the distribution remains as balanced as possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 8 to Agent 1 (value 88).
2. Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 80).
3. Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (value 90).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value 94).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 58).
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 93).
7. Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (value 76).
8. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value 65).
9. Assign item 6 to Agent 3 (value 41).

Now, let's present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3, 4, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a reasonable share of their highest-valued items while ensuring that all 9 items are allocated. Note that Agent 4 does not receive any items since their valuations are generally lower compared to others, and it is not possible to distribute items to them without reducing the perceived fairness for others significantly.
