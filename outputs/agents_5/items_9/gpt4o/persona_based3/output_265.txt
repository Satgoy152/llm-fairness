Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  41  39  85  93  75   4  46  65
1   4  52  95  57  92  42   1  48  31
2  16   4  10  98  39  56  32  68  40
3  89  20  68  70  83  64  88  22  42
4  49  64  50  94  81  89  11  95  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [49 64 50 94 81 89 11 95 51]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we aim to distribute the items such that no agent prefers the allocation of another agent over their own. Given the valuations table, we can use a heuristic approach to find a fair allocation.

Let's examine the valuations table and try to allocate the items by considering each agent's preferences and attempting to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 8.
- Agent 3 gets items 6 and 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 7.

The allocation is made such that:

- Agent 0 receives items 0 (32) and 5 (75) for a total valuation of 107.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 (92) and 2 (95) for a total valuation of 187.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 (98) and 8 (40) for a total valuation of 138.
- Agent 3 receives items 6 (88) and 1 (20) for a total valuation of 108.
- Agent 4 receives item 7 (95) for a total valuation of 95.

This allocation attempts to create a balance in the distribution of total valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [6, 1],
    "4": [7]
}
```
