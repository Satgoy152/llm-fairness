Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  99  26  73  25  74  75  23  41
1  60  68  79  50   5  75  56  77  91
2  32  32   5  21  82  17  15  19  45
3  80  55   9  75   3  50  86  58  46
4  20  18  62   3  87  20  72  14  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of items among the agents while considering their valuations, we'll aim for an allocation that minimizes envy and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 5 agents, each agent should receive approximately 1 to 2 items.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agents 0 and 1 have higher valuations on most items compared to other agents.
   - Agents 2 and 4 seem to have lower valuations on most items.

2. **Fair Division Approach**:
   - We'll use a simple heuristic approach for this allocation by considering each agent's preferences and trying to minimize envy.
   - Start by allocating the highest valued item to the agent that values it the most, then proceed to the next highest item, and so on.

3. **Allocation Steps**:
   - Assign items based on the highest valuations and distribute items to ensure each agent gets at least one item.
   - Adjust allocations to ensure each agent receives approximately the same number of items.

Given these observations, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Values item 1 highly (99), so allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
  - Also values item 5 highly (74), so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

- **Agent 1**:
  - Values item 8 highly (91), so allocate item 8 to Agent 1.
  - Also values item 7 highly (77), so allocate item 7 to Agent 1.

- **Agent 2**:
  - Values item 4 highly (82), so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

- **Agent 3**:
  - Values item 0 highly (80), so allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
  - Also values item 6 highly (86), so allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

- **Agent 4**:
  - Values item 2 highly (62), so allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
  - Item 3 remains, and Agent 4 values it the least among remaining options, allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and each agent receives approximately an equal share.

Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```
