Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  64  93  81  62  64  60  22  26
1   7  92  12  54  74   2   2  47  76
2  72  97  59  14   9  84  93  18  10
3  40  85  47  46  47  58  23  65  48
4  11  24  48  99  11  64  34  90  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents while considering the concept of envy-freeness, we must aim to allocate items such that each agent values their own allocation at least as much as they value any other agent's allocation. This can be challenging given the constraints of integer allocations and varying valuations.

Let's proceed to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Their highest valuations are for items 2 (93), 3 (81), and 1 (64).
2. **Agent 1**: Their highest valuations are for items 1 (92), 4 (74), and 8 (76).
3. **Agent 2**: Their highest valuations are for items 1 (97), 6 (93), and 5 (84).
4. **Agent 3**: Their highest valuations are for items 1 (85), 5 (58), and 7 (65).
5. **Agent 4**: Their highest valuations are for items 3 (99), 7 (90), and 8 (71).

Given these preferences, a balanced allocation could look like this:

- **Agent 0** gets items 2 and 3.
- **Agent 1** gets items 1 and 4.
- **Agent 2** gets items 5 and 6.
- **Agent 3** gets item 7.
- **Agent 4** gets item 8 and 0.

This allocation attempts to balance the high-valued items across different agents. Now, letâ€™s present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [8, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item (except agent 3, who receives one item) and attempts to maximize the valuations for each agent based on their preferences.
