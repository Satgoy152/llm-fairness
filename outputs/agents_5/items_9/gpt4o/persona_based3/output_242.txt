Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  79  83  95  57  40   8  71  58
1  72  49  30  20  71  40  87  56  56
2  26   1  82  45  34  54  70  30  50
3  39  25  82  13  12  71  19  13  49
4  61  61   9  95  46  90  74   0  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's perceived value of their allocated items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest (95) and has a strong preference for item 0 (84). Allocating these items maximizes their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1** values item 6 the highest (87) and would benefit greatly from having it.
3. **Agent 2** values item 2 (82) and item 5 (54) highly, so allocating them these items increases their utility.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 (71) highly, but since it's already taken, we'll allocate item 8 (49) to maximize their satisfaction.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 (95) highly, but since it's already taken, we'll allocate item 5 (90) and item 6 (74) to maximize their utility.

Given these preferences, here's a fair allocation that attempts to balance the perceived value each agent receives:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items such that their individual valuations are maximized within the constraints of the problem, providing a fair distribution.
