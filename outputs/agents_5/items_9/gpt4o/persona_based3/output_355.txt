Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  55  37  33  96  36  67  28  23
1  24  35  60  60  79  51  55   0  66
2  25  79  31  73  76  83  44   8  77
3  18  45  20  34  62  19  52  97  12
4   3  14  92   7  58  53  57   9  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we will aim to minimize envy and ensure that each agent values their own allocation as fairly as possible. Here is one way to allocate the items using these principles:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 4, 6
   - Total valuation: 96 + 67 = 163

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 2, 3
   - Total valuation: 60 + 60 = 120

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 5, 8
   - Total valuation: 83 + 77 = 160

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item: 7
   - Total valuation: 97

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items: 0, 1
   - Total valuation: 3 + 14 = 17

This allocation tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The allocation aims to reduce envy by assigning higher-valued items to agents who value them the most.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
