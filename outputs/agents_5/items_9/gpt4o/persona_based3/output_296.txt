Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  89  28  79  36  45  53  45  76
1  75  71  60  55  68  15  55  18  48
2  69  37  69  72  41  38  41  16  78
3  15  10   1  19  63  70  36  82  74
4  85  44  19  22  67  17  15  38  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents such that envy-freeness is maximized, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach. This approach aims to maximize the product of the agents' utilities, which often leads to a fair and envy-free allocation.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Calculate the total utility for each agent if they receive no items.**
2. **Greedily assign items to agents in such a way that the product of utilities is maximized.**

Based on the given valuations, here's one possible fair allocation that tries to balance fairness and efficiency:

- **Agent 0:** High values on items 0 and 1
- **Agent 1:** High value on item 2
- **Agent 2:** High value on item 8
- **Agent 3:** High value on item 7
- **Agent 4:** High value on item 4

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3
- Assign item 6 to Agent 3
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2

This allocation attempts to balance the high valuations across agents while ensuring each agent receives some items. It might not be perfectly envy-free, but it should reduce envy significantly.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 7, 8],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and every agent receives at least one item, balancing the high-value items among the agents to reduce potential envy.
