Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19   4  38  58  39  45  20  46  74
1  57  76  46  76   5  40  49   1  51
2  48  34  45  42  72  89  21  86   9
3  22   5  10  24   6  76  52  44  64
4  61   3   0  31  65  92  78  45   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuations to minimize envy and ensure fairness. One popular approach is to use the "Envy-Free up to One Item" (EF1) criterion. This criterion ensures that any agent's perceived value of another's allocation does not exceed their own by more than the value of a single item.

Given the valuations, let's attempt to allocate the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible:

1. **Agent 0's highest-valued items**: 8 (74), 3 (58), 5 (45).
2. **Agent 1's highest-valued items**: 1 (76), 3 (76), 0 (57).
3. **Agent 2's highest-valued items**: 5 (89), 7 (86), 4 (72).
4. **Agent 3's highest-valued items**: 5 (76), 8 (64), 6 (52).
5. **Agent 4's highest-valued items**: 5 (92), 6 (78), 4 (65).

Allocating the items based on these preferences and to ensure no envy:

- Start by giving each agent one of their top preferences if possible.
- Attempt to balance based on total value received by each agent.

Let's try an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [3, 8]
  - Total value for Agent 0: 58 + 74 = 132

- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 1]
  - Total value for Agent 1: 57 + 76 = 133

- **Agent 2**: Items [5, 7]
  - Total value for Agent 2: 89 + 86 = 175

- **Agent 3**: Items [6]
  - Total value for Agent 3: 52

- **Agent 4**: Items [2, 4]
  - Total value for Agent 4: 0 + 65 = 65

This allocation attempts to balance the perceived values across agents and ensures that each agent gets at least one of their top-valued items. The total number of items allocated is 9, with each item being allocated once.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation considers fairness by attempting to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while distributing the items among all agents.
