Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  62  88  75  22  30  99  84  67
1  22  62  41  22  76  68  49   7  59
2  90  81  96   0  32  25  89  95  25
3  45   6  93   4  35  18  86  27  94
4  20  57  98  36  87  61  37  87   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find an allocation of items to agents that is fair and ensures envy-freeness as much as possible given the integer constraint. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer the allocation of another agent over their own.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Determine Total Value for Each Agent**: Calculate the total value each agent assigns to all items. This will help us understand how each agent values the entire set of items.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign items to agents based on maximum individual item valuation to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: Reallocate items if necessary to balance the total valuation for each agent and minimize envy.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**:
   - Agent 0: 34 + 62 + 88 + 75 + 22 + 30 + 99 + 84 + 67 = 561
   - Agent 1: 22 + 62 + 41 + 22 + 76 + 68 + 49 + 7 + 59 = 406
   - Agent 2: 90 + 81 + 96 + 0 + 32 + 25 + 89 + 95 + 25 = 533
   - Agent 3: 45 + 6 + 93 + 4 + 35 + 18 + 86 + 27 + 94 = 408
   - Agent 4: 20 + 57 + 98 + 36 + 87 + 61 + 37 + 87 + 1 = 484

2. **Allocate Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Agent 0: Item 6 (99)
   - Agent 1: Item 4 (76)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (96)
   - Agent 3: Item 8 (94)
   - Agent 4: Item 2 (98) would have been best, but Item 2 is already taken. Next best is Item 8 (87), but that's also taken. So, allocate Item 4 (87).

3. **Reallocate to Ensure All Items are Distributed**:
   - Items left to allocate: 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
   - Agent 0 can also take Item 0 (34) and Item 1 (62) since they value them highly.
   - Agent 1 can take Item 5 (68).
   - Agent 2 can take Item 7 (95).

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: [0, 1, 6]
- Agent 1: [4, 5]
- Agent 2: [2, 7]
- Agent 3: [8]
- Agent 4: [3]

JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 6],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest valuation each agent has for items and tries to distribute items to minimize envy and ensure fairness.
