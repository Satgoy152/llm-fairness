Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  59   7  87  30   4  84  78  97
1  79  70  37  99  43  75  54  81  49
2  67  66   7  53  89  16  44  83  88
3  42   6  22   9   7  83  89   9   1
4   9  34  23  14  52  99  65  59  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering envy-freeness, we need to ensure that each agent perceives their allocation as fair. Envy-freeness means that no agent should prefer another agent's allocation over their own based on their valuations.

Given the valuations matrix, one approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, this might not be balanced, so we may need to make adjustments to ensure each agent has an acceptable share.

Let's first allocate each item to the agent who values it the most and then adjust to achieve a fair distribution:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 79 (Agent 1)
2. Item 1: Highest value is 70 (Agent 1)
3. Item 2: Highest value is 37 (Agent 1)
4. Item 3: Highest value is 99 (Agent 1)
5. Item 4: Highest value is 89 (Agent 2)
6. Item 5: Highest value is 99 (Agent 4)
7. Item 6: Highest value is 89 (Agent 3)
8. Item 7: Highest value is 83 (Agent 2)
9. Item 8: Highest value is 97 (Agent 0)

Initial allocation based on the highest valuation:
- Agent 0: [8]
- Agent 1: [0, 1, 2, 3]
- Agent 2: [4, 7]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [5]

This allocation results in Agent 1 receiving four items, which is not balanced. Let's redistribute some items to make it fairer:

Revised Allocation:
- Agent 0: [8, 0]
- Agent 1: [1, 2]
- Agent 2: [4, 7]
- Agent 3: [6, 3]
- Agent 4: [5]

This ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is equal to 9.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
