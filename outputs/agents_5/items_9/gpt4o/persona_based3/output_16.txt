Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  14  99  85  40  58  43  99  83
1  83  22  18  98   9  58   5  50  93
2  71  72  57  28  79  57  46  47  94
3  98  31  27  85  32  38  12  64  56
4  11  88  59  53   8   3  46  28  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation if possible, or at least a fair division where each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 2, 7, and 3.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 and 8 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 8 and 4.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 0 and 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for item 1.

We'll aim to allocate the items such that the distribution is as fair as possible based on these preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 3, 8
- **Agent 2**: Item 4
- **Agent 3**: Items 0, 5
- **Agent 4**: Items 1, 6

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This distribution aims to respect the preferences of each agent as much as possible given the constraints of integer allocations and the total number of items.
