Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  25  12  38   5  25  37  40  18  25
1  78  97   2  32  52  23  72  75  43
2  42  72  85  72  29  22  87  95   5
3  18  44  44  31  17  16  96  78  20
4  48  13  50  62  98   1  91  36  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to allocate the 9 items to the 5 agents in a way that approaches fairness, considering the agents' valuations. A common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where no agent would prefer the allocation of another agent given their valuations. However, envy-freeness with indivisible goods is not always possible, so we aim to minimize envy as much as possible.

Here is an allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Items with high valuations for Agent 0 are 6 (40), 2 (38), and 5 (37). Assign item 6 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Items with high valuations for Agent 1 are 1 (97), 0 (78), 7 (75), and 6 (72). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Items with high valuations for Agent 2 are 6 (87), 7 (95), and 2 (85). Assign item 7 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Items with high valuations for Agent 3 are 6 (96), 7 (78), and 8 (20). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Items with high valuations for Agent 4 are 4 (98), 6 (91), and 8 (90). Assign items 4 and 8 to Agent 4.

Now, we have assigned 6 items, and 3 items remain to be distributed. We need to distribute the remaining items while considering the remaining high valuations:

- **Item 0**: High interest for Agent 1 (78), but already has item 1. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: High interest for Agent 0 (38), but already has item 6. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as it has a medium valuation for Agent 0 (37) and low for others.

Finally, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair number of items while maximizing their individual valuations.
