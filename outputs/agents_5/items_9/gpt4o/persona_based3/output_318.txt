Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  55  44  59  56  75  54  61  35
1  35  43  87  85  28  75  41  82  18
2  83  37  87  60  50  57  56  23  48
3   1  57  13  77  63  69  96  67  33
4  38  65  39  97  82  37  52  65  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the aim of minimizing envy, we can use a simple algorithm known as the "round-robin" or "sequential allocation" method. The idea is to allocate items one by one to each agent in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction at each step. Here's how you can proceed:

1. **Step 1: Start the allocation process**
   - Create a list of items and track which have been allocated.
   - Initialize the allocations for each agent as an empty list.

2. **Step 2: Allocate items based on highest value to each agent**
   - In each round, allow each agent to choose the item that they value the most among the remaining items.
   - Remove the chosen item from the available pool once it has been allocated to an agent.

3. **Step 3: Repeat the allocation process until all items are allocated**

Following this method, here's how the allocation can be done:

- Agent 0 will first pick item 5 (value 75).
- Agent 1 will pick item 2 (value 87).
- Agent 2 will pick item 0 (value 83).
- Agent 3 will pick item 6 (value 96).
- Agent 4 will pick item 3 (value 97).

For the second round of allocation:

- Agent 0 will pick item 3 (value 59).
- Agent 1 will pick item 7 (value 82).
- Agent 2 will pick item 4 (value 50).
- Agent 4 will pick item 1 (value 65).

These allocations ensure that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences, and the envy is minimized across all agents. 

The allocations in the requested JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
