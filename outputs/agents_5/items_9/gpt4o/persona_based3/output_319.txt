Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  56  26  12  73  55  93  58   2
1   5  17  99  48  35  37  68  62  64
2  32  38  22  22  93  86  52  98  79
3   6  71  81  96  59  57   3  79  37
4  20  61  36  91  12  74  62  98  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents while considering their valuations, we aim for an envy-free allocation. An envy-free allocation ensures that no agent prefers another agent's allocation over their own. Given that each agent must receive an integer number of items and the total number of items is 9, we'll proceed with a strategy that tries to balance the total value each agent receives.

### Allocation Strategy

1. **Calculate Total Value of Items for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0: Values = [20, 56, 26, 12, 73, 55, 93, 58, 2]
   - Agent 1: Values = [5, 17, 99, 48, 35, 37, 68, 62, 64]
   - Agent 2: Values = [32, 38, 22, 22, 93, 86, 52, 98, 79]
   - Agent 3: Values = [6, 71, 81, 96, 59, 57, 3, 79, 37]
   - Agent 4: Values = [20, 61, 36, 91, 12, 74, 62, 98, 86]

2. **Allocate Items Based on Maximizing Individual Preferences:**
   - Start by assigning items to the agent that values them most, while ensuring a fair distribution.

3. **Allocate Items:**

   - Item 0: Allocated to Agent 2 (values: 32)
   - Item 1: Allocated to Agent 3 (values: 71)
   - Item 2: Allocated to Agent 1 (values: 99)
   - Item 3: Allocated to Agent 3 (values: 96)
   - Item 4: Allocated to Agent 0 (values: 73)
   - Item 5: Allocated to Agent 4 (values: 74)
   - Item 6: Allocated to Agent 0 (values: 93)
   - Item 7: Allocated to Agent 2 (values: 98)
   - Item 8: Allocated to Agent 4 (values: 86)

### Final Allocation

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share based on their preferences for specific items. The distribution also ensures that each agent receives valuable items according to their valuation.

```json
{
    "0": [4, 6],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [5, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and attempts to provide each agent with items they highly value, thereby reducing potential envy.
