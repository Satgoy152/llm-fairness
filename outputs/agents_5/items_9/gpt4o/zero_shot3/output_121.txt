Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  63  26  78  27  13  87  23   9
1  56  99  30  46  20  44  31  19  30
2   0  12  32  39  92  96  23  71  44
3  15  90  41  41  99  77  10  24  63
4  86  46   5  74  45  13  60  98   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
The goal is to fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents based on their valuations. To achieve this, we can use a strategy where we assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Identify the highest value an agent has for any item and allocate that item to that agent.
2. Repeat the process for the next highest available item values until all items are allocated.
3. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item by making adjustments if necessary.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 6 (87).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (99).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (96).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4 (99).
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 7 (98).

Now, we'll allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Already has item 6. Next highest valuation is item 3 (78).
- Agent 1: Already has item 1. Next highest valuation is item 0 (56).
- Agent 2: Already has item 5. Next highest valuation is item 4 (92), but it's taken, so next is item 8 (44).
- Agent 3: Already has item 4. Next highest valuation is item 1 (90), but it's taken, so next is item 8 (63).
- Agent 4: Already has item 7. Next highest valuation is item 0 (86), but it's taken, so next is item 3 (74).

After this allocation, items 2 and 3 are left. Let's distribute them to maximize fairness:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (valued at 30).
- Agent 3 can take item 8 (valued at 63).

Finally, ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [1, 0, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [7]
}
```

All 9 items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item.
