Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  32  37  73  37  41  30  95  82
1  39  31  47   8  13  56  99  59  42
2  59  81  14  82  78  33  18  78  17
3  13  53   3  12   5  92  50  23  97
4  42  61  18  47  37  69  45  32  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to balance total valuations across all agents, ensuring each agent receives a roughly equal share of the total value. Let's consider allocating items by selecting the highest-value items for each agent in a manner that aims to equalize the total value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Allocate items to agents such that the total value of items each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Using the table provided, a feasible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 5
- Agent 1: Items 6
- Agent 2: Items 3, 7
- Agent 3: Items 8
- Agent 4: Items 1, 2

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution attempts to balance the total valuation across agents.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation assigns all 9 items, ensuring each agent receives items while attempting to maintain a fair distribution of total valuation.
