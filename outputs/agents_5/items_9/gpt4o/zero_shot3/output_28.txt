Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  52  16  37  94  47  56   2  42
1  64  31  11   2  17  65  45  41  24
2  69  37  15   9  73  82  32  59  44
3  19  57  69  77  23  52  33  77  45
4  70  25  42  65  51  76   6  86  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to analyze the valuations and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences. The goal is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Agent 0:** Has high values on items 4 and 1. Let's assign them item 4 to maximize their high valuation.
2. **Agent 1:** Has the highest value for item 0. Let's assign them item 0.
3. **Agent 2:** Has high values for items 5 and 0, but item 0 is already taken. Let's assign them item 5.
4. **Agent 3:** Has the highest value for item 3. Let's assign them item 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Has the highest value for item 7. Let's assign them item 7.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items: 1, 2, 6, 8.

- **For item 1:** Agent 0 has the highest value. Let's reassign item 1 to Agent 0.
- **For item 2:** Agent 3 has the highest value. Let's assign item 2 to Agent 3.
- **For item 6:** Agent 0 has a high value. Let's assign item 6 to Agent 0.
- **For item 8:** Agent 3 has a reasonably high value. Let's assign item 8 to Agent 3.

After this allocation, all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 2, 8],
    "4": [7]
}
```
