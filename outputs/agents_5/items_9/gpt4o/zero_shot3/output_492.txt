Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  88  32  83   8  79  28  89  76
1  17  10   4  75  97  11  16  64  15
2  82  41  20  94  84  39  52  66  82
3   2  41  96  57  49   0  73  89  33
4  27  95  94  86  81  56  38  59   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that the total valuations each agent receives are as balanced as possible. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that maximize their valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: Allocate the highest remaining valued items.
3. **Agent 2**: Do the same as above.
4. **Agent 3**: Continue with the same strategy.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate the remaining items.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 (88) and 3 (83) are the highest valuations.
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (97) is the highest remaining valuation.
- **Agent 2**: Items 0 (82) and 8 (82) are the highest remaining valuations.
- **Agent 3**: Item 6 (73) is the highest remaining valuation.
- **Agent 4**: Items 2 (94), 5 (56), and 7 (59) are remaining.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
