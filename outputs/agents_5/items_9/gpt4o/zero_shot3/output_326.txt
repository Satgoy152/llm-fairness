Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  29  67  27  88  85  96   1  73
1  24  14  41  33  95  92  71  92  86
2  18  43  17  74  54  20   3  51  93
3  59  97  39  77  50  48  83  85  43
4  11  86  56  79  47  53  78  40  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive. One way to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm that allocates items based on the highest value an agent assigns to any remaining item, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here is a plausible allocation:

1. Start by sorting the items based on the highest individual valuation across all agents.
2. Allocate the highest valued item to the agent who values it the most, if they haven't reached their quota of items.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Following this method, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [2, 0]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives items 6 and 4, which they value highly (96 and 88).
- Agent 1 receives items 5 and 8, where they have high valuations (92 and 86).
- Agent 2 receives item 3, with a valuation of 74.
- Agent 3 receives items 1 and 7, with valuations of 97 and 85.
- Agent 4 receives items 2 and 0, with valuations of 56 and 79.

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item, based on maximizing their satisfaction with the items they value the most.
