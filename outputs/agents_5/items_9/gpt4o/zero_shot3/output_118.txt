Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  41  38  49   7  59  39  47  25
1   2  40  68  37   5  87  69  92  79
2  45  90  58  67  10  55  13  38  34
3  13  86  89  13  85  61  17  49  28
4  15  70  97  90  80  47  39  37  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, the goal is to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations while also distributing all 9 items. This can be approached by attempting to assign each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring that each agent ends up with a reasonable number of items. Given that there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 72 by agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 90 by agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 97 by agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 90 by agent 4.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 85 by agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 87 by agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 69 by agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 92 by agent 1.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 82 by agent 4.

Let's review the allocation to ensure fairness and balance among the agents:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [5, 6, 7]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [2, 3, 8]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and every item is assigned to the agent that values it the most. Now, presenting the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 6, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3, 8]
}
```
