Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  57  22  91  47   3   8  94  99
1  14  88  72   4   1  93   1  77  17
2  36  59  33  28  29  87  68   9  13
3  20  82  90  95  40  50  66  47  74
4  78  87  60  80  60  93  97  18  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider a few factors such as the total number of items, the number of agents, and the valuations each agent places on the items. Since there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. One approach is to ensure that the allocation is as balanced as possible while trying to give each agent items they value highly.

We'll start by calculating which items are valued the most by each agent, and try to distribute the items such that the overall value each agent receives is as fair as possible.

Here's one such allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most, followed by item 8.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 2 can be given item 3.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most.

Following this logic and ensuring each agent gets some items:

- Agent 0: Items 7 and 8
- Agent 1: Items 5
- Agent 2: Items 3
- Agent 3: Items 2 and 4
- Agent 4: Items 0, 1, and 6

This allocation gives each agent a share while trying to maximize their individual valuations. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [0, 1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents.
