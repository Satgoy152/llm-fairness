Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  49   2  23  70  78  24  16  33
1  38  62  15  38   5  60  44  49  59
2  48  57  38  20  59  70  55  60  61
3  22  17  75  81   7  18  72  30  59
4  35  28  38  88   3  43  55   7  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. One approach is to look at the valuations and allocate items to agents based on their preferences, while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Here's a possible allocation plan:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that this agent values highly. For example, item 4 (70) and item 5 (78) are highly valued by agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Choose items that agent 1 values well. Items 1 (62) and 8 (59) are good choices.
3. **Agent 2**: Focus on items with higher values for agent 2. Items 0 (48) and 6 (55) are suitable.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that agent 3 values highly. Items 2 (75) and 3 (81) stand out.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent can receive item 7 (7), which is less desired by other agents.

By considering these valuations, we can achieve a distribution where each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
