Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  97  18  45  73  64  64  15  90
1   7  73  45  21   2  61  55  31  89
2  13  28   8  45  50  25  35  46  31
3  16  73  85  25  18  84  57   8  94
4  20  85  51  46  99  72  35  50  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy such as maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the valuations, we want to try and distribute the items such that the total value for each agent is as balanced as possible.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 is assigned items [1, 6]
- Agent 1 is assigned items [2, 8]
- Agent 2 is assigned items [3, 7]
- Agent 3 is assigned items [5]
- Agent 4 is assigned items [0, 4]

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items. The allocation attempts to balance the valuation each agent receives.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
