Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  88  47  51  78  18  74  39   1
1  72   2  17  40  21   8  13  60  20
2  34  75   1  40  98  36  46  26  30
3  13  80  88  54  13  12  78  73  29
4  90  33  94  30  63  21  62  91  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations for the items. A common approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Start by assigning the highest-valued item for each agent.
2. Continue allocating items that maximize the remaining agents' valuations, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's execute this process:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most (88), so assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most (72), so assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most (98), so assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the most (88), so assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 7 the most (91), so assign item 7 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. Let's allocate the remaining 4 items:

6. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 6 (74), so assign item 6 to agent 0.
7. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3 (54), so assign item 3 to agent 3.
8. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 5 (21), so assign item 5 to agent 4.
9. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 8 (20), so assign item 8 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and we have allocated all 9 items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [7, 5]
}
```
