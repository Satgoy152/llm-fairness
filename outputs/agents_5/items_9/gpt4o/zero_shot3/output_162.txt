Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  43  70  48  32  75   6  15  40
1  13  33  55  70  33  56  11  29  95
2  33  63  66  66  50  52  57   1  42
3  69  55  38  73  31  34  48  20  35
4  40  59  73  32  28  81  60  12  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach to achieve this is by using a greedy allocation strategy, where we allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations. We can start by assigning each item to the agent that values it the most. Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Examine each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most:

   - Item 0: Highest value is 69 by Agent 3.
   - Item 1: Highest value is 63 by Agent 2.
   - Item 2: Highest value is 73 by Agent 4.
   - Item 3: Highest value is 73 by Agent 3.
   - Item 4: Highest value is 50 by Agent 2.
   - Item 5: Highest value is 81 by Agent 4.
   - Item 6: Highest value is 60 by Agent 4.
   - Item 7: Highest value is 29 by Agent 1.
   - Item 8: Highest value is 95 by Agent 1.

2. After initial allocation, ensure each agent gets at least one item:

   - Agent 0 currently has no items. Since Agent 0 has the second-highest valuation for Item 1, we can reallocate Item 1 from Agent 2 to Agent 0.

3. Verify that all items are allocated and adjust if necessary:

   - Agent 3: [0, 3]
   - Agent 2: [4]
   - Agent 4: [2, 5, 6]
   - Agent 1: [7, 8]
   - Agent 0: [1]

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [2, 5, 6]
}
```
