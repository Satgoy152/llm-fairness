Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  92  69  16  21  63  53  81   4
1  95  79  85  78  47  12  77  45  66
2  81  90  74  91  21  55  55   6  85
3  35  30  78  22   2  28   2  50   1
4  40  76  54  89  53  93  90  21  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we aim to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's start by identifying the highest valuations for each item and use those to guide our allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 95 by Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 92 by Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 85 by Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 91 by Agent 2.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 53 by Agent 4.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 93 by Agent 4.
7. Item 6: Highest value is 90 by Agent 4.
8. Item 7: Highest value is 81 by Agent 0.
9. Item 8: Highest value is 85 by Agent 2.

Based on these highest valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 7]
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 2]
- Agent 2 gets items [3, 8]
- Agent 3 gets no items []
- Agent 4 gets items [4, 5, 6]

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are distributed. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4, 5, 6]
}
```
