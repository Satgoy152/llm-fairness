Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  85  65   7   5  51  43  98  35
1  58  26  18   4  70  69  96  65  76
2  50  21  27  51  21  77   0  18  84
3  77  96  92  28  24  93  79  50  33
4  76  27  90  49  53  81  35  23  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuation of the items and tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest values are for items 1 (85) and 7 (98).
   - Allocate items 1 and 7 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values are for items 6 (96) and 4 (70).
   - Allocate items 6 and 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is for item 8 (84).
   - Allocate item 8 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values are for items 5 (93), 0 (77), and 2 (92).
   - Allocate items 5, 0, and 2 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value is for item 3 (49).
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent's highest-valued items are allocated to them, maximizing the total value for each agent as possible. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [5, 0, 2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

In this allocation, all 9 items are assigned, and each agent receives at least one item, except for agent 2, who receives the item they value the most.
