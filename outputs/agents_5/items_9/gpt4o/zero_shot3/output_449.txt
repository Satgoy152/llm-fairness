Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  43  47  16  37  82  81  20  80
1  89  60  62   4  82  51  41  91  20
2  82  47  98  75  77  77  23  15  32
3  47  14  55  37  75  11  76  56  73
4  27  44  25  73  92  19  71  31  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a possible approach for allocation:

1. Rank each agent's valuation of the items and allocate the highest valued items to each agent.
2. Ensure all items are allocated.

Let's implement this:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most at 82, so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most at 89, so allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most at 98, so allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the most at 76, so allocate item 6 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most at 92, so allocate item 4 to agent 4.

After these initial allocations, we have:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [4]

Remaining items: 1, 3, 7, 8

Allocate the remaining items considering the next highest valuations:

- Agent 1 values item 7 the most after item 0, so allocate item 7 to agent 1.
- Agent 3 values item 8 the most after item 6, so allocate item 8 to agent 3.
- Agent 0 values item 1 the most after item 5, so allocate item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most after item 4, so allocate item 3 to agent 4.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [4, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.
