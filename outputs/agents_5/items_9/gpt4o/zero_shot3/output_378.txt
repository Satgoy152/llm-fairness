Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  89  57  22  63  44  68  65  19
1  32  66  49  49   6  34  36  17  30
2  91  65  63  43  67  19  19  92  95
3  20  34  46  68  30  20  75  61  68
4  57  40   4  11  86  50  95  84   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable value based on their preferences. Given that there are 9 items and 5 agents, each agent should ideally receive around 1 to 2 items.

Here is a feasible allocation that attempts to balance the valuations:

1. Agent 0: Items 0 and 6
   - Item 0: Value 94
   - Item 6: Value 68
   - Total value: 162

2. Agent 1: Items 1 and 3
   - Item 1: Value 66
   - Item 3: Value 49
   - Total value: 115

3. Agent 2: Items 7 and 8
   - Item 7: Value 92
   - Item 8: Value 95
   - Total value: 187

4. Agent 3: Item 2
   - Item 2: Value 46
   - Total value: 46

5. Agent 4: Item 4 and 5
   - Item 4: Value 86
   - Item 5: Value 50
   - Total value: 136

Now, letâ€™s present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents, with each agent receiving at least one item according to their preferences, maximizing the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.
