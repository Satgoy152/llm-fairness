Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  36  73  93  91   6  93  88  79
1  95  10  50  35   8  87  23  45  35
2  91  21  18  95  28  51  43  64  76
3  82  71  30  89  46  19  15  53  54
4  29  46  55   1  69  66  66  50  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and exactly 9 items are distributed among all agents.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Sort each agent's valuations** in descending order to determine which items they value the most.
2. **Assign items to agents** by iteratively selecting the highest valued available item for each agent until all items are allocated.
3. **Ensure fairness** by checking that each agent receives at least one item if possible, adjusting the allocation when necessary.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 highly values items: 3 (93), 6 (93), 4 (91), 2 (73), 8 (79)
- Agent 1 highly values items: 0 (95), 5 (87), 2 (50), 7 (45)
- Agent 2 highly values items: 3 (95), 0 (91), 8 (76), 7 (64)
- Agent 3 highly values items: 3 (89), 0 (82), 1 (71), 7 (53)
- Agent 4 highly values items: 4 (69), 5 (66), 6 (66), 2 (55)

**Allocation Plan:**

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest valuation of 95).
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (highest valuation of 95).
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (highest valuation of 71).
4. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (highest valuation of 91).
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (second highest valuation of 87).
6. Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (highest valuation of 66).
7. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (second highest valuation of 64).
8. Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (third highest valuation of 79).
9. Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (second highest valuation of 55).

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 2]
}
```
