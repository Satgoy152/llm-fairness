Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  44  54  26  25  95  39  79  54
1  65  24   1  24  43  33  98  48  32
2  94  12  34  90  23   3  63  30  82
3  28  21  31  12  40  97  71  45  94
4  49  21  87  10  88  43  92  97   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach where we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible). We will consider the valuations provided and try to allocate items in a way that balances the overall satisfaction across agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to each agent to ensure they get their most valued item.

2. Continue allocating the remaining items by considering the highest remaining valuations for each agent, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 5: 95
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 6: 98
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0: 94
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 8: 94
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 7: 97

Now, we have assigned 5 items, one to each agent. We need to allocate the remaining 4 items:

- Agent 0 can also be given item 3 (26), which is among the higher remaining valuations for them.
- Agent 1 can also be given item 4 (43), which is among the higher remaining valuations for them.
- Agent 2 can also be given item 2 (34), which is among the higher remaining valuations for them.
- Agent 3 can also be given item 1 (21), which is among the higher remaining valuations for them.

Now, all items have been allocated, and each agent has at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [8, 1],
    "4": [7]
}
```
