Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  61  71  65   0  94  98  73  12
1  94  35   1  20  33  84   1  95  45
2  87  16   7  41   9  20   6  20  26
3  80  14  50  80  90  91  60  22  90
4  22  55  84   7  83  81  34  63  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are assigned. This process may involve balancing the allocations to ensure fairness and coverage of all items.

Let's analyze the valuations and try to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6.
2. Agent 1 values item 0, 5, and 7 highly.
3. Agent 2 does not have particularly high valuations for any item.
4. Agent 3 values items 0, 3, 4, 5, and 8 highly.
5. Agent 4 values items 2, 4, 5, and 7 highly.

Considering each agent's preferences, let's make an allocation:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0 and 6 (total valuation = 60 + 98 = 158)
- Agent 1: Assign items 5 and 7 (total valuation = 84 + 95 = 179)
- Agent 2: Assign item 8 (total valuation = 26)
- Agent 3: Assign items 3 and 4 (total valuation = 80 + 90 = 170)
- Agent 4: Assign items 1 and 2 (total valuation = 55 + 84 = 139)

Let's summarize these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the allocations are as fair as possible given the valuations.
