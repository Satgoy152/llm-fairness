Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  43  68  49   2  21  70   3  47
1   7  42  68  92  98  12  11  74   8
2  23  17  69  29  85  72  46  76  86
3   0  99   4  13  16  49  78  81   1
4  35  29  97  22   5  60  59  96  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives approximately the same total valuation for their items. We'll aim to maximize the sum of the values for each agent while distributing the items fairly.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 2:
   - Item 0: 93
   - Item 2: 68

2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 3 and 4:
   - Item 3: 92
   - Item 4: 98

3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 7 and 8:
   - Item 7: 76
   - Item 8: 86

4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 1 and 6:
   - Item 1: 99
   - Item 6: 78

5. **Agent 4** has high valuation for item 5:
   - Item 5: 60

Now, let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: [0, 2]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]
- Agent 2: [7, 8]
- Agent 3: [1, 6]
- Agent 4: [5]

The total number of allocated items is 9, and each agent receives items based on their higher valuations.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [5]
}
```
