Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  14  12  36  34  19  36  21  45
1  23  87   7  14  20  15  66  96  89
2  68  59  46  54  38  70  82  94  88
3  40  52  78  29  65  40  61  97   8
4  65  33  68  64  72  34  43  78  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. We will strive to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for the items.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most, followed by other items. We give them item 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1. We allocate item 1 to them.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 the most. We give them item 6.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 7. We allocate item 7 to them.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the most. We give them item 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and 4 remain: items 2, 3, 5, and 8. We will distribute these remaining items based on the next highest valuations:

6. Agent 3 values item 3 highly (29 is highest not assigned), so we give them item 3.
7. Agent 2 values item 8 the second highest (after item 6), so we give them item 8.
8. Agent 1 values item 5 next (after item 1), so we give them item 5.
9. Agent 4 values item 2 next (after item 4), so we give them item 2.

Now all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while attempting to respect their preferences.
