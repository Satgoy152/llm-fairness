Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  14   9   2  77  40  40  52  84
1  84  46  21  97  58  82  48   3  11
2  33  38  17  60  36  79  79  49  77
3  30  11  11  93   5  76  83  15  89
4  71  67  85  69  18  21   5  83  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value of the items. The aim is to distribute the items such that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged based on their own valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Try to give each agent the items they value most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's calculate the total value each agent places on all the items:

- Agent 0: 49 + 14 + 9 + 2 + 77 + 40 + 40 + 52 + 84 = 367
- Agent 1: 84 + 46 + 21 + 97 + 58 + 82 + 48 + 3 + 11 = 450
- Agent 2: 33 + 38 + 17 + 60 + 36 + 79 + 79 + 49 + 77 = 468
- Agent 3: 30 + 11 + 11 + 93 + 5 + 76 + 83 + 15 + 89 = 413
- Agent 4: 71 + 67 + 85 + 69 + 18 + 21 + 5 + 83 + 87 = 506

Now, allocate items by prioritizing the highest value for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the most (84).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (97).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (79).
- Agent 3 values item 8 the most, but it's already assigned; next is item 6 (83).
- Agent 4 values item 8 the most, but it's already assigned; next is item 2 (85).

Based on this prioritization and ensuring all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [3, 1]
- Agent 2: [5, 7]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [0, 2, 8]

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 2, 8]
}
```
