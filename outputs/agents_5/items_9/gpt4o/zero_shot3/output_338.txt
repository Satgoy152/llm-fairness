Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  26  24  13  78  82   1  12   4
1  42  12  78  53  40  19  54  41  56
2   2  37  60  34  44  59  76  88  46
3  69  21  14  77  54  88  39  28  52
4  52  34  82  26  26  76  78  79  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute the items such that the allocation seems balanced in terms of value derived by each agent. We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly at 82, so we can give item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly at 78, so we can give item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 7 highly at 88, so we can give item 7 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly at 77, so we can give item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 8 highly at 98, so we can give item 8 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining 4 items:

- Agent 0 can also take item 4, valued at 78.
- Agent 1 can take item 6, valued at 54.
- Agent 2 can take item 1, valued at 37.
- Agent 3 can take item 0, valued at 69.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item, and we distribute the remaining items to balance the overall valuations.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [7, 1],
    "3": [3, 0],
    "4": [8]
}
```
