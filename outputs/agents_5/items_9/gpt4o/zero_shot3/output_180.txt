Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90  39  70  64  76  97  43  24   2
1  27  77  45   9  40   3  34  53  63
2   5  44  42  82  36  71  95  35  12
3  25  37   3  35  68  81  82  48  55
4  38  89  19  65  48  69  52  25  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. A common method is to maximize the total valuation of all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0** has high value for items 0 and 5, so we assign them those items.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 highly, so we assign item 1 to them.
3. **Agent 2** values item 6 highly, so we assign item 6 to them.
4. **Agent 3** has relatively high valuations for items 3, 4, and 5; however, item 5 is already taken, so we assign item 3 to them.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 relatively highly; since item 4 is not taken, we assign it to them.

Let's now distribute the remaining items:

6. **Agent 1** also values item 8, so we assign item 8 to them.
7. **Agent 3** can receive item 7, which they value moderately.
8. **Agent 4** can receive item 2, which is still available.

The allocation can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 8.
- Agent 2 receives item 6.
- Agent 3 receives items 3 and 7.
- Agent 4 receives items 4 and 2.

This ensures each agent receives items and all items are distributed.
