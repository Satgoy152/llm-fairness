Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  41  70  45  55  78  35  69   6
1  16  99  25  39   8  26  23  85   0
2  77  86  60  53  39  68  78  36  38
3  46  63  74  33  19   1  84   4  50
4  99  36  43  62  94  21  97  55  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, we should consider the valuations of the items by each agent. A common approach is to maximize the total value received by each agent for their allocated items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for any item.
2. Allocate items based on these highest values, ensuring each item is allocated only once.
3. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table and allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 78.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 99.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 77.
- Agent 3 values item 6 the highest at 84.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest at 99, but since item 0 is already allocated, we look for the next highest, item 6 at 97.

After the initial allocation, adjust for any conflicts:

- Both Agents 2 and 4 can't have item 0. Since Agent 4 has the highest value for item 0, allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
- Reassign Agent 2 to another item they value highly. The next highest item for Agent 2 is item 5 at 68, but it's already allocated. Continue the process until finding an unallocated item with a high value.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [5, 7]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [8]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]
- Agent 4: [0, 4, 6]

This ensures each item is allocated, and agents receive items based on their highest valuations where possible.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [0, 4, 6]
}
```
