Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  24   2  30  30  44  27  38  64
1  34  23  67  78  46  21  56  15  95
2  49   4  33  93  61  92  56   4  25
3  94   3  46   0  85  88  55   0  90
4  89   3  24  64  97  61  10  49  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. We'll aim to allocate the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is as balanced as possible based on the valuations.

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Items with moderate to high values for this agent are 7 and 8.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 8. However, Agent 0 already has item 8, so we give Agent 1 the next highest available item, which is item 3.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 4 and 0.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 highly values items 3 and 4, but items 3 and 4 are already allocated, so we assign item 6 to Agent 4.

Now, let's list the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items: 7, 8
- Agent 1 gets items: 3
- Agent 2 gets items: 5
- Agent 3 gets items: 0, 4
- Agent 4 gets items: 1, 2, 6

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [1, 2, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent receives items and that all 9 items are allocated.
