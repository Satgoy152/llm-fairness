Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  50  43  37  79  29  62  51  81
1  29  11  79  76  63   8  37  73  79
2  82  15  82  86  68  68  34  81   6
3  65  69  12  69   4  52  71  69  94
4  27  82  14  72  56  62  29  29  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy considering the given valuations:

1. **Identify Strong Preferences**:
   - Look for high valuation items that stand out for specific agents.
   - Assign these items to the corresponding agents if possible.

2. **Distribute Remaining Items**:
   - Allocate remaining items to balance the total number of items assigned to each agent.
   - Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, depending on strong preferences and valuations.

3. **Final Allocation**:
   - Ensure that all 9 items are allocated.

### Allocation

- **Agent 0** values item 8 the highest.
- **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 2.
- **Agent 2** highly values item 3.
- **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 8, but since item 8 is already considered for agent 0, focus on other high values like item 7.
- **Agent 4** values item 1 the highest.

Considering these strong preferences, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [8]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [1]

Now, assign the remaining items (0, 4, 5, 6):

- Agent 0 can also take item 0, since they have a relatively high value for it.
- Agent 1 can take item 4.
- Agent 2 can take item 5.
- Agent 3 can take item 6.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share considering their preferences and all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [7, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
