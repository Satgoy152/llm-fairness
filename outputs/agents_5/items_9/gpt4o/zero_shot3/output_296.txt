Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  21  66   0  32  61  23   8  76
1  72  38  42  83  87  64  39   2  48
2  49  82  30  70  79  33  94  12  15
3  23  26  75  26  10  56  38  79  79
4  96  67  77  60  92  49  69  83  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share. To achieve this, we can use a greedy approach by allocating items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it highest at 96.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it highest at 82.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it highest at 75.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it highest at 83.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it highest at 87.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it highest at 61.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it highest at 94.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it highest at 79.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it highest at 76.

Now, let's check if each agent has received a fair share. If not, we can adjust the allocation slightly to ensure fairness. We'll aim for each agent to receive approximately 1 or 2 items, given there are 9 items and 5 agents.

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [5, 8]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]
- Agent 2: [1, 6]
- Agent 3: [2, 7]
- Agent 4: [0]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [0]
}
```
