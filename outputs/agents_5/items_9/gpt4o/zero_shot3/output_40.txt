Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  63  21  54  44  58  34  86  30
1  36  38  91  15  53  42  68   9  92
2  78  63  68  91  66  14  68  69  15
3  57  61  98  85  59  40  45   4  78
4  28  26  59  98   5  45  41  39  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy method where each agent is given the item they value the most, one by one, until all items are allocated. This method ensures that each agent gets the items they value highly, to some extent, while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can allocate the items:

1. **Initialization**: Start with no items allocated to any agent.
2. **Iterate Over Items**: For each item, allocate it to the agent who values it the most, provided the agent doesn't already possess the maximum number of items they can hold.
3. **Repeat**: Continue until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this method to the given table.

1. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 2 (78).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (63).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 3 (98).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 4 (98).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 1 (53).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 0 (58).
7. Item 6 is valued highest by Agent 1 (68).
8. Item 7 is valued highest by Agent 0 (86).
9. Item 8 is valued highest by Agent 1 (92).

Based on these allocations, let's ensure that each agent gets a fair share:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 5, 7].
- Agent 1 gets items [4, 6, 8].
- Agent 2 gets item [0].
- Agent 3 gets item [2].
- Agent 4 gets item [3].

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [4, 6, 8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```
