Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  61  89  27  12  53  76  96   1
1  88  91  53  57  43  79  24  49  22
2  28  94  33  32  67  12  46   0  69
3   0  38  84  54  58  66  97  94   3
4   4   1  84  62  77   3  41  36  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Given their high valuation of item 7, it would be beneficial to allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a high valuation for item 1, so item 1 should be allocated to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 should be allocated item 8, which they value highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Since Agent 3 values item 6 the most, allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent should receive item 4 due to its relatively higher value for this agent.

After initial allocations based on high valuations, we need to ensure that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item:

6. **Agent 0**: Add item 0 to Agent 0 to balance the total allocations.
7. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 to improve their overall utility.
8. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2 to Agent 4 to distribute items effectively.
9. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 to complete the allocation.

This allocation respects the constraints and tries to fairly distribute value based on agent preferences.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6, 3],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```
