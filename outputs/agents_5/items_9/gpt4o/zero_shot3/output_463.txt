Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  43  60  29  97  27  91  81  74  90
1  77  69  56  89  58  89  38  31  29
2  58  76  46  22  11  75  52  85   0
3  11  72  18  49   0  49  68  27  74
4  62  84  71  48  33  20  94  78  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. This involves examining which items each agent values the most and ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: For each agent, determine which items they value the most.
2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation**: Start allocating the items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: Make sure all items are allocated and that no agent receives more than a fair share unless it's unavoidable due to the number of items.

Following this approach, we get the following allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (97).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (77).
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (85).
- Agent 3 values item 8 the highest (74).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the highest (94).

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 1: Best valued by Agent 4 (84).
- Item 2: Best valued by Agent 4 (71).
- Item 4: Best valued by Agent 1 (58).
- Item 5: Best valued by Agent 0 (91).

This ensures all items are allocated, with some agents receiving multiple items, based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1, 2, 6]
}
```
