Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  88  77  20  88  87   6  88  17
1  45  77  19  26  82  23   4  14  68
2  62  81   1  83  28  28   8  74  58
3  56  73  21  14  11  25  23  32  76
4  34  14  34  67  23  48  54  63  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and all items are allocated.

Let's go through a potential allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Start by allocating the highest-valued items for each agent. Agent 0 values item 1 the highest with 88. Let's allocate item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 4 the highest with 82. Let's allocate item 4 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the highest with 83. Let's allocate item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 8 the highest with 76. Let's allocate item 8 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 7 the highest with 63. Let's allocate item 7 to agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to maximize the total value for each agent:

6. **Agent 0**: The next highest value for agent 0 is item 0 with 54. Allocate item 0 to agent 0.

7. **Agent 1**: The next highest value for agent 1 is item 8 with 68, but it's already allocated. The next available highest value is item 5 with 23. Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

8. **Agent 2**: The next highest value for agent 2 after item 3 is item 0 with 62, but it's taken. The next available is item 7 with 74, but it's taken. So, it can take item 6 with 8. Allocate item 6 to agent 2.

9. **Agent 3**: The next highest available item for agent 3 is item 5 with 25, but it's taken. Then it can take item 2 with 21. Allocate item 2 to agent 3.

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [8, 2],
    "4": [7]
}
```
