Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  79  73  45  60  90  50  53  75
1  36  80   7  88  98  26  87  54  44
2  51  36  19  98  74  67   2  63  40
3  29  22  64  23  96  92   1  19  71
4  42  51  74  35  17   4  61  52  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we should aim to balance the total valuations each agent receives. Let's start by summing up the values each agent assigns to all items and then try to distribute the items such that the valuation each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Here's the sum of valuations each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: 598
- Agent 1: 520
- Agent 2: 450
- Agent 3: 419
- Agent 4: 369

We will allocate items to balance these sums. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 8 (Valuation: 90 + 75 = 165)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 4, 6 (Valuation: 80 + 98 + 87 = 265)
- Agent 2: Items 3, 7 (Valuation: 98 + 63 = 161)
- Agent 3: Items 2 (Valuation: 64)
- Agent 4: Items 0 (Valuation: 42)

Now let's format this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [1, 4, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives some items, and all items are allocated.
