Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88   3  91  41   2  64  11  74  47
1  39  45  23  59  72  28  18   6  45
2  33  60  59  49  24  64  19  40  31
3  69  87  92  76  65  15  90  96  29
4  24   3  20  40  19  16  83  91  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate each agent's maximum valuation for each item.
2. Prioritize allocating items to the agents who value them the most.
3. Ensure each agent receives a roughly equal number of items, given there are 9 items and 5 agents.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items: 0, 2 (valuations: 88, 91)
- Agent 1 gets items: 4, 8 (valuations: 72, 45)
- Agent 2 gets item: 5 (valuation: 64)
- Agent 3 gets items: 3, 7 (valuations: 76, 96)
- Agent 4 gets items: 1, 6 (valuations: 3, 83)

Each agent gets 1-2 items, and we have ensured all 9 items are allocated.

The JSON representation of this allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```
