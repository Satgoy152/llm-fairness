Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63   6  36  49   6  90  52  38  34
1  25  95  93  28  18   3  67  12  65
2  33  60  46  56  39  43   6  66  50
3  12  48  36  24  23  72  12  85  85
4  64  67  40  78  38  35  83   5  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and aim to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the overall satisfaction and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

- First, identify the items with the highest valuations for each agent and try to assign those items to those agents.
- Ensure that all items are allocated and that the allocation is balanced.

Based on the given valuations, here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for item 5.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 8.
- Agent 3 gets items 7.
- Agent 4 gets items 0, 4, and 6.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation achieves a fairly balanced distribution based on the given valuations.
