Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  68  52  39  25  62  21  13  39
1  82  97  86  19  14  93   5  97  83
2  36   4  94  78  15  49   3  30  32
3  55  53  85  72  25   7  56  27  77
4   4  50  34  44  37  55  41  89  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring each agent can receive an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent:** Start by identifying which items are most valued by each agent. This can help in ensuring that each agent gets at least one item with a relatively high personal valuation.

2. **Allocate based on highest unmet need:** Begin by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most but hasn't been allocated an item yet. This ensures that each agent gets a fair chance at items they value highly.

3. **Distribute remaining items:** Once each agent has at least one item (if possible), distribute the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction across the agents.

Let's apply this strategy to the given valuations:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 0 (75) highly.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 1 (97) and item 7 (97) highly.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 2 (94) highly.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 3 (72) highly.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 7 (89) highly.

Following this logic, we can make an allocation as follows:

1. Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
2. Allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. Allocate item 2 to agent 2.
4. Allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. Allocate item 7 to agent 4.

Now, we have four items left (4, 5, 6, and 8) to be allocated.

6. Allocate item 4 to agent 3 (second highest valuation).
7. Allocate item 5 to agent 1 (high valuation and remaining items).
8. Allocate item 6 to agent 3 (next high valuation).
9. Allocate item 8 to agent 0 (next high valuation).

This allocation ensures each agent receives items based on their valuation preferences while distributing all 9 items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 4, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
