Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  67  42  25  80  32  76  12  88
1  65  43  70  34   9  17   6   0  61
2  83  52  25   5   6  34  50  47   3
3  82  30  29  60  92  12  56  87  61
4  58  85  18  25  67  22  32  83  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 9 items and 5 agents, at least 4 agents will receive 2 items, and one agent will receive 1 item. We attempt to balance the valuations across the agents.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 4 and 8.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0, but since agent 1 has already been allocated item 0, agent 2 can take item 6.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 3 and 7.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 1 and 7, but item 7 is already allocated, so agent 4 will take item 5.

Based on the above considerations, here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 8
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7
- Agent 4: Items 1, 5

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed while aiming for a fair distribution based on the given valuations.
