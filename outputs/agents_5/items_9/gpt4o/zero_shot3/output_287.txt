Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  80  92  46  64  96  71  85  55
1  12  35  79  70  13  16  86   2  39
2  51  77  45  99  98  80  15  50  34
3  72   5  26  91  26  66  31  63  37
4  37  32  96  19  44  34  89  91  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total of allocated items is 9. The allocation should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's find an allocation that distributes the items fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 5. Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 0, as it's the highest among those.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 6. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most. Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the most, but it's already allocated. The next highest is item 0, so allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 2. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 4 more items, ensuring no agent is left without an item and maximizing their respective values.

6. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 1 to Agent 0; it's the next highest valued item for them.

7. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 8 to Agent 1; it's the next highest valued item for them.

8. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 4 to Agent 2; it's the next highest valued item for them.

9. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 7 to Agent 3; it's the next highest valued item for them.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation considers both fairness and maximizing each agent's value based on their preferences.
