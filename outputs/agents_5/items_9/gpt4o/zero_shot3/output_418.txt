Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  68   8  96  21   0  75  46  13
1  94  79  37  25  46  45  95  77  71
2  83  18  72  46  21  38  78  89  44
3  47  52  97  39   8  46  16   6  63
4  45  19  62  76  63  56  45  43  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize individual satisfaction by considering the highest valuations each agent has for the items. We'll try to distribute the items so that each agent gets at least one item they value highly.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuation is highest for item 3 (96).
2. **Agent 1**: Valuation is highest for item 0 (94).
3. **Agent 2**: Valuation is highest for item 7 (89).
4. **Agent 3**: Valuation is highest for item 2 (97).
5. **Agent 4**: Valuation is highest for item 3 (76) (but item 3 is already taken).

We proceed by assigning remaining items based on the next highest valuations that haven't been claimed yet:

- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (valuation 95), since Agent 1 values it highly and item 0 is already taken.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (valuation 63), the next highest unclaimed item for Agent 4.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (valuation 46), the next highest unclaimed item for Agent 3.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (valuation 13), since their highest remaining unclaimed item.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (valuation 18), since their highest remaining unclaimed item.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [7, 1],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
