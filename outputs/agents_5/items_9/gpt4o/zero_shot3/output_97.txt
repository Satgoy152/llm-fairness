Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  98  55  99  91  71  75  49  22
1  94   2  51  30  51  52  98  14  61
2  35  12  61  58  86  81  85  57  33
3  75  93  93  23  39  33  77  53  16
4  78  48  77   9  30  32  39  43  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 1 (98), Item 4 (91)
   - Allocation: Items [3, 1, 4]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations after Agent 0's allocation: Item 6 (98), Item 0 (94)
   - Allocation: Items [6, 0]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations after previous allocations: Item 5 (81)
   - Allocation: Item [5]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations after previous allocations: Item 2 (93)
   - Allocation: Item [2]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Remaining items: Item 8 (69)
   - Allocation: Item [8]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their highest valuations. The JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1, 4],
    "1": [6, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8]
}
```
