Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  98  78  19  80  77  78  63  70
1  47   7  22  44  52  27  19   9  99
2  94  49  10  11  13  40  11  18  82
3  48  93  54  28  70  14  18  24  25
4  38  51  29  57  63  13  45  31  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to assign items to agents in such a way that each agent gets a relatively fair share of their valued items. We'll ensure that all 9 items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 1 the most (98), followed by item 0 (54).
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 8 the most (99), followed by item 4 (52).
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 0 the most (94), followed by item 8 (82).
4. **Agent 3**: They value item 1 the most (93), followed by item 4 (70).
5. **Agent 4**: They value item 8 the most (84), followed by item 4 (63).

To distribute fairly, we will give preference to agents based on their highest valuations and ensure no conflicts occur by looking at the second-highest valuations if necessary.

Allocation Strategy:
- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 8.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.
- Agent 4 gets item 7.

After initial high-value allocations, allocate remaining items:
- Agent 0 additionally receives item 5.
- Agent 1 additionally receives item 3.
- Agent 2 additionally receives item 6.
- Agent 3 additionally receives item 2.

Now let's check:
- All agents have items.
- Only 9 items are allocated in total.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [8, 3],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [4, 2],
    "4": [7]
}
```
