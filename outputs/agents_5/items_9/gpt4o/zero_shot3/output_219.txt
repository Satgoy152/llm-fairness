Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  94  22  70  62  27  48  63  82
1  13  15  28  74   1  26  29  79  99
2  88  11  79  96  36  66  78   3  45
3  48  81  62  90  59  51  48  14  63
4  68  74  22  66   4  32  18  81  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that each agent receives items they value highly, if possible, and ensure that all 9 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 1 (94) and 8 (82). 
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 8 (99) and 7 (79).
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values items 3 (96) and 0 (88).
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values items 3 (90) and 1 (81).
5. **Agent 4**: This agent highly values items 8 (90) and 7 (81).

To avoid conflicts and ensure fair distribution, let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 6 (94, 48)
- **Agent 1**: Item 8 (99)
- **Agent 2**: Items 3 and 0 (96, 88)
- **Agent 3**: Item 5 (51)
- **Agent 4**: Items 7, 4, and 2 (81, 4, 22)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value, and all 9 items are allocated among the agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7, 4, 2]
}
```
