Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  60  97  63  27  35  34  40  56
1  11  91  11   9  26   8  73  99  14
2  90  78  97  21  45  36  50  69  65
3   9  82   2  19  29  42  31  74  54
4  81  12  73  55  69  64  60  70  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can utilize a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations. We'll go through each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no agent gets more than their fair share of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are highest for items 2 (97), 0 (86), and 1 (60).
2. **Agent 1**: Valuations are highest for items 7 (99), 1 (91), and 6 (73).
3. **Agent 2**: Valuations are highest for items 2 (97), 0 (90), and 8 (65).
4. **Agent 3**: Valuations are highest for items 1 (82), 7 (74), and 5 (42).
5. **Agent 4**: Valuations are highest for items 8 (88), 4 (69), and 7 (70).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2, allocated to Agent 2.
- Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 1, allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0, allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 4, allocated to Agent 4.
- Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 4, allocated to Agent 4.
- Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 3, allocated to Agent 3.
- Item 6 has the highest value for Agent 1, allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 7 has the highest value for Agent 1, allocated to Agent 1.
- Item 8 has the highest value for Agent 4, allocated to Agent 4.

Reviewing the allocation, Agent 4 has 3 items, Agent 1 has 3 items, Agent 2 has 1 item, Agent 0 has 1 item, and Agent 3 has 1 item. This ensures each agent has a fair share, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 6, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring a fair distribution among all agents.
