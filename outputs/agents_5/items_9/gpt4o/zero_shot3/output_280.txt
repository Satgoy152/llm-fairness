Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  85  81   1  75  57  24  51  10
1  31  87  97  64  41  69  12  68  42
2  28  72  18   7  64  25  74  91  28
3  82  75  19  55  45  41  78  79  71
4   7  19  95  72   0   4  20  56  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, one common approach is the "max-min" strategy. This strategy maximizes the minimum value each agent receives, aiming for a fair distribution of items.

Let's proceed with assigning items:

1. **Agent 0**: Best items based on valuation are 1, 2, and 4. However, since we need a balanced distribution, let's assign:
   - Item 1 (85)
   - Item 4 (75)

2. **Agent 1**: High valuations are for items 2 and 1. Allocate:
   - Item 2 (97)
   - Item 7 (68)

3. **Agent 2**: Best item is 7. Allocate:
   - Item 7 (91)
   - Item 6 (74)

4. **Agent 3**: Best items include 0, 7, and 6. Allocate:
   - Item 0 (82)
   - Item 8 (71)

5. **Agent 4**: Best item is 2. Allocate:
   - Item 3 (72)

Now, we should verify that each agent gets a fair number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the items are fairly distributed according to their valuations.
