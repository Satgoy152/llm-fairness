Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  93  92  11  54  87  49  67  39
1  98  31  67   1  35  74  44  79  28
2  69  74  85  23  69  71  29  62  52
3  32   8  26   0  17  31   1  35  87
4  37  70  66  54  43  82  37  54  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: Look for each agent's highest valuations to ensure they get one or more items they value highly.

2. **Balance Allocations**: Ensure that each agent receives a fair number of items, considering their valuations.

3. **Check Total Items**: Ensure all 9 items are allocated and no agent receives more than their fair share based on their valuations.

Given the table, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 0, 1, 2.
- **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 0, but it's already taken. Next high is item 7.
- **Agent 2**: High valuations for items 2 and 1, but these are taken. Next high is item 5.
- **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 8.
- **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 5, but it's taken. Next high is item 1, but it's taken. Next is item 4.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 1: Items [7]
- Agent 2: Items [5]
- Agent 3: Items [8]
- Agent 4: Items [2, 3, 4, 6]

The allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed, and each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [2, 3, 4, 6]
}
```
