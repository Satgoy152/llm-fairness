Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  72  19  73  14  86  71  58  94
1  23  17  37  75  59  43  53  74  98
2  76  85  89  58  67  51  28  83  46
3  59  34  46  73  26  14  54  55  22
4   7  71  57  65  45  87  15  65   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We'll try to distribute the items in such a way that each agent's valuation for their allocated items is as high as possible.

Let's review the table of valuations and make allocations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 5, and 8.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3, 7, and 8.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1, 2, and 7.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 6.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 1, 5, and 7.

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Item 8 has the highest valuation by Agent 1, so allocate item 8 to Agent 1.
2. Item 5 has a high valuation by Agent 0, so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
3. Item 3 has a high valuation by both Agents 0 and 1, but Agent 0 has the highest valuation for it, so allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
4. Item 1 has a high valuation by Agent 2, so allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
5. Item 2 has the highest valuation by Agent 2, so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
6. Item 7 has high valuations by Agents 1 and 2, but Agent 2 has the highest valuation for it, so allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
7. Item 0 has a high valuation by Agent 3, so allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
8. Item 4 has a reasonable valuation by Agent 1, so allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
9. Item 6 has a high valuation by Agent 0, so allocate item 6 to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 6],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [1, 2, 7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and the agents maximize their valuations based on the given table.
