Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  75  56  37   7  81  10  68  14
1  84  56  78  65  92  62  13  37  78
2  27  45  85  67   3  82  36  30  58
3  53  49  49   1  73  88  45  99  59
4  47  25  13  82   1  45  79  82  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets as close to an equal share of the total valuation as possible. Here's one way to allocate the items to achieve a fair distribution:

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent:**

   - Agent 0: 65 + 75 + 56 + 37 + 7 + 81 + 10 + 68 + 14 = 413
   - Agent 1: 84 + 56 + 78 + 65 + 92 + 62 + 13 + 37 + 78 = 565
   - Agent 2: 27 + 45 + 85 + 67 + 3 + 82 + 36 + 30 + 58 = 433
   - Agent 3: 53 + 49 + 49 + 1 + 73 + 88 + 45 + 99 + 59 = 516
   - Agent 4: 47 + 25 + 13 + 82 + 1 + 45 + 79 + 82 + 56 = 430

2. **Assign Items Based on Valuations:**

   - Assign items to maximize the individual agent's total value while ensuring fairness in distribution.

3. **Allocation:**

   - **Agent 0:** Items [0, 5]
     - Values: 65, 81 (Total: 146)
   - **Agent 1:** Items [4, 2]
     - Values: 92, 78 (Total: 170)
   - **Agent 2:** Items [6, 3]
     - Values: 36, 67 (Total: 103)
   - **Agent 3:** Items [7, 8]
     - Values: 99, 59 (Total: 158)
   - **Agent 4:** Items [1]
     - Values: 25 (Total: 25)

4. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:**

   - Total items allocated: 9 items
   - Each item is allocated exactly once.

### JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a way that approximates fairness, based on their valuations and the total available value from all items.
