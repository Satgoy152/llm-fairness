Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  97  41  90  24  54  19  88  25
1  87  29  53   7   3  66  31  10  65
2  15  43  92  10  59  61  29  15  17
3  56   5  79  45  46  64  31  67  27
4  13  82  92  10  39   6  87  26  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach of maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's begin by examining the highest valuations for each item and assigning them to the respective agents. This greedy approach will work well given the constraints of the problem.

1. Identify the agent with the highest valuation for each item.
2. Allocate the item to that agent if it hasn't already been assigned.
3. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

### Allocation Process:

- **Item 0**: Highest value (91) by Agent 0.
- **Item 1**: Highest value (97) by Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Highest value (92) by Agent 2.
- **Item 3**: Highest value (90) by Agent 0.
- **Item 4**: Highest value (59) by Agent 2.
- **Item 5**: Highest value (66) by Agent 1.
- **Item 6**: Highest value (87) by Agent 4.
- **Item 7**: Highest value (88) by Agent 0.
- **Item 8**: Highest value (65) by Agent 1.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [5, 8]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 3: Items []
- Agent 4: Items [6]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6]
}
```
