Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  56  93  37  88  32  61  64  89
1  21  27  62  22  19  72  22  91  24
2   0  14  99  97  35  71  36  64  82
3  64   8  35  87  17  70   7  22  16
4  23  50  87  93  70  55  80  34   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of their allocated items while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all nine items are allocated. We'll consider the valuations provided in the table to find an optimized allocation.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 2, who values it the most at 99.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 2, who values it the most at 97.
3. Assign item 4 to agent 0, who values it the most at 88.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 1, who values it the most at 72.
5. Assign item 6 to agent 4, who values it the most at 80.
6. Assign item 8 to agent 0, who values it the most at 89.
7. Assign item 0 to agent 0, who values it highly at 68.
8. Assign item 1 to agent 4, who values it at 50.
9. Assign item 7 to agent 1, who values it the most at 91.

This allocation considers individual item valuations and ensures that the total number of items allocated is 9, with each agent receiving at least one item except agent 3, who receives none.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 8],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```
