Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  44  45  90  76  95   7  20  50
1   5  76  82  69  22  15  33  77  63
2   7  87  88  40  71  35  54  20  91
3  99  78  66  88  76  72  99  40  16
4  90  81  64  36  13  48  60  69  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the total items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution is as even as possible. Given that there are 5 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive 1 item while others will receive 2.

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (95). 
   - We'll allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2 (82).
   - We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 8 (91).
   - We'll allocate item 8 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 (99).
   - We'll allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0 (90), but it's already allocated.
   - The next highest is for item 1 (81).
   - We'll allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now we have 4 items remaining (3, 4, 6, 7) and need to distribute them among the agents, ensuring every agent gets at least one item.

6. **Allocate remaining items**:
   - **Item 3**: Highest unallocated value is for Agent 0 (90). Allocate to Agent 0.
   - **Item 4**: Highest unallocated value is for Agent 3 (76). Allocate to Agent 3.
   - **Item 6**: Highest unallocated value is for Agent 3 (99). Allocate to Agent 3.
   - **Item 7**: Highest unallocated value is for Agent 1 (77). Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [0, 4, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
