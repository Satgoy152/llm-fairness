Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  11  44  97  35   9  66  79  39
1  59  37   2  81  77   7  37  81   5
2  21  41  58  16  87  17  86  90  13
3  42  81  24  21  87  44  39  37  49
4  70  76  23   2  36  50  13  49  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that each agent receives some items based on their preferences, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Given that there are 5 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others.

Here's one possible way to fairly allocate the items:

1. Assign items with the highest value for each agent, ensuring no duplicates.
2. Reassign items if necessary to ensure every item is distributed and the allocations are fair.

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0**: Values are highest for items 3 (97) and 7 (79).
- **Agent 1**: Values are highest for items 3 (81) and 7 (81), but since Agent 0 takes item 3, we assign item 4 (77).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values for items 7 (90) and 4 (87), but since items 4 and 7 are taken, we assign item 6 (86).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values for items 1 (81) and 4 (87), but since item 4 is taken, we assign item 1 (81).
- **Agent 4**: Highest value for item 1 (76), but since item 1 is taken, assign item 8 (63).

### Final Allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items 3 and 7
2. Agent 1: Item 4
3. Agent 2: Item 6
4. Agent 3: Item 1
5. Agent 4: Item 8

Now, we have remaining items 0, 2, and 5. Distribute them to balance the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (additional)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (additional)
- **Agent 4**: Item 5 (additional)

### Final JSON Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [6, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [8, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, with each agent getting a fair share based on their preferences.
