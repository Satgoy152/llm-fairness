Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68   3   6  56  41  71  11  25  10
1  69  71  80  95   1  31  92  78  46
2  24  38  45  54  14  75  30  63  53
3  46  83  19  89  31  96  23   5  21
4  13  28  52  44  11  73   5  43  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a heuristic approach that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Here's one way we could approach the allocation:

1. **Rank Items by Value for Each Agent:**
   - For each agent, rank the items based on their valuation from highest to lowest.
   
2. **Allocate Items:**
   - Start by allocating the highest-valued item for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
   - Continue allocating the next highest value items for each agent, considering that each item can only be allocated to one agent.

Let's perform this allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Items ranked by value: 5 (71), 0 (68), 3 (56), 4 (41), 7 (25), 6 (11), 8 (10), 2 (6), 1 (3).
2. **Agent 1:** Items ranked by value: 3 (95), 2 (80), 1 (71), 7 (78), 6 (92), 8 (46), 5 (31), 0 (69), 4 (1).
3. **Agent 2:** Items ranked by value: 5 (75), 7 (63), 8 (53), 3 (54), 2 (45), 1 (38), 6 (30), 0 (24), 4 (14).
4. **Agent 3:** Items ranked by value: 5 (96), 1 (83), 3 (89), 0 (46), 2 (19), 4 (31), 6 (23), 8 (21), 7 (5).
5. **Agent 4:** Items ranked by value: 8 (90), 5 (73), 2 (52), 3 (44), 7 (43), 1 (28), 0 (13), 4 (11), 6 (5).

**Fair Allocation:**
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 (highest valuation 96).
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation 95).
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1 (highest valuation 80, next after 3).
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 4 (highest valuation 90).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (next highest valuation 83).
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation 68).
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 2 (next highest valuation 63).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest valuation 41).
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1 (next highest valuation 92).

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 6],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 5 agents, respecting the constraint that each agent gets a non-negative integer number of items.
