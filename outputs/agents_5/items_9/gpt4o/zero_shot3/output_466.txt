Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  78  59  97  87  29  80   8  89
1  98   2  33  85  77   0  97  62  44
2   5  50  17  26  28  23  36  60  34
3   0  75  87  79  71  31  63  23  33
4  52  86  47  48  92  23   8   2   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 3, 8, and 1, so those will be allocated to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 6, and 3. Since item 3 is already allocated, Agent 1 will receive items 0 and 6.
3. Agent 2 doesn't have remarkably high valuations for any specific items, but can receive items 2, 5, and 7, which are not allocated yet.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 2, but since it's already allocated, Agent 3 will receive item 4.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4, but since it's already allocated, Agent 4 will receive no items.

Let's allocate the items according to the above reasoning:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 8],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 5, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
