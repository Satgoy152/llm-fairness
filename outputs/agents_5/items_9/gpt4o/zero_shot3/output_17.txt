Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  90  42  37  50  59  43  86  91
1  84   7  97   5  96  34  14   5  84
2  79  82  40  25  91  21  45  96  63
3  87  63  28  53  66  68  66  58  61
4  97  56  79  56  48  76  82   6  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [97 56 79 56 48 76 82  6 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  90  42  37  50  59  43  86  91
1  84   7  97   5  96  34  14   5  84
2  79  82  40  25  91  21  45  96  63
3  87  63  28  53  66  68  66  58  61
4  97  56  79  56  48  76  82   6  34
```

Here's one way to allocate the items to the agents fairly:

1. Agent 0 values item 8 the highest at 91.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest at 97.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 the highest at 96.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 68.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the highest at 97.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:

6. Agent 0 also values item 1 highly at 90.
7. Agent 1 also values item 4 highly at 96.
8. Agent 4 also values item 6 highly at 82.
9. Agent 3 also values item 3 highly at 53.

Based on these allocations, the items can be distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This distribution ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.
