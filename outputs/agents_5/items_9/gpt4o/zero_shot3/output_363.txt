Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30   1  60  43  57  42  87  13  71
1  19   3  30  85  96  81  73   0  37
2  33   0  43  98  40  94  95  17  91
3  38  83  13   3  62   1  94  22  20
4  15  40  87   9  69  16  68  88   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an allocation that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations. Below is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 6 (87) and item 2 (60). 
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 4 (96) and a high value for item 3 (85).
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 3 (98) and item 8 (91).
4. **Agent 3** values item 1 (83) significantly.
5. **Agent 4** values item 7 (88) the most.

Based on these observations, we can assign the items as follows to maximize the agents' valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 6 and 2
- Agent 1: Items 4 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 8
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Items 0, 7, and 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while all items are allocated. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 7, 5]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the condition that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 9 items are fairly distributed among the agents.
