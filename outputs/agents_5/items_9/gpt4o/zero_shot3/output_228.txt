Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  99  51  33  79  60  17  48  93
1  13  84  27  79   8   5   3  44  18
2  54  58   4  99   3  40  36  62   1
3  24  56  61  19  43  79   3  28  41
4  60  18  81  72  56  94  45  43   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Let's consider various strategies such as maximizing individual preferences and evenly distributing the number of items.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 8 (93)
   - Allocate: Items [1, 8]

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuations: Item 3 (79), Item 0 (13)
   - Allocate: Items [3, 0]

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 7 (62)
   - Allocate: Items [7]

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - High valuations: Item 5 (79), Item 2 (61)
   - Allocate: Items [5, 2]

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - High valuations: Item 5 (94), Item 2 (81)
   - Allocate: Items [4, 6]

Let's ensure every agent has an allocation and no items are left unallocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

This way, all 9 items are allocated among the agents.
