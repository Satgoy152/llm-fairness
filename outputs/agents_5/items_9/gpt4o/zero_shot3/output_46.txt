Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  57  68  31   6  82  72  60  86
1  97   2  75  35  25  31  39  68  84
2  40   3  27  19  81  44  68  90  41
3  46  76  85  55  67  57  23  74  77
4  94   6  85  18  73  14  20  54   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items.
3. Make sure all 9 items are allocated fairly.

Let's look at the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (82).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (97).
- Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (90).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (85).
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (94).

Since item 0 cannot be given to both Agent 1 and Agent 4, we check the next highest valued items for these agents and perform a fair distribution:

**Allocations:**

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (value = 97).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (value = 82).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (value = 90).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (value = 85).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (value = 73).

Now distribute the remaining items (1, 3, 6, 8) based on the next highest values:

- Agent 4 also values item 3 highly (18), so assign item 3 to Agent 4.
- Agent 0 values item 8 fairly high (86), so assign item 8 to Agent 0.
- Agent 3 values item 6 fairly high (23), so assign item 6 to Agent 3.
- Agent 2 values item 1 fairly high (3), so assign item 1 to Agent 2.

**Final Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7, 1],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [4, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 9 items distributed.
