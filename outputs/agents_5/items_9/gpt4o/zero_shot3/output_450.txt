Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  86  78  14  87  89  81  10  66
1  50  51  31  22  19  20  91  70  23
2  51   4  92  27   8  26  74  32   1
3  99  93  23  47   6  51   9  11  41
4  79  90  91  78  95  13  23  67  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm. The goal is to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's how we can approach it:

1. **Determine the value of each item for each agent.**
2. **Assign items to the agents based on their highest valuation for an item, while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share.**

Let's go through the process:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most (value = 89).
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most (value = 91).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (value = 92).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most (value = 99).
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (value = 95).

Assign these items first:

- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 6.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.

Next, allocate the remaining items to maximize fairness and ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0 can take item 1 (value = 86).
- Agent 1 can take item 7 (value = 70).
- Agent 2 can take item 3 (value = 27).
- Agent 3 can take item 8 (value = 41).
- Agent 4 can take item 9 (value = 53).

All items are now allocated, with each agent receiving at least one item. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their highest valuation of the items.
