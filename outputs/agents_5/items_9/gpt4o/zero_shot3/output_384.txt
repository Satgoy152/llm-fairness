Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  10  21  11  95  72  48  57  75
1   9  21   4  41  10  61  40  42  37
2  88  14  33  75   5  88  84  21  99
3  34  79  40  15  10  29  31  98  24
4  24  34   7  45  77  85  81  91  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple greedy algorithm to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Here's one approach to do so:

1. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.**
2. **Ensure each agent receives a fair number of items.**

Let's break down the allocation:

- For item 0, agent 2 has the highest value with 88.
- For item 1, agent 3 has the highest value with 79.
- For item 2, agent 2 has the highest value with 33.
- For item 3, agent 2 has the highest value with 75.
- For item 4, agent 0 has the highest value with 95.
- For item 5, agent 0 and agent 2 both value it at 88, but since agent 2 has already received 3 items, agent 0 receives item 5.
- For item 6, agent 2 has the highest value with 84.
- For item 7, agent 3 has the highest value with 98.
- For item 8, agent 2 has the highest value with 99.

Now, let's ensure each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0 receives items: 4, 5
- Agent 1 receives no items.
- Agent 2 receives items: 0, 2, 3, 6, 8
- Agent 3 receives items: 1, 7
- Agent 4 receives no items.

Allocating items 4 and 5 to Agent 0 balances the distribution as Agent 2 received the most items initially and agent 0 has a close valuation for item 5. 

Now, here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 2, 3, 6, 8],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated and attempts to maximize the total value for each agent based on their preferences.
