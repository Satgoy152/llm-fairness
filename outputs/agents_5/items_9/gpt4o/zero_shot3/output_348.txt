Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  11  81  46  18  16   6  76  63
1  59  33  95  77  11  94  33   7   7
2  25  35  51  56  61  32  69  71  13
3  57  90  13  11  98  46  28  38  77
4  57  43  36  58  75  18  77   0   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. We will aim for a balanced distribution where each agent gets approximately the same value from their allocation, considering they have different preferences.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 values item 2 the most (81), we allocate item 2 to them. For balance, we can also give them item 1, which they value moderately (11).
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values item 5 (94) and item 3 (77), so we assign these two items to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 7 the most (71), so we allocate item 7 to them. We can also give them item 4 (61) to balance their allocation.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values item 1 (90) and item 4 (98), but since item 4 is taken, we'll give them item 0 (57) which they value next highest after item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 4 (75) the most, but since item 4 is already assigned, we give them item 6 (77) and item 8 (2), which they value significantly.

Now let's check if all items are allocated and present this in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [7, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and tries to respect the agents' preferences within the constraints given.
