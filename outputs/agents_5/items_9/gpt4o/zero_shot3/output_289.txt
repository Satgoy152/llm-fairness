Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  89  87  92   5   7  48  34  23
1  51  43  91  56  70  81  82  86  17
2  82   7  61   9  70  59  22  57  55
3  84  18  57   2  71  44  33  48  23
4   1  86  40   8  74  11  74  98  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and ensure that each agent gets a reasonably fair share. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Valuation Items for Each Agent:** We will look for items where each agent has relatively high valuations compared to the other agents.

2. **Initial Allocation of High-Valuation Items:** Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that no item is allocated to more than one agent.

3. **Balance the Allocation:** After the initial allocation, if there are remaining items or if some agents have no items, we will reassign or assign some items to balance the allocation.

Let's implement this approach:

### Allocation Steps:

- **Agent 0:** High valuations are for items 3, 1, and 2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** High valuations are for items 2, 6, and 5. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** High valuations are for items 0 and 4. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** High valuations are for items 0 and 4. Since item 0 is already allocated, allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4:** High valuations are for items 7 and 1. Allocate item 7 to Agent 4.

### Remaining Items:

Now, let's look at the remaining items: 1, 5, 6, and 8. We will allocate these to agents with fewer or no items considering their next best valuations.

- **Item 1:** Agent 0 has high valuation. Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- **Item 5:** Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- **Item 6:** Agent 1 also has a high valuation for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 1.
- **Item 8:** Agent 4 has a moderate valuation for item 8. Assign item 8 to Agent 4.

### Final Allocation

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [2, 5, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [7, 8]
}
```

In this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent has received at least one item.
