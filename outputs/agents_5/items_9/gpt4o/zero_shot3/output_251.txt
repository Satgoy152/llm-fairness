Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  86  14  89   6  94  60  35   6
1  79  97   5  60  82   6  21  16  56
2  17  67   5  81  94  22  36  98  71
3  47  31  50  85  55  16  74  26   2
4  18  92  79  72  45  25  69  42   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent gets at least one item. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Identify the Highest Value for Each Item**: For each item, identify which agent values it the most and allocate that item to that agent.

2. **Ensure All Agents Get Allocated Items**: If any agent ends up with no items, we may need to redistribute to ensure every agent has at least one.

3. **Balance the Allocation**: Adjust allocations if any agent has too many items relative to others, ensuring fairness.

Applying this logic to the table, the allocation might proceed as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (79), so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most (97), so allocate to Agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most (79), so allocate to Agent 4.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (89), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (94), so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (94), so allocate to Agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most (74), so allocate to Agent 3.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (98), so allocate to Agent 2.
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most (71), so allocate to Agent 2.

After this initial allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 7, 8]
- Agent 3: Item [6]
- Agent 4: Item [2]

All items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item. Thus, the allocation balances fairness and valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [4, 7, 8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2]
}
```
