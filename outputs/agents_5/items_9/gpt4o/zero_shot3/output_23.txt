Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  33  15  83  40  45  21  73  70
1  69   1  74  29  59  32  62  44  95
2  50  20  67  26  33  57  31  59  56
3  22  41  61  51  12  32  96  39  15
4  49  27  50  50  52  84   2   0  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of agents based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here, we will try to distribute the items considering each agent's preferences.

Let's go through a process to assign items to agents:

1. Assign items to the agent who values them the most if possible, prioritizing items with higher values for each agent.

2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item (if possible), and try to balance the total value of items each agent receives.

### Allocation Process:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 3 (83) and item 7 (73), so we assign those to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 8 (95) and item 2 (74), so we assign those to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** can get item 5 (57) and item 6 (31).
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 6 (96), which has already been assigned, so we look at item 1 (41) for them.
5. **Agent 4** can get item 4 (52).

Now we summarize the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [8, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 4: Item [4]

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated correctly. We still have items 0 and 9, as our indexing mistake led to missing an item. Let's adjust this:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [8, 2]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: Item [1, 0]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 6]

Finally, we have:

- Agent 0: [3, 7]
- Agent 1: [8, 2]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [1, 0]
- Agent 4: [4, 6]

This allocation respects the integer distribution and fairness principle. Now, in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [8, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 0],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
