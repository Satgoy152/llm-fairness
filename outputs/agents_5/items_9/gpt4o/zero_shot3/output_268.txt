Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  86  88  54  82   3  82  95  11
1  86  10  37  38  17  10  46  21  66
2  24  35  94  93  39  93  55  11  50
3  15   4  79  37  20  54  87  81  28
4  86  34  76  51  78   0  91  96  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items. We can do this by allowing each agent to get the item they value the most, iterating through the items, and ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 7 the highest (95), so allocate item 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the highest (86), so allocate item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 2 the highest (94), so allocate item 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 6 the highest (87), so allocate item 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 7 the highest (96), but item 7 is already taken by Agent 0. The next highest valued item is 0 (86), but it is taken by Agent 1. So, allocate item 8, which is the next highest (56).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items. We have items 1, 3, 4, and 5 left. We'll distribute them among the agents, ensuring they receive the next highest valued items still available:

6. **Agent 0**: Next highest available item is 1 (86), allocate item 1.
7. **Agent 1**: Next highest available item is 5 (10), allocate item 5.
8. **Agent 2**: Next highest available item is 3 (93), allocate item 3.
9. **Agent 3**: Next highest available item is 4 (20), allocate item 4.

Thus, we have allocated all items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [6, 4],
    "4": [8]
}
```
