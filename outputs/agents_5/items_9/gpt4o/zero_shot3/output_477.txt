Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  63  27  87  36  70  15  17  60
1  48  53  53  39  52   4  15  66  77
2  65  49  96  84  93   2  57  66  21
3  58  12  46  61  23  12  45  95  75
4  18  19  69  31  26  94  22  87  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the item with the highest value for each agent, to ensure that each agent receives at least one item they value highly.
2. Allocate the remaining items to agents while considering their valuations and ensuring that exactly 9 items are allocated in total.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

### Step 1: Initial Allocation
Allocate the item that each agent values the most:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (Value: 87)
- **Agent 1**: Item 8 (Value: 77)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (Value: 96)
- **Agent 3**: Item 7 (Value: 95)
- **Agent 4**: Item 5 (Value: 94)

### Step 2: Allocate Remaining Items
Allocate the remaining items to maximize individual agent valuations and ensure that all items are distributed:

- Remaining items: 0, 1, 4, 6

Let's allocate these items by checking which agent values them the most without them already having a highly valued item:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (75)
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (63)
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (93)
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (57)

### Final Allocations
With these allocations, all items are distributed, and each agent gets the most valued items possible:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [2, 4, 6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5]
}
```

Here, each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their overall valuation, ensuring fairness while distributing exactly 9 items.
