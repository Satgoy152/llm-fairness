Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71   7  18  35  96  32  23  52  78
1  97  46  65  48   5  41  84  92  60
2  76  77  15  64   6  96  10  39  70
3  47  73  99  46  49  56  67  15  76
4  88   2  66  56   9  74  27  33  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives items with high value to them, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and the total number of items allocated equals 9.

Let's start by calculating the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their preferences:

- Agent 0's total valuation: 71 + 7 + 18 + 35 + 96 + 32 + 23 + 52 + 78 = 412
- Agent 1's total valuation: 97 + 46 + 65 + 48 + 5 + 41 + 84 + 92 + 60 = 538
- Agent 2's total valuation: 76 + 77 + 15 + 64 + 6 + 96 + 10 + 39 + 70 = 453
- Agent 3's total valuation: 47 + 73 + 99 + 46 + 49 + 56 + 67 + 15 + 76 = 528
- Agent 4's total valuation: 88 + 2 + 66 + 56 + 9 + 74 + 27 + 33 + 25 = 380

Now, let's try to allocate items by maximizing individual agent's satisfaction based on their highest valued items, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item when possible:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (96) and 0 (71).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (97) and 6 (84).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (96) and 1 (77).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (99) and 8 (76).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (88) and 5 (74).

Distribute the items by trying to accommodate these preferences while ensuring each agent has at least one item:

1. Agent 0: Assign item 4 (96)
2. Agent 1: Assign item 6 (84)
3. Agent 2: Assign item 5 (96)
4. Agent 3: Assign item 2 (99)
5. Agent 4: Assign item 0 (88)

Now, distribute remaining items:

- Remaining items: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Agent 0: Add item 8 (78)
- Agent 1: Add item 3 (48)
- Agent 2: Add item 1 (77)
- Agent 3: Add item 7 (15)

Here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [5, 1],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all 9 items are allocated.
