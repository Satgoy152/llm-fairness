Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  17  60  61  48  71  68   0  13
1  57  52  87  14  92  50  80  47  12
2  44  94  52  16  68  54  88  60  53
3  55  61  31  97  84  11  26  29  70
4  94  13  18  14  70  30  73  99  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy to ensure each agent gets a reasonably valuable set of items according to their valuations. Given there are 5 agents and 9 items, not every agent will receive the same number of items, but we will aim to distribute the total value fairly.

Let's attempt a round-robin allocation based on each agent's highest-valued items:

1. Agent 0's highest values are for items 5, 6, and 3.
2. Agent 1's highest values are for items 4, 2, and 6.
3. Agent 2's highest values are for items 1, 6, and 4.
4. Agent 3's highest values are for items 3, 4, and 8.
5. Agent 4's highest values are for items 0, 7, and 4.

We can use this information to distribute the items as evenly as possible:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- Agent 1 can take item 2 (second-highest value not yet assigned).
- Agent 3 can take item 8 (next highest valued item).
- Agent 0 can take item 6 (next highest valued item).
- Agent 4 can take item 7 (next highest valued item).

This allocation distributes all items and gives each agent at least one item. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest preferences, as much as possible, given the constraints.
