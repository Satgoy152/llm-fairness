Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  20  66  59  72  22  61  42  76
1  82  24  67  48  45  96  63  74  39
2   3  52  53  52  12  68  12  48   5
3  95  40  85   5  97  30  78  19  72
4  35  45  92  91   6  98  74  11  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [82 24 67 48 45 96 63 74 39]
 [ 3 52 53 52 12 68 12 48  5]
 [95 40 85  5 97 30 78 19 72]
 [35 45 92 91  6 98 74 11 84]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. One potential approach is to try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring fairness in allocation.

Let's analyze the table to make a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values:
   - Highest values: 76 (item 8), 72 (item 4), 66 (item 2)

2. Agent 1 values:
   - Highest values: 96 (item 5), 82 (item 0), 74 (item 7)

3. Agent 2 values:
   - Highest values: 68 (item 5), 53 (item 2), 52 (item 1)

4. Agent 3 values:
   - Highest values: 97 (item 4), 95 (item 0), 85 (item 2)

5. Agent 4 values:
   - Highest values: 98 (item 5), 92 (item 2), 91 (item 3)

Now, let's proceed with the allocation, aiming to give each agent a high-value item and ensuring that all 9 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [8, 0]
- Agent 1: [5, 7]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [2, 3, 6]

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, ensuring fairness across the board.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3, 6]
}
```
