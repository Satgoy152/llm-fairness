Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  29  75  40  61  52  81  59  11
1   5  79  83  67  15   5  40  58  38
2  42  11  17  29   9  95  52  73  57
3  18  30  71  82  44   8  20  34  61
4  41  44  90  26  18  97  90   6  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest values: Item 6 (81), Item 0 (80), Item 2 (75)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest values: Item 2 (83), Item 1 (79), Item 3 (67)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (95), Item 7 (73)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest values: Item 3 (82), Item 8 (61)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest values: Item 5 (97), Item 2 (90), Item 6 (90)

Considering the overlaps and aiming for a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0 gets items:** [0, 6]
- **Agent 1 gets items:** [1]
- **Agent 2 gets items:** [5]
- **Agent 3 gets items:** [3, 8]
- **Agent 4 gets items:** [2, 4, 7]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total allocation sums up to 9 distinct items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [2, 4, 7]
}
```
