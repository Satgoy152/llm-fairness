Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  43   9  89  26  85  11  53  83
1  44  32  51  70  34  97  75  62   3
2  58  59  61  36  35  46  49  93  24
3  32  35   5  92  19  29   6  49  47
4  78  46  18   5  26  85  42  63  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents in such a way that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a method that tries to balance the total value each agent gets from their allocated items. Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

### Allocation Strategy
1. **Agent 0**: Prioritize high-value items for Agent 0. Items 3 and 5 have high valuations.
2. **Agent 1**: Items 5 and 6 are valued highly by Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Items 1 and 7 are valued highly by Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Items 0 and 3 have relatively high values for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Items 0 and 4 can be allocated to Agent 4.

### Allocations
- Agent 0: Items [3, 8] - Total value: 172 (89 + 83)
- Agent 1: Items [5, 6] - Total value: 172 (97 + 75)
- Agent 2: Items [7, 1] - Total value: 152 (93 + 59)
- Agent 3: Item [2] - Total value: 5
- Agent 4: Items [0, 4] - Total value: 104 (78 + 26)

Now, I'll present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [7, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed.
