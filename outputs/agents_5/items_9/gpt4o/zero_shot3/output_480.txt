Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  38  46  80  44  32  69  31  54
1  92  96   7  39  49  47  16   0  59
2  13  72  38  78  47  54  94  21  89
3  11  29  92  24  97  40  81  97  64
4  39   3  78  16  22  33  98  82  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable combination of high and low-valued items. Here is one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value item: 3 (value 80)
   - Allocate: [3]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 1 (value 96), 0 (value 92)
   - Allocate: [0, 1]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: 6 (value 94), 8 (value 89)
   - Allocate: [6, 8]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item: 4 (value 97), 7 (value 97)
   - Allocate: [4, 7]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value item: 2 (value 78)
   - Allocate: [2]

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```
