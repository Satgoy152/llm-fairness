Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82  59  19  43  35   7  84  91  42
1  62  90  20  43  38  14  33  16  24
2  45   9  94   8  99  10  48  13  68
3  68  42  21  98  88  31  59  66  72
4  57  71  98  99  33  95  24  75  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 6, and 7. Allocating item 0 to agent 0 would give them a high-value item.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest. Allocating item 1 to agent 1 makes sense.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has a very high valuation for item 4, so item 4 should be allocated to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3, which should be allocated to them.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 has a high valuation for items 2, 3, and 5. Since item 3 is already allocated, we can give item 2 to agent 4.

Now, let's distribute the remaining items (5, 6, 7, 8):

- **Item 5**: 
  - Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 5, so it makes sense to allocate item 5 to agent 4.

- **Item 6**: 
  - Agent 0 values item 6 highly, so allocate item 6 to agent 0.

- **Item 7**:
  - Agent 3 has a high valuation of 66 for item 7, and since item 7 hasn't been allocated yet, it can be given to agent 3.

- **Item 8**:
  - Agent 4 values item 8 highly, so it can be allocated to agent 4.

After this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item with some agents getting more based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [2, 5, 8]
}
```
