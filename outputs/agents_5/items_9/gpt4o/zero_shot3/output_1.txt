Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  57   2  48  70  55  67  55  18
1  46  92  95  59  57  60  51  98  98
2  52  31  64  94   4  47  82  11  85
3  88  93  12  91  43  42  68  14  44
4  59  90   8  94  62  75  94  84  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and ensure that all items are allocated. We aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share, taking into account their valuations.

Let's analyze the situation and distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuations are generally lower compared to others. We can allocate items that this agent values relatively higher than others.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 1, 2, 7, and 8. We can focus on these items for this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: Shows high valuation for item 6 and 8.
4. **Agent 3**: Shows high valuation for items 0, 1, 3, 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Shows high valuation for items 3, 5, 6, 7.

Considering the above, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value: 14)
- **Agent 1**: Item 1 (value: 92), Item 8 (value: 98)
- **Agent 2**: Item 6 (value: 82)
- **Agent 3**: Item 3 (value: 91), Item 4 (value: 43)
- **Agent 4**: Item 2 (value: 8), Item 5 (value: 75), Item 7 (value: 84)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [2, 5, 7]
}
```
