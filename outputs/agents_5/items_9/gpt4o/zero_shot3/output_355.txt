Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  26  14  97  80  16  67   7  98
1  52  33  60  92  44  89  29   5  96
2  14  49  78  82  60  38  79  22   5
3   1  86  62  89  24  84  31  20  61
4   5  12   9  89  31  51   7  94  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items. Hereâ€™s how we can proceed:

1. **Identify the Highest Value for Each Item:**
   - For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Allocate the Items:**
   - Assign each item to the agent who has the highest valuation for it. If there's a tie (two or more agents value the item equally), select one agent arbitrarily or based on a secondary criterion if available.

3. **Check Allocation:**
   - Ensure that every item is assigned exactly once and that the total number of items assigned is 9.

Let's perform the allocation based on these steps:

- **Item 0:** Highest value by Agent 0 (47)
- **Item 1:** Highest value by Agent 3 (86)
- **Item 2:** Highest value by Agent 2 (78)
- **Item 3:** Highest value by Agent 0 (97)
- **Item 4:** Highest value by Agent 0 (80)
- **Item 5:** Highest value by Agent 1 (89)
- **Item 6:** Highest value by Agent 2 (79)
- **Item 7:** Highest value by Agent 4 (94)
- **Item 8:** Highest value by Agent 0 (98)

Now, let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3, 4, 8
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Items 2, 6
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 7

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 4, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.
