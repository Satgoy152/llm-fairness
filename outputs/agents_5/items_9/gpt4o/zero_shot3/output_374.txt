Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  33  17   5  52  96  62  70  40
1  69  33  49  83  89  41  98  34  96
2  64  12  78  50  80   8  98  24  47
3   4  78  87  94  75  39  95  33  30
4   5  63  25  12  66  60  25  73  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction or total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the constraints and the need to allocate exactly 9 items among 5 agents, we can attempt to distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent while keeping the allocations balanced.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items with the highest values for Agent 0 are 5 (96) and 0 (85).
- Agent 1: Items with the highest values for Agent 1 are 6 (98) and 8 (96).
- Agent 2: Items with the highest values for Agent 2 are 6 (98) and 2 (78).
- Agent 3: Items with the highest values for Agent 3 are 3 (94) and 2 (87).
- Agent 4: Items with the highest values for Agent 4 are 7 (73) and 4 (66).

Based on this analysis, the allocation can be organized as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing the total perceived value based on the given valuations.
