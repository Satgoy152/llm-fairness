Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  20   1  81  48  38  25  87  79
1  37  28  11  94  69  26  33  74  88
2  76  91  74  10  77  46  80  50  65
3  17  73  28  66   2  17  42  58  48
4  48  89  34  44  17  58   9  96  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item and the allocation is roughly proportional to their valuations. We’ll try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 0, 3, and 7. Let's allocate items 0 and 7 to maximize their satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 3 and 8. Since item 3 is already taken, we allocate item 8.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has high valuations for items 1 and 6. We can assign item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 1 highly, but since it's already allocated, we can give them item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent highly values item 7, but since it's already allocated, we can give them item 4.

Now we have allocated the items 0, 1, 4, 5, 7, and 8. We need to allocate the remaining items 2, 3, and 6:

1. **Agent 2**: Assign item 6 to agent 2 as they value it highly.
2. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 to agent 3 as they have a relatively high valuation for it.
3. **Agent 4**: Assign item 2 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, ensuring a fair distribution based on their valuations.

Here’s the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This distribution tries to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.
