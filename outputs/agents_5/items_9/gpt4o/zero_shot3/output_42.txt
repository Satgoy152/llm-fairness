Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  63   3  85  20  18  50   1   3
1  71  72  27  56  49  72  60  32  46
2  47  68  68  49  21  15   0  87  15
3  12   3  51  13  67  90   0  19  40
4  94   9  48  38  69  88  97  61  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, if possible. This can be approached by assigning items to agents based on the highest value each agent assigns to them. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 3 (85).
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 1 (72) and item 5 (72).
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 7 (87).
4. **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 4 (67).
5. **Agent 4** has the highest value for item 0 (94) and item 6 (97).

After assigning these items, we need to allocate the remaining items 2 and 8:

- For item 2, agent 2 and agent 3 both have relatively high valuations, but to ensure fairness and distribution, let's assign it to agent 3 who gets another item.
- For item 8, agent 4 has a reasonably high valuation, so let's allocate it to agent 4.

Now, each agent gets an allocation:

- **Agent 0**: item 3
- **Agent 1**: items 1 and 5
- **Agent 2**: item 7
- **Agent 3**: items 2 and 4
- **Agent 4**: items 0, 6, and 8

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [0, 6, 8]
}
```
