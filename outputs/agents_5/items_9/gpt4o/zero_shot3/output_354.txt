Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  57  97  73  47  59  35  57  32
1  16  93  82  58   6  10  27  39  77
2  75   5  24  69  26  62  34  64  53
3  57  82  58  83  13  30  66  68   1
4  27  60  66  94   0  18   8  10  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Let's examine the table and allocate the items step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item is item 2 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item is item 1 (93).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item is item 0 (75).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item is item 3 (83).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item is item 3 (94), but item 3 is already taken, so the next highest is item 2 (66).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items to ensure each agent has at least one item and maximize their valuations:

- Agent 0 also values item 3 (73) and item 5 (59).
- Agent 1 also values item 8 (77).
- Agent 2 can take item 7 (64).
- Agent 4 can take item 8 (53), but item 8 is already taken, so consider item 7 (10).
- Agent 3 can take item 6 (66).

Considering these allocations, we ensure each agent gets at least one item and maximize their total values:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 8]
- Agent 2: Item [0]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 4: Item [7]

This allocation gives each agent one or more items and all items are distributed. Now, let's present the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
