Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  54   3  24  15  93  79   5   8
1  86  23  83  33  78  16  26  56  96
2  81  65   3  59  91  38  98  39  58
3   2  94  14  46  79  84  44  33  93
4  13  69  59  52  22  12  47  31   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. This approach will ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly, leading to a fair distribution.

Hereâ€™s a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [73, 54, 3, 24, 15, 93, 79, 5, 8]
   - Allocate items that Agent 0 values highly: Item 5 (93), Item 0 (73)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [86, 23, 83, 33, 78, 16, 26, 56, 96]
   - Allocate items that Agent 1 values highly: Item 8 (96), Item 0 (86)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [81, 65, 3, 59, 91, 38, 98, 39, 58]
   - Allocate items that Agent 2 values highly: Item 6 (98), Item 4 (91)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: [2, 94, 14, 46, 79, 84, 44, 33, 93]
   - Allocate items that Agent 3 values highly: Item 1 (94), Item 8 (93)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Values: [13, 69, 59, 52, 22, 12, 47, 31, 7]
   - Allocate items that Agent 4 values highly: Item 2 (59)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly while distributing all 9 items fairly.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [8, 3],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation respects the constraint of assigning exactly 9 items in total and ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation preferences.
