Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  76  63  35  45  54  51  76  16
1  24  50  69  22  23  47  79  69  44
2  95  78  94  51  98  75  29  97  42
3  39  13  89  42   2  46  69  17  19
4  70  27  33  10  33  45  38  67  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy algorithm that gives each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.

Following this method, here are the allocations:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it at 95, which is the highest.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 78, which is the highest.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it at 94, which is the highest.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it at 51, which is the highest.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 98, which is the highest.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it at 75, which is the highest.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 79, which is the highest.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it at 97, which is the highest.
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it at 16, which is the highest.

Here's how the allocations look in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
