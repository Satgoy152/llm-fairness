Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  10  28  86  93  57  66  35  41
1  85  50  47  43  18  23  50  26  97
2  22  74  69  43   8  18  46  32   8
3  45  82  24  55  41  36  20  18  49
4  72  85  83  90  74  93  74  40  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction (sum of valuations) across all agents while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. We will analyze the valuations and try to optimize the allocation.

Let's consider the following allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent one item that maximizes their individual valuation.
2. Distribute the remaining items to maximize the overall valuation.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (value 93)
- Agent 1: Item 8 (value 97)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (value 74)
- Agent 3: Item 3 (value 55)
- Agent 4: Items 5 and 6 (values 93 and 74)
- Remaining items to allocate: 0, 2, 7

Now allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (value 34)
- Agent 2: Item 2 (value 69)
- Agent 3: Item 7 (value 18)

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 4, 0
- Agent 1: Item 8
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7
- Agent 4: Items 5, 6

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```
