Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  85   8  20  83  99  54  79  20
1  90  55  38  36  87   9  98  21  59
2  87  16   3  16  24  29  20  29  76
3  28  80  49  15  92  79  50  34  86
4  51  32   5  60  94  79  35  88  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the agents receive items they value highly, and each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 5 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others.

A simple approach is to allocate items based on the highest value each agent assigns to them, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

### Allocation Process

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 90 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 85 by Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 49 by Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 60 by Agent 4.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 94 by Agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 99 by Agent 0.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 98 by Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 88 by Agent 4.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 86 by Agent 3.

Considering the allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 5].
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 6].
- Agent 2 gets no items.
- Agent 3 gets items [2, 8].
- Agent 4 gets items [3, 4, 7].

### JSON Allocation

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated once, and we distribute all 9 items among the agents.
