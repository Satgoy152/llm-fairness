Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12   1  77  21  99  14  78   4  51
1  66  59  39  21  18  61  88  80  73
2  87  18  60  21  72  22  51  55  56
3   6  10  69  59  38  42   6  39  22
4   7  29  55  81  14  77  71  14  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 very highly compared to others, so let's assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 highly, so item 6 goes to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 highly, so item 0 goes to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 highly, so item 3 goes to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 5 highly, so item 5 goes to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0**: Already has item 4, let's allocate item 2 since they value it highly as well.
7. **Agent 1**: Already has item 6, let's allocate item 8 since they have a high valuation for it.
8. **Agent 2**: Already has item 0, let's allocate item 7 since they value it next highest.
9. **Agent 3**: Already has item 3, let's allocate item 1 that they value next highest.

Now each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
