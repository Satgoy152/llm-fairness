Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  90  60  10   6  11  38  10  62
1  41   1  32  42  41  92  63  53  17
2  38  20  49  85   9  77  18  84  99
3  72  61  11  39  56  11  78  25  38
4  72  55  16  83  77  25  83  77  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we should try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets items that they value relatively highly, while ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that considers each agent's highest valued items first, while also ensuring that no items are left unallocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 1 and 0. We allocate items 1 and 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 5. We allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 8. We allocate item 8 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 6. We allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for items 3 and 4. We allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 4.

Now we have allocated 7 items. Two items (2 and 7) are left. We can distribute these based on remaining highest valuations:

- **Agent 2**: Also highly values item 7. We allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 0**: Values item 2 next highest after already allocated items. We allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

Now all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [8, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
