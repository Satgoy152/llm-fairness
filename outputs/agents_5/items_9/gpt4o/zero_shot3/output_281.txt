Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  92  36  89  36  68   6  99  37
1   7  65  99  71  18  62  50  27   8
2  39  31  31  41  98  28  60  43  69
3   7  56  94   9  72  66  34  18  33
4  44  32  47  87  60  73  35  89  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and a total of 9 items are allocated. We can use a simple greedy algorithm to achieve this, by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, and then adjusting if any agent receives too many items.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest value each agent has for the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
2. Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 92.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 89.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 98.
6. Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most at 73.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 60.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.
9. Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most at 69.

Now let's distribute the items to ensure each agent gets at least some items:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 3, 7]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Items [4, 6, 8]
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Item [5]

This allocation results in a total of 9 items being distributed. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 6, 8],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5]
}
```
