Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  46  55  27  70  38  84  14  57
1  16  50   5  24  89  99  52  98  76
2  66  99  93   1  22  66  16  61  88
3  15  28  76  38  27  10  72  12  15
4  47  52  31   3  25  20  10  51  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We'll start by allocating items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation that achieves fairness:

1. Identify the highest value for each item and assign the item to the corresponding agent.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item by adjusting the allocations if necessary.
3. Check that all items are allocated and no item is given to more than one agent.

Following these steps, here is a fair allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value (66) by Agent 2
- Item 1: Highest value (99) by Agent 2
- Item 2: Highest value (76) by Agent 3
- Item 3: Highest value (27) by Agent 0
- Item 4: Highest value (89) by Agent 1
- Item 5: Highest value (99) by Agent 1
- Item 6: Highest value (84) by Agent 0
- Item 7: Highest value (98) by Agent 1
- Item 8: Highest value (88) by Agent 2

We can adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item, given the constraints:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 6
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5, 7
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 8
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item (none, since allocations are based on maximizing value and all items are allocated already)

Here's the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 5, 7],
    "2": [0, 1, 8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```
