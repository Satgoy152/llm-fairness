Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  34  48  18  71  13   6  71  98
1  10  11  28  57  71  91  66  73  56
2  57  36  39  59  93  12  35  80  92
3  88  26  26  94  47   1  62  74  60
4   9  98  87  19  55  39  59  33  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets at least one item, as there are 9 items and 5 agents. We'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while distributing the items fairly among them.

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing the value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Items with the highest values for Agent 0 are 8 (98), 4 (71), and 7 (71). To ensure fairness, let's allocate items 8 and 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Items with the highest values for Agent 1 are 5 (91) and 7 (73). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Items with the highest values for Agent 2 are 4 (93) and 8 (92). Since item 4 is already allocated, allocate item 8 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Item with the highest value for Agent 3 is 3 (94). Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 1 (98). Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, we have distributed 5 items, and 4 remain to be allocated. We need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total valuation.

6. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 2 (48) to Agent 0 to increase their total valuation.
7. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 6 (66) to Agent 1.
8. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 7 (80) to Agent 2.
9. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 0 (88) to Agent 3.

With this allocation, all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
