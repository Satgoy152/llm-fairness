Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  25  62  91   0  66  61   4  75
1   1   6  14   1  21  74  53   0  61
2   2  49  73   1  80  35  92  75  85
3   2  74  80  58  72  38  51  71  81
4  92  20  47  29  20  14  28  22  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed. We'll consider the valuations of each agent and try to distribute the items in a way that leads to the most balanced outcome. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 3 the most (value of 91). Let's give them item 3.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 5 the most (value of 74). Let's give them item 5.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 6 the most (value of 92). Let's give them item 6.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 2 the most (value of 80). Let's give them item 2.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 0 the most (value of 92). Let's give them item 0.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining 4 items (1, 4, 7, and 8):

6. **Agent 0:** Next highest value is item 8 (value of 75). Let's give them item 8.
7. **Agent 3:** Next highest value is item 1 (value of 74). Let's give them item 1.
8. **Agent 4:** Next highest value is item 4 (value of 20). Let's give them item 4.
9. **Agent 2:** Next highest value is item 7 (value of 75). Let's give them item 7.

This allocation considers the highest valuations first and tries to ensure each agent has at least one item. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2, 1],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
