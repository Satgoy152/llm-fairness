Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19   1  88  70  12  34  68   1  57
1  30  80  79  60  90  85  81  30  26
2  88  70  19  26  61  18  34  12  81
3  59  34  16  84  96  76  92  71   7
4  59  91   9   7   3  28  64  21  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach to maximize overall satisfaction. One way to do this is to allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:** Go through each item and identify which agent values it the most.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust to ensure fairness:** If some agents end up with no items or if the allocation can be improved for overall fairness, make adjustments while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Following these steps, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items they value highly but not the highest among all (items 2, 6).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most, so they get item 4.
- Agent 2 values items 0 and 8 highly, so they get items 0 and 8.
- Agent 3 values items 3, 5, and 7 most highly, so they get these items.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most, so they get item 1.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [3, 5, 7],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
