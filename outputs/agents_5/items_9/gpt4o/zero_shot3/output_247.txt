Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  37  81  57  61  78  79  10  89
1  52  78  14  79  64  52  15  50  24
2   6  10  10  54  45  35   9   9  38
3  99  29  66  75  53  68  85  70   7
4  90  15  77  33  49  69  13   4  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can consider maximizing the sum of values each agent receives. This can be approached as a type of assignment problem where we try to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This will ensure that each item is allocated to the agent who gains the most value from it.
2. Adjust any allocations if necessary to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Based on the table provided, here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (99), so assign item 0 to agent 3.
- Item 1: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (78), so assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (81), so assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Item 3: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (79), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Item 4: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (64), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (78), so assign item 5 to agent 0.
- Item 6: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (85), so assign item 6 to agent 3.
- Item 7: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (70), so assign item 7 to agent 3.
- Item 8: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (89), so assign item 8 to agent 0.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 5, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 2: No items assigned yet. To ensure fairness, we need to adjust allocations. Let's assign item 4 from agent 1 to agent 2 (as agent 2 values it at 45, which is reasonably high).
- Agent 3: Items [0, 6, 7]
- Agent 4: No items assigned yet. To ensure fairness, we need to adjust allocations. Let's assign item 8 from agent 0 to agent 4 (as agent 4 values it at 80, which is reasonably high).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 6, 7]
- Agent 4: Item [8]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 6, 7],
    "4": [8]
}
```
