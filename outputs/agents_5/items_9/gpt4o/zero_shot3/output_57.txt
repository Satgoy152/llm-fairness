Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  51   0  52  55   8   1  23   0
1  10  32  14  71  14  66   4   9  31
2  53  30  50  23  96  92  47  69  17
3  52  78   2  86  86  45  56  33  95
4   3  81  97   1  12  15  54  53  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Choose the items that yield the highest valuation for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Choose items such that Agent 1's overall valuation is maximized without overlapping with Agent 0's allocation.
3. **Agent 2**: Follow a similar strategy to maximize Agent 2's valuation.
4. **Agent 3**: Continue with the remaining items to maximize Agent 3's valuation.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate any remaining items to Agent 4.

Now, let's look at a possible allocation based on the given table:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 3 and 5.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 4, 5, and 6.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1, 3, and 8.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 2 and 8.

After considering the various high valuations and ensuring all items are allocated, here's one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 3
- **Agent 1**: Items 5 and 8
- **Agent 2**: Items 4 and 6
- **Agent 3**: Items 1
- **Agent 4**: Items 2 and 7

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 7]
}
```
