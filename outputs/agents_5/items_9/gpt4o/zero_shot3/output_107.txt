Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  54   8  12  48  74  12  44  60
1  98  41  71  42  27  28  72  64  61
2   9  27  94  45  96  18  84  92  14
3  60  72  40  58  40   6  80  16  13
4  86  21  27  97  84  61   3  69  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation of the items. Here's one way to approach this allocation problem:

1. **Identify Key Valuations:** Start by looking at the highest valuations each agent has for the items, as this might indicate their preferences.

2. **Distribute Items Based on Preferences:** Attempt to distribute items so that each agent gets items they highly value.

3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated:** Make sure the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

4. **Check Fairness:** Ensure that the allocation is as fair as possible, considering the valuations.

Here is a suggested allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Gets items [0, 5] because they have high valuations (57 and 74 respectively).
- **Agent 1:** Gets items [1, 6] due to high valuations (41 and 72).
- **Agent 2:** Gets items [2, 4] given high valuations (94 and 96).
- **Agent 3:** Gets item [3] due to the relatively higher valuation compared to other items.
- **Agent 4:** Gets items [7, 8] as they have reasonably high valuations (69 and 87).

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets items that they value relatively higher, maintaining fairness to a reasonable extent.
