Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  99  86  68  79  81  59   1   9
1  87  62  60   3  66  25  97  69  36
2  10  40  24  38  33  43  45   6  51
3  13  88  40  72  51  79  83  92  50
4  91  87  63  21   7  81  83  95  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. Our goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives a share that reflects their preferences, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: Item 1 (99), Item 0 (85), Item 2 (86)
   - Allocation: [0, 1]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: Item 6 (97), Item 0 (87), Item 1 (62)
   - Allocation: [6]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: Item 5 (43), Item 8 (51)
   - Allocation: [8]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: Item 7 (92), Item 1 (88), Item 5 (79)
   - Allocation: [7]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - High valuations: Item 7 (95), Item 0 (91), Item 1 (87)
   - Allocation: [2, 3, 4, 5]

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, respecting their preferences as much as possible. The allocations are based on the highest values each agent assigns to the items, ensuring a fair distribution according to their indicated valuations.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [2, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
