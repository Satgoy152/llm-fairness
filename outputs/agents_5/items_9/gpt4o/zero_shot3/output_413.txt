Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85  61  56  67  15  19  57  83  75
1  27  52   1  55  62  84  17  49  86
2  33   7  58  57  70  51  30  93  54
3  30  55  34   9  72  97  37  41  55
4  31  20   7  81  65  84  13  62  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated. Here's one possible fair allocation, balancing the total valuations:

1. **Allocate the items to each agent**:

   - Agent 0: Items [0, 7]
   - Agent 1: Items [8]
   - Agent 2: Items [3, 6]
   - Agent 3: Items [5]
   - Agent 4: Items [1, 2, 4]

2. **Check total allocations**:

   - Agent 0: Values = 85 (Item 0) + 83 (Item 7) = 168
   - Agent 1: Values = 86 (Item 8)
   - Agent 2: Values = 57 (Item 3) + 30 (Item 6) = 87
   - Agent 3: Values = 97 (Item 5)
   - Agent 4: Values = 20 (Item 1) + 7 (Item 2) + 65 (Item 4) = 92

This allocation ensures each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while distributing all items.

3. **Final JSON format**:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 2, 4]
}
```

In this allocation, all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents, with an attempt to balance the total value received by each agent.
