Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  88  81  95  33  86  18  46   5
1   2  51  98  68  94   8  19  22  67
2  48  57  18  48  58  49  92  88  89
3   6  99  37  44  13  49  25  44  40
4  90  61  88  53  54  32  21  53  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item until all items are allocated. Below is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Preferences**: We start by identifying which items each agent values most. We can do this by listing the items in descending order of value for each agent.

2. **Initial Assignment**: We will give each agent one of their most valued items if possible, ensuring no item is double-allocated.

3. **Iterate Until All Items Are Assigned**: After each agent has at least one item, we will distribute the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction, meaning we continue to assign items based on the highest remaining valuations.

4. **Final Allocation**: Ensure all 9 items are allocated and each agent has an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

### Allocation Process:

- **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 3 (95) and 1 (88).
- **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 2 (98) and 4 (94).
- **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 6 (92) and 8 (89).
- **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 1 (99) and 3 (44).
- **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 0 (90) and 2 (88).

### Iterative Allocation:
1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 6 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, 4 more items (4, 5, 7, 8) need to be allocated. We'll continue by considering the next highest valuations:

6. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (next highest value after item 2).
7. Assign item 8 to Agent 2 (next highest value after item 6).
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (next highest value after item 0).
9. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value after item 3).

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
