Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  20  35  34  91  11  33  52  62
1  68  36  64  35  44  99  38  67  47
2  10  97   7  63  74  79  71  67  44
3  39  52  72  41  85  46  89  58  28
4  56   8  62  41  89  35  63  40  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4. Assign items 0 and 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 3. Assign items 1 and 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 6. Assign item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 has high valuations for items 2, 7, and 8. Assign items 2, 7, and 8 to Agent 4.

After allocating the items, we ensure that each agent has an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations, ensuring that all items are distributed.
