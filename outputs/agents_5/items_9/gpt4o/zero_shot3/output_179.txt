Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  15  54  62  32  39  16  96  91
1  69  76  70  87  44  52  90  66  82
2   5  58  78  83  95  57  80  59  21
3  31  96  64  24  90  87  21  49  75
4  90  35  25  80  97  24  47  91  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that the items are distributed such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. One approach is to assign items to agents based on maximizing their total valuations.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign items to each agent considering their highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Ensure the total number of items allocated is 9.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 7 (96).
- Agent 1: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 3 (87).
- Agent 2: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 4 (95).
- Agent 3: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 1 (96).
- Agent 4: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 4 (97). Since item 4 is already assigned to Agent 2, we consider the next highest, which is item 3 (80).

Now let's assign the remaining items to maximize the total valuation:

- Agent 0: Item 6 (16) and item 8 (91) are available. Agent 0 values item 8 the most among the remaining items.
- Agent 1: Item 0 (69) and item 2 (70) are available. Agent 1 values item 0 the most among the remaining items.
- Agent 2: Item 5 (57) is available. Agent 2 values item 5 the most among the remaining items.
- Agent 3: Item 2 (64) is available. Agent 3 values item 2 the most among the remaining items.
- Agent 4: Item 6 (47) is available. Agent 4 values item 6 the most among the remaining items.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [6]
}
```
