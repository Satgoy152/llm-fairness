Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  39   7   7   6  67  14  59  22
1  61  71  51  83  43   0  79  62  42
2  14   5  36  59  79  17  65  50  84
3  69  73  56  77  55  93  35  43  77
4  45  10   1  42  95  34  51  59   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Initial Allocations**: Start by giving each agent one item that they value the most, ensuring that no two agents receive the same item initially.
2. **Remaining Allocations**: Allocate the remaining items by considering which agent values them the most, while trying to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 5 (value: 67).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 3 (value: 83).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 8 (value: 84).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 5, but since it's already allocated, the next highest is item 3, which is also allocated, so we move to item 1 (value: 73).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 4 (value: 95).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 61.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it next at 56.
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it at 79.
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it at 59.

Now, we have allocated all 9 items. Each agent has at least one item. Hereâ€™s the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [3, 0, 6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
