Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  84  59  77  41  35  18  49  45
1  91  51  11  11  14   3   8  47  54
2  23  18  39  66  83  17  55  70  64
3  98  54  34  26   3  59  75  62  32
4  81  76  25  36  82  73  50  12  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible. One approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 1 (value 84), 3 (value 77)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 0 (value 91)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 4 (value 83), 8 (value 64)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: 2 (value 34), 6 (value 75)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items: 5 (value 73), 7 (value 12)

This allocation ensures each agent gets items while trying to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their valuation. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item.
