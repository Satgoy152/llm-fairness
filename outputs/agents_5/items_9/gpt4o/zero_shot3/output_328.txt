Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  20  85  82  13  95  55  29  91
1  58   7  73  17  54  22  36  80  33
2  30  81  32  60  55  40  88  70  88
3  57  31  11  43  85  83  32  51  97
4  71  85   5  95  23   6  86  42   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we must ensure that each item is assigned to exactly one agent, and each agent may end up with zero or more items. Our goal is to distribute the items such that the allocation is as fair as possible based on the valuations provided.

One common method to achieve a fair allocation is to use the concept of maximizing the total valuation or ensuring each agent gets items they value relatively highly. Given the valuations, let's create an allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no two agents receive the same item.

Here is one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it at 71
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it at 85
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 85
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it at 95
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it at 85
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 95
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 88
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it at 80
- Item 8: Agent 3 values it at 97

Based on the above item-to-agent assignments, the allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [0, 1, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all 9 items are distributed among the agents.
