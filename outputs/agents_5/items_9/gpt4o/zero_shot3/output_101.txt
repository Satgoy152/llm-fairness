Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60   6  92   3  66   8  57   4  18
1  85  89  48  39   7  76  39  23  82
2   6  44  93  43   1  91  29  22  65
3  71  28  28  72  31  30  23  82  97
4  52  63  92  57   6  87  36  71  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the 9 items based on the valuations provided, ensuring each agent receives a reasonable share according to their preferences. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 2, and 4.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 2 values items 2 and 5 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 8 highly.
- Agent 4 values items 5 and 7.

We need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation is fair based on their highest valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (value 60)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (value 89)
- Agent 2: Items 2 and 5 (values 93 and 91, respectively)
- Agent 3: Items 3 and 8 (values 72 and 97, respectively)
- Agent 4: Items 4, 6, and 7 (values 6, 36, and 71, respectively)

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value relatively high compared to others. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [4, 6, 7]
}
```
