Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  46  73  27  14  27  36  72  11
1  96  73  25  13  44  70  47  44  44
2  41  61   1   3  75  28  90  57  69
3  23  10  88  74  99  76  13  72  29
4   4  49  87  66  63  24  26  69  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. A common approach is to ensure each agent gets a near-equal share of the total valuation, considering the constraints of integer allocation.

Let's break down the allocation step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Total Valuations**: 
   Each agent's total valuation for all items combined is calculated as follows:

   - Agent 0: 46 + 46 + 73 + 27 + 14 + 27 + 36 + 72 + 11 = 352
   - Agent 1: 96 + 73 + 25 + 13 + 44 + 70 + 47 + 44 + 44 = 456
   - Agent 2: 41 + 61 + 1 + 3 + 75 + 28 + 90 + 57 + 69 = 425
   - Agent 3: 23 + 10 + 88 + 74 + 99 + 76 + 13 + 72 + 29 = 484
   - Agent 4: 4 + 49 + 87 + 66 + 63 + 24 + 26 + 69 + 80 = 468

2. **Allocate Items**: 
   We will allocate items based on descending order of individual valuations, ensuring each agent gets a fair chance to claim high-value items. The goal is to maximize the total individual value while distributing items fairly.

3. **Perform Allocation**:
   - Agent 1 gets item 0 (value 96) and item 5 (value 70).
   - Agent 3 gets item 4 (value 99) and item 2 (value 88).
   - Agent 2 gets item 6 (value 90) and item 8 (value 69).
   - Agent 0 gets item 7 (value 72).
   - Agent 4 gets item 3 (value 66).

4. **Final Allocation**:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [4, 2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items while maximizing their individual valuation based on the items they value most.
