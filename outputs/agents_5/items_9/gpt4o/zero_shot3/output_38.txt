Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  95   5  35  44  12  64  98  68
1  44  44  59  43  57   4  96   7  37
2  32  52  25  98  91  28  42  17  29
3  30  82  34  61  78  63  43  30  28
4  87  21  96  48  41  31  77  44  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for an equitable distribution that respects the preferences of each agent. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution of items.

Let's start by analyzing the highest valuations for each agent and try to distribute the items accordingly. We will ensure that every agent receives at least one item where possible, while trying to maximize their total value.

Here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 7.
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 6 and 2.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 5.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 0 and 8.

Let's allocate the items based on the above analysis:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [6, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 8]
}
```

Explanation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 7 for a total valuation of 95 + 98 = 193.
- Agent 1 receives items 6 and 2 for a total valuation of 96 + 59 = 155.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 4 for a total valuation of 98 + 91 = 189.
- Agent 3 receives item 5 with a valuation of 63.
- Agent 4 receives items 0 and 8 for a total valuation of 87 + 52 = 139.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item based on their highest valuations.
