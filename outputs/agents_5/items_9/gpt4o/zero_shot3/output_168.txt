Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  26  39  68  48  70  24  36  78
1  70  27   5  12  50  98  91  15  83
2  21  52  41  81  86   4  55  68   9
3  19  56  95  33  73  11  93   7  74
4  26  92  54  66   5  22  44  44  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. Given the data, we can use a method similar to the Hungarian algorithm or a greedy approach to make allocations that seek to maximize the total utility.

However, for simplicity and demonstration purposes, Iâ€™ll use a heuristic approach to allocate items, aiming to give each agent the items they value the most while ensuring each item is distributed.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (70), 3 (68), 8 (78)
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (98), 6 (91), 8 (83)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (86), 3 (81), 7 (68)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (95), 6 (93), 4 (73)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued items: 1 (92), 8 (93), 2 (54)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, let's assign the remaining items using the next highest available values:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (5)
- **Agent 1**: Item 6 (91)
- **Agent 3**: Item 3 (33)
- **Agent 4**: Item 7 (44)

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned and tries to maximize the value for each agent.

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```
