Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  10  38  32  98  30  87  52   7
1  77  59  72  72  74  13   5  22  35
2  56  11  26  91  59  70  86  95  42
3  73  84  80  63  19  23  59  65  93
4  94  78  62  68  73   3  83  88  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value that each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Since there are 5 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others.

Let's consider a strategy where each agent gets at least one item that they value highly. We can attempt to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is maximized. Here’s one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 4 (98), 0 (80)
   - Allocation: [4, 0]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (72), 3 (72)
   - Allocation: [2, 3]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 7 (95), 6 (86)
   - Allocation: [7, 6]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 8 (93)
   - Allocation: [8]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued items: 1 (78), 5 (3)
   - Allocation: [1, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated equals 9. Here’s the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
