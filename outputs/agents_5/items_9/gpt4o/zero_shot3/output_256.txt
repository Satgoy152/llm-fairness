Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  20  72  89  17  28  61  68  79
1  53  86   1  87  22  80   4   4  73
2  94  35  15  71   5  24  43  56  75
3  26  60  21  92  16  21  13  29  38
4  36  61  18  51  88   0  98  29  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One common approach is to allocate items sequentially based on the highest valuation an agent has for an unallocated item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 2 values item 0 the most (94). Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (86). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 0 values item 3 the most (89). Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
4. Agent 4 values item 6 the most (98). Assign item 6 to Agent 4.
5. Agent 0 values item 8 the most (79) among remaining items. Assign item 8 to Agent 0.
6. Agent 1 values item 5 the most (80) among remaining items. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
7. Agent 0 values item 7 the most (68) among remaining items. Assign item 7 to Agent 0.
8. Agent 3 values item 4 the most (16) among remaining items. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
9. Agent 2 values item 2 the most (15) among remaining items. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Here's the resulting allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 8, 7],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their valuations.
