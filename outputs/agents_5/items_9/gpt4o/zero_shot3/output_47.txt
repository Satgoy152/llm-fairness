Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  59  70  82  82  67  46  56  62
1  48  76  94  31  70   0  67  47  62
2  31  31  61  61   7  35  93  78  55
3  41  62  12  90  30  73  96  63  36
4  66  16  72  56  17  63  21  59  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we want to ensure each agent receives some items and the total number of allocated items is exactly 9. One strategy is to maximize the total valuation for the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Look for the highest valuations to assign those items first.
2. Try to distribute items so that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Given the valuations, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 4] (Values: 82, 82)
- Agent 1: Items [2] (Value: 94)
- Agent 2: Items [6] (Value: 93)
- Agent 3: Items [5, 7] (Values: 73, 63)
- Agent 4: Items [0, 1, 8] (Values: 66, 16, 20)

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [0, 1, 8]
}
```
