Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  46  83  21  83   7  45  82  57
1  71  89  21  19   9  98  41  12  71
2  11  54  98  54  70  36  58  82  26
3  32  69  67  67  62  20   3  59  97
4  86  91  60  81  67  87  72  37  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. We'll aim to distribute the items based on the valuations such that each agent receives a fair share, considering their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Allocate item 2 (value 83) and item 4 (value 83). This gives Agent 0 two high-value items.

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Allocate item 5 (value 98) and item 1 (value 89). These are high-value items for Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Allocate item 8 (value 26) and item 7 (value 82). These items are reasonably valued for Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Allocate item 3 (value 67) and item 6 (value 3). This gives Agent 3 a higher-valued item and a lower-valued one.

5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Allocate item 0 (value 86). This is a high-value item for Agent 4.

This allocation distributes a total of 9 items among the agents and aims to balance the values each agent receives.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [8, 7],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
