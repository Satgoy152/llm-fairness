Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  46  46  13  47  89  61   8  20
1  20  55  77  65  60  52  80  75  89
2  82  42  10  84  55  12  78  19  24
3  40   4  89  35   0   3  58  47  59
4  66  16  45  13  17  74   7  34  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. This can be approached using a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuations of each agent.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 5, and 6.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2, 7, and 8.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for items 3 and 6 (though item 6 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we choose item 3).
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 2 and 8 (though both are already allocated to other agents, so we choose item 6).
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 0 and 5 (both already allocated, so we choose item 4).

Using this strategy, here is the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items [0, 5].
- Agent 1 receives items [2, 7, 8].
- Agent 2 receives item [3].
- Agent 3 receives item [6].
- Agent 4 receives item [1].

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 7, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
