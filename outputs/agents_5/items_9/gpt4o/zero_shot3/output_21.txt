Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  42  19  96  68  41  43  53  15
1  66  48  82  55  88  41  52  44  97
2  81  53   7  91  46   4  89  68  61
3  65  26  62  63  62  61  89  48   6
4  92  67  85  22  38  39  55  35  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [92 67 85 22 38 39 55 35 74]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a simple approach by trying to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's the allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation with 92.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation with 67.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation with 85.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation with 96.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation with 88.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation with 41 (tied with Agent 1, but Agent 0 has fewer items assigned so far).
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation with 89.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation with 68.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation with 97.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and agents are assigned items based on their highest valuations. Agent 3 receives no items in this distribution due to their lower relative valuations.
