Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  81  20  17  19  57   2  82  47
1  32  97  20  40   5  37   7  26  86
2  63  70  90  95  28   4  49  66  51
3  47  33  76  76  24  10  62  88  11
4  43  52  61  32  73   3  26  42  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the values each agent assigns to the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 5 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others. Our aim is to distribute the items to maximize total satisfaction while ensuring fairness.

Here's a possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 1 (97). Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
2. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 3 (95). Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.
3. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 7 (88). Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
4. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 7, but it's already taken. The next highest value item is item 1 (81), which is also taken. So, the next is item 8 (47). Allocate item 8 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is item 4 (73). Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.
6. **Agent 2**: The next highest value item for Agent 2 is item 2 (90). Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
7. **Agent 0**: The next highest available item for Agent 0 is item 0 (37). Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
8. **Agent 3**: The next highest available item for Agent 3 is item 6 (62). Allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
9. **Agent 1**: The next highest available item for Agent 1 is item 5 (37). Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [7, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes their individual satisfaction based on the given valuations. There are exactly 9 items allocated.
