Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  67  89  51  17  14  31  57  41
1  41  60  47  38  78  45  45  26   3
2  73  52  84  33  61  36  93  22  32
3  22  10  93  89  79  48  18  50  46
4  22  78   4  35  93  81  79  45  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total satisfaction or valuation for the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most. 
2. If there are ties (multiple agents value an item equally), select based on who has the fewest items so far or randomly if they have the same number of items.

Here's how the allocation might look:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is 73 by agent 2.
- **Item 1**: Highest value is 78 by agent 4.
- **Item 2**: Highest value is 93 by agent 3.
- **Item 3**: Highest value is 89 by agent 3.
- **Item 4**: Highest value is 93 by agent 4.
- **Item 5**: Highest value is 81 by agent 4.
- **Item 6**: Highest value is 93 by agent 2.
- **Item 7**: Highest value is 57 by agent 0.
- **Item 8**: Highest value is 46 by agent 3.

Now let's allocate the items based on the maximum values:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [2, 3, 8],
    "4": [1, 4, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to an agent, and no items are left unallocated. Each agent receives a number of items, though not necessarily the same number.
