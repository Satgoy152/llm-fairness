Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  15  57  50  74  62  10  89  39
1   9  83  43  12  49   9  67  62  98
2  21  64  36  39  84  18  41  96  79
3  13  84  22  54  90  40  89  30  38
4  43  68  15   0  59  69  76  15  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we'll aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives. We'll also ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations and attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - High values: Item 4 (74), Item 7 (89)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High values: Item 8 (98), Item 1 (83)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High values: Item 7 (96), Item 4 (84)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - High values: Item 4 (90), Item 1 (84)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - High values: Item 6 (76), Item 5 (69)

Based on the above analysis, an allocation could be:

- Assign Item 7 to Agent 2 (highest value and unique preference).
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 1 (highest value and unique preference).
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value and unique preference).
- Assign Item 6 and Item 5 to Agent 4 (high values and unique preference).
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 3 (second highest value).
- Assign Item 0 and Item 2 to Agent 0 (remaining items with decent values).
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 (remaining item).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
``` 

This allocation attempts to distribute items such that agents receive items they highly value, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of items based on the valuations.
