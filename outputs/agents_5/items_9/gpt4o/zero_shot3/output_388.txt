Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  16  89  76  36  23  25   3  46
1  53  61   9  97  17  61  96  32  61
2  35  25  28  49  66  94  55   3  82
3   4  33  26  86  70   6  95  39   8
4  37  51  65  36  54  96  68  63  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a portion of the total items based on their preferences. We'll try to maximize the agents' satisfaction by assigning items to agents with higher valuations. 

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest preference for item 2 (value 89) and item 3 (value 76).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest preference for item 3 (value 97) and item 6 (value 96).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest preference for item 5 (value 94) and item 8 (value 82).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest preference for item 6 (value 95) and item 3 (value 86).

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest preference for item 5 (value 96) and item 8 (value 94).

Here's a possible allocation that ensures each agent gets a reasonable distribution of items based on their preferences:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3
- Agent 2: Items 5
- Agent 3: Items 6
- Agent 4: Items 4, 7, 8

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest values for each agent, keeping the distribution as fair as possible while ensuring all 9 items are allocated.
