Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76  99   9  52  11  39  45  48  26
1  59  37  30  22  26  37  33  29  77
2   6  34  95   3  28  76  43  94  62
3  15  59  24  67  87   5  22  81  20
4  42  78  10  29  90  68  28  97  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - There are 5 agents and 9 items, so each agent should ideally receive around 1.8 items.
   - We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, meaning some agents might get 2 items while others get 1 item.

2. **Strategy**:
   - We will assign one item to each agent first, focusing on the item that provides the highest valuation for each agent.
   - After each agent has one item, we'll distribute the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

3. **Allocation Process**:
   - Assign the highest-valued item to each agent.
   - Allocate remaining items to agents based on their second-highest preferences without repeating any item.

4. **Execution**:
   - Agent 0: Highest value is for item 1 (value = 99).
   - Agent 1: Highest value is for item 8 (value = 77).
   - Agent 2: Highest value is for item 2 (value = 95).
   - Agent 3: Highest value is for item 4 (value = 87).
   - Agent 4: Highest value is for item 7 (value = 97).

5. **Remaining Items**: 
   - Items 0, 3, 5, 6, are left.
   - Assign these based on the next highest valuations for the remaining items.

6. **Second Round Allocation**:
   - Agent 0 also gets item 0 (value = 76).
   - Agent 4 also gets item 5 (value = 68).
   - Agent 3 also gets item 3 (value = 67).
   - Agent 2 also gets item 6 (value = 43).

7. **Final Allocation**:
   - Ensure that all items are allocated and no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [7, 5]
}
```
