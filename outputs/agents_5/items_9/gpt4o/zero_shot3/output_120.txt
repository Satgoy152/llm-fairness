Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  17   2  79  11   8  64  71  54
1  94  13  49  98  47  45  78  17  81
2   7  15  25  48  86  48  30   1  73
3  61  26  81  52  64  20  91  46  24
4  42  14  18  45  40   4   8  83  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. This involves assigning items to agents in such a way that each agent is reasonably satisfied with their allocation, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Begin by identifying the item each agent values the most and try to give them that item.
2. Continue allocating the next highest valued item for each agent until all items are distributed.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 3 (79), Item 6 (64)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (94), Item 3 is already taken by Agent 0, so Item 4 (47)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (86) is taken, so Item 8 (73)
- Agent 3: Item 6 (91) is taken, so Item 2 (81)
- Agent 4: Item 7 (83), and Item 5 (4) as a secondary choice

This allocation provides a fair distribution based on each agent's valuation. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7, 5]
}
```
