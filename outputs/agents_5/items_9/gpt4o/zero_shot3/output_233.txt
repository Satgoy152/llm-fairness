Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  44  79  98  60  44  44  64  95
1  55  72  77  16  34  96  19   4   6
2  17   5   9  49  56  57   1  17  59
3  42  61  12  61  39  86   2  37  20
4  25  51  32  47  51  79  27   3   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets, considering each agent's preference. Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, 3, and 8. We'll give them items 0 and 8, which are highly valued by them.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 5. We'll assign item 5 to them.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most. We'll allocate item 4 to them.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 highly, but since it is already allocated, we look at other items. We'll assign item 1 to them.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 highly, but since it is already allocated, we'll assign item 6 to them.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 8
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 6

Now, to allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 7), we consider the remaining high valuations:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 3, so we'll allocate it to them.
- Agent 3 has a next high valuation for item 3, but since it's already allocated, we allocate item 7 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 has a next high valuation for item 2, so we'll allocate it to them.

Final Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 8, 3
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 1, 7
- Agent 4: Items 6, 2

In JSON format, this would look like:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [6, 2]
}
```
