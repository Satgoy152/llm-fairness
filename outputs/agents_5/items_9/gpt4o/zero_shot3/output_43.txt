Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  17  39  38  44  84  28  61  71
1  29   0  10  11  11  62  14  82  79
2  90  88  68  26   6  14  30  96  47
3  84  53  61  98  49  60   6   9  37
4  82   3  19  42  16  43  70  67   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated. We'll aim to distribute the items in a way that each agent gets a reasonable share, considering their preferences.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 5 and other moderately high valuations. We'll allocate items 5 and 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for item 7 and another moderately high valuation. We'll allocate items 7 and 8 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 0 and other moderate valuations. We'll allocate items 1 and 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 3 and 4. We'll allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has a moderate valuation for item 2. We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to an agent, and every agent gets an integer number of items.
