Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  20  49  30  86  45  24  36  53
1  96  87  63  15  69  37   2  15  26
2  48  47  23   4  21  37  78  28   7
3  48  57   3  61   5  98  86  14   2
4  94  44  83  53  77  21   8  48  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations to maximize the total satisfaction. Let's proceed with this method:

1. **Identify High-Value Items**: Assign items to agents who value them the most, reducing the chance of major dissatisfaction.

2. **Ensure Fairness**: Each agent should get at least one item, if possible, to ensure fairness.

3. **Maximize Total Value**: Aim to maximize the total value received by all agents.

Let's allocate based on these principles:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 4 highly (86), and item 2 (49).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 highly (96) and item 1 (87).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 6 highly (78).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 5 highly (98).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 3 highly (53).

After considering the highest value for each agent and ensuring all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [6]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [3, 2, 7, 8]

The allocation strives to maximize the total perceived value while ensuring that each item is allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 2, 7, 8]
}
```
