Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  50  90  70  72  76  99  31  11
1  33  33  60  48  70  34  95   5  92
2  39  91  52  44  26  85  99  42  10
3  55  41  82  15  38  75  10   3  44
4  84  39  65  27  29  23  86  13  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. This involves ensuring each agent gets at least one highly valued item based on their preferences while ensuring that all 9 items are distributed.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued items for Agent 0 are 6, 2, and 5. Agent 0 can be given items 6 and 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**: The highest-valued items for Agent 1 are 6 and 8. Agent 1 can be given items 8 and 4.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest-valued items for Agent 2 are 1, 6, and 5. However, since item 6 is already taken, Agent 2 can receive items 1 and 5.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest-valued items for Agent 3 are 2 and 5. Since item 2 is available, Agent 3 can be given items 2 and 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest-valued items for Agent 4 are 0 and 8. Since item 0 is already taken, Agent 4 can receive item 7.

The allocation can be represented in the specified JSON format as:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [8, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each of the 9 items is distributed among the agents, maximizing the value based on their preferences while ensuring that every agent receives an item.
