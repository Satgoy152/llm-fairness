Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  33  69   5  98  99   7  10  43  11
1  23  13  80  18   2  91   8  15  46
2  97  39   8  69  83  27  35  86   1
3   7  30  37  42  46  71  60  60  63
4  22  35  50  14  94  84  17  47  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. One method to do this is by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since there are only 9 items and 5 agents, some agents may not receive any items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 97 by agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 69 by agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 80 by agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 98 by agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 99 by agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 91 by agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: The highest value is 60 by agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: The highest value is 86 by agent 2.
9. **Item 8**: The highest value is 63 by agent 3.

Now, let's assign the items based on these valuations:

- Agent 0 gets items [1, 3, 4]
- Agent 1 gets items [2, 5]
- Agent 2 gets items [0, 7]
- Agent 3 gets items [6, 8]
- Agent 4 gets no items []

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": []
}
```
