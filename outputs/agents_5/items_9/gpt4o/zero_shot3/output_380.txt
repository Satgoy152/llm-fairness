Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  13  35  34  87  49  79  97  66
1  56  86  79  28  67  87  94  60  51
2  80   0  79  51  64  16  42  53  11
3  24  25  10  27  25  55  41  20  59
4  13  95  86  95  88  56  96  30  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as balanced as possible. A possible way to achieve this is by using a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item until all items are allocated.

Below is a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 7 (value 97) is given to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 6 (value 94) is given to Agent 1.
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0 (value 80) is given to Agent 2.
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 5 (value 55) is given to Agent 3.
   
5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 1 (value 95) is given to Agent 4.
   
6. **Remaining Items**:
   - Assign items to balance the total valuations:
     - Item 3 (value 34) is given to Agent 0.
     - Item 4 (value 67) is given to Agent 1.
     - Item 2 (value 79) is given to Agent 2.
     - Item 8 (value 59) is given to Agent 3.

The allocations ensure that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated. The total valuation for each agent is balanced as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [6, 4],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [5, 8],
    "4": [1]
}
```
