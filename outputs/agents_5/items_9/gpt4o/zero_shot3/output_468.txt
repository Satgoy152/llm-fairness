Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  11  64  38   9  51  78  95  36
1   1  39  87  99  76  44  79  37  46
2  95  26  21  13  15  23  73  84  92
3  20  59  89  71  73   8  53  42  89
4  66  97  70   4  22  13  84  33  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items based on the highest valuations. Let's start by analyzing the valuations and distributing the items to the agents:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (95), Item 0 (86)

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (99), Item 2 (87)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (95), Item 8 (92)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (89), Item 8 (89)

5. Agent 4:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (97), Item 6 (84)

Based on these valuations, we can distribute the items as follows while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and minimizing overlaps:

- Agent 0: Item 7, Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 8
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 1, Item 6

Now, we have allocated 7 items. We need to allocate the remaining 2 items, ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 1: Add Item 4
- Agent 3: Add Item 5

This allocation ensures each agent receives items fairly based on their highest valuations, and all items are distributed.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring fairness among the agents.
