Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  95  47  14  34  61  91  74  29
1  28  75   4  39  87  31  80  21  22
2  49  49  49  28  91   0   5  13  67
3  82  27  76  77  79  66   3  13  17
4  28   7  87  24  64  76  15  87   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and exactly nine items are allocated in total.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total value each agent can achieve from the items they value the most.
2. Assign items such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 6
- Agent 1: Items 4, 0
- Agent 2: Items 8, 3
- Agent 3: Items 2, 5
- Agent 4: Item 7

In JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 6],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [8, 3],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are assigned, and it attempts to distribute the items according to the agents' preferences, balancing their high-value items where possible.
