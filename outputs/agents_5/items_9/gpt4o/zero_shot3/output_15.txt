Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  88  24  66  99  85  29  82  47
1  74  66  91  57  63  68  60  24  79
2  52  31   3  49  93  80  20  24  45
3  32  52  38  99  23  36  51  83   4
4   4  67  69  42  50   4   7  26  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to balance the total value each agent receives. One approach is to allocate items to the agents that value them the most while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Assign high-valued items**: Start by assigning items to the agent that values them the most.
2. **Ensure an integer number of items**: Each agent should receive at least one item, and the total number of items allocated should be 9.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most (67).
- **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most (88).
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most (91).
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most (99).
- **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most (99).
- **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most (80).
- **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most (51).
- **Item 7**: Agent 3 values it the most (83).
- **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it the most (79).

Based on this allocation, we can create the following assignments:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 6, 7],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents in a way that maximizes their individual valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.
