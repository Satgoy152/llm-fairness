Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  74  78   9  11  55  44  22  71
1   0  49   0  57  59  44  46   1  34
2  69  63  54  35  56  72   5  57  73
3  15  81  87  15  22  56  21  66  65
4  61  70  25  50  52  83  90   2  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from the items they are allocated, while ensuring every item is allocated to exactly one agent. We can achieve this by considering each agent's preferences for each item and ensuring that the distribution is as fair as possible. Here's a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 1, 2, and 8.
2. Agent 1 has high values for items 3 and 4.
3. Agent 2 has high values for items 5 and 8.
4. Agent 3 has high values for items 1, 2, 7, and 8.
5. Agent 4 has high values for items 5 and 6.

Let's allocate items to maximize the total value:

- Assign item 2 to agent 3 (highest value of 87).
- Assign item 0 to agent 0 (highest value of 57).
- Assign item 1 to agent 3 (highest value of 81).
- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (highest value of 57).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (highest value of 59).
- Assign item 5 to agent 4 (highest value of 83).
- Assign item 6 to agent 4 (highest value of 90).
- Assign item 7 to agent 3 (highest value of 66).
- Assign item 8 to agent 2 (highest value of 73).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent and attempts to maximize the individual agents' valuations.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2, 1, 7],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```
