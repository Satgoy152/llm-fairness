Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  26  12  40  36   1  97  56  55
1  25  32  37  71  89  26  76  27  78
2  31  57  95  35   4  69  25  10  96
3  92  27  62  28  50  79   6  81  56
4  55  67  27  25  44  71  47  73  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's consider maximizing each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations. We need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share, considering the total number of items is 9. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 6 (value 97).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 4 (value 89).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 2 (value 95).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 0 (value 92).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 8 (value 82).

Next, assign the remaining items based on the highest remaining valuations:

6. **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (value 71).
7. **Agent 4**: Assign item 5 (value 71).
8. **Agent 3**: Assign item 7 (value 81).
9. **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (value 26).

This way, each agent receives at least one item. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [8, 5]
}
```
