Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  98  95  95  66  10  36  82   6
1   7  53  52  59  65  79  30  35  74
2   0  89  76  11   5  31  17  62   4
3   3  74  19   3  78  96  65  35   1
4  48  68  69  94  18  40  65  49  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 7 53 52 59 65 79 30 35 74]
 [ 0 89 76 11  5 31 17 62  4]

 [48 68 69 94 18 40 65 49 11]]
Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of items among the agents, we will try to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We must also ensure that exactly 9 items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table and try to distribute the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Values items 0, 1, 2, and 3 highly.
2. **Agent 1**: Values items 5, 8 highly.
3. **Agent 2**: Values items 1, 2, and 7 highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Values items 4, 5, and 6 highly.
5. **Agent 4**: Values items 3, 4, and 6 highly.

Now, let's assign items:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (value 61) and item 1 (value 98).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 8 (value 74).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (value 76).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 5 (value 96).
- **Agent 4**: Assign items 3 (value 94) and 4 (value 18).

This allocation leaves items 6 and 7 unallocated. For balance, let's assign:

- **Agent 1**: Also receives item 7 (value 35).
- **Agent 3**: Also receives item 6 (value 65).

This way, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [8, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
