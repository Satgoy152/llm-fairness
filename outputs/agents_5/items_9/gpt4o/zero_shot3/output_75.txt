Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  90  47  91  84   4  96  61  54
1   1  45  33   8  84  81  51  58  81
2  81  25  66  66  68  46  90  26  86
3  28  15  62  11  53  31  33  67  19
4  97  19  17  37  91  60  57  15  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items such that all items are allocated. Here is one approach to achieve this:

1. Identify which items are most valued by each agent.
2. Try to distribute the items so that each agent receives a similar total value from their allocated items.

Using this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3] with values 87 and 91, respectively.
- Agent 1: Items [4, 8] with values 84 and 81, respectively.
- Agent 2: Items [2, 6] with values 66 and 90, respectively.
- Agent 3: Items [5] with value 31.
- Agent 4: Items [1, 7] with values 19 and 15, respectively.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```
