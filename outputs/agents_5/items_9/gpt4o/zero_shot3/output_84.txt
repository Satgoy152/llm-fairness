Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  67  45   1  86  15  38  24  83
1  38   0  10  76  58  38  29  85   7
2  29  74  65  30  64  85  50  25  77
3  39  31  37  10  87  60  37  51   7
4  40  14  83  18  30  47  78  27  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them so that each agent's share maximizes fairness, potentially based on their valuations. Given that the goal is to optimize perceived fairness, one approach is to allocate items in a way that tries to balance the total valuation each agent receives.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Find the Maximum Valuation for Each Item:** We allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, as this allocation would maximize individual satisfaction.

2. **Resolve Conflicts:** If an item has the same highest valuation by multiple agents, we need to consider the total value an agent has received so far and aim to balance it across agents.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:** If any items are left unallocated (due to tie breaking or other reasons), distribute them in a way that balances the total perceived value among agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (29).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (74).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (83).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (76).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (86).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (85).
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (78).
- **Item 7**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (85).
- **Item 8**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (83).

No conflicts arise from this allocation strategy, as each item is assigned to a unique agent. Let's ensure each agent has a fair distribution of items:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, 8
- Agent 1: Items 3, 7
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5
- Agent 3: No items with highest valuation
- Agent 4: Items 2, 6

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving the items they value most highly. Here's the final JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 8],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 6]
}
```
