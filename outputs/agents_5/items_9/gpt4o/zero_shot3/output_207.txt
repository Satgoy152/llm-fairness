Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  22   4  25   5  39  97  39  69
1  96  63  73  59   0  14  49  62  65
2  67  21  89  11  85  83  10  83  67
3  40  82  47   6  96  26  27   8  53
4  53  26  57  53  10   3  59  70  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [96 63 73 59  0 14 49 62 65]
 [67 21 89 11 85 83 10 83 67]

 [53 26 57 53 10  3 59 70 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This can be approached as an optimization or assignment problem. Let's consider a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 6 the highest, so we allocate item 6 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest, so we allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest, so we allocate item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest, so we allocate item 4 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 8 the highest, so we allocate item 8 to agent 4.
- Allocate the remaining items to balance valuations across agents, considering their next highest valuations.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 6, 5 (valuations of 97, 39)
- Agent 1: Items 0 (valuation of 96)
- Agent 2: Items 2 (valuation of 89)
- Agent 3: Items 4, 3 (valuations of 96, 6)
- Agent 4: Items 8, 7, 1 (valuations of 82, 70, 26)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [8, 7, 1]
}
```
