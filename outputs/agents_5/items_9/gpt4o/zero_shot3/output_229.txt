Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  60  99  89  75  21  24  26  95
1  99  65  33  11  30  24  80  34  89
2  13  32  92  86  39  21  37  32   1
3  22  57  19  52  64  85  30  81  80
4  82  78  42  30  17  21  15   3  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for each agent to receive items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed. We also aim to distribute the allocations as evenly as possible among the agents.

Let's follow a process to achieve this:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: Look for items that are highly valued by specific agents and consider prioritizing those allocations.
2. **Even Distribution**: Aim to distribute the items evenly across all agents.
3. **Maximize Total Valuation**: Allocate items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction (i.e., total valuation) of the agents.

Below is a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly, followed by item 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly and item 8 as well.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly, but since item 2 is already taken, the next best would be item 3.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly, followed by item 8, but since item 8 is taken, we allocate item 7.
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly, but since it's taken, we choose items 1 and 4.

Considering these observations, here is a proposed fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 4, 5, 6]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets the item they value the most.
- Agent 1 gets two of their highly valued items.
- Agent 2 gets one of their higher-valued items.
- Agent 3 gets one of their higher-valued items.
- Agent 4 receives four items, distributed among their moderately valued preferences to ensure all items are allocated.
