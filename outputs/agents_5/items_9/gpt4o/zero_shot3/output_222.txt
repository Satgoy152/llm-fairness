Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  64  63  10  40  84  91  11  96
1  81  97  88  63  96  14  87  50  92
2  68  52  28  83  99  28  89  92  53
3  27  99  54  16   7  72  90  97   4
4  33  26  84  54  85  57  73  34  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to ensure that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. We can use a simple approach to maximize the total valuation for each agent by assigning items with higher valuations first, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's follow these steps:

1. List each agent's top preferences for items based on their valuations.
2. Assign items in a way that each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation maximizes their total valuation.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [5, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [3, 7]
- Agent 3: Items [6]
- Agent 4: Items [0, 2]

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Now, let's present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
