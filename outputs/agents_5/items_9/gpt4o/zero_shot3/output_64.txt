Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  36  39  15  88  92  90  60  53
1  73  23  77  98  63  33   9  62  13
2   7  44  73  85  80  49  62  27  56
3  39   0  93  50  44  30  44  17   6
4  68  62  54  15  68  18  65  39   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We will try to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and the distribution is as equitable as possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest value for item 5 (92) and item 6 (90).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 3 (98).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 2 (73).
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 0 (39).
5. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 4 (68).

Now, allocate the remaining items to balance the distribution while maximizing the values:

- Agent 0: Already has items 5 and 6, add item 1 (36) which is one of the highest remaining values.
- Agent 1: Already has item 3, add item 7 (62) which is one of the highest remaining values.
- Agent 2: Already has item 2, add item 8 (56) which is one of the highest remaining values.
- Agent 3: Already has item 0, add item 3 (50) which balances the distribution.
- Agent 4: Already has item 4.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, while also attempting to maximize the total valuation for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6, 1],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
