Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  92  60   1  15  88  23   2  34
1  96  23  95  19  40  71  41  26  46
2  15  89  70  16  23  80  14  37  52
3  28  55  39  39  17  66   7  27  72
4   5  15  37  18  14  12  36  53  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's overall value for their assigned items while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign the highest valued items to agents who value them the most.
2. Continue allocating items to agents while considering both the value and ensuring each agent gets at least some items if possible.

Here is one possible allocation based on the given values:

- Agent 0: Assign items 0, 1
- Agent 1: Assign items 2, 5
- Agent 2: Assign items 6
- Agent 3: Assign items 8
- Agent 4: Assign items 3, 4, 7

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items. 

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3, 4, 7]
}
```
