Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  47   7  84  38  64  24  64  71
1  34  90  23  19  45  88  44  23  55
2  98  51  41  97   9  30  29  68   3
3  68   1  11   9  38  95  35  13  50
4  69   5  93  58  76  51  24  18  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total valuation and ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a simple heuristic approach. We will try to allocate items to the agent who values them the most. Let's proceed with this strategy:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item and allocate it to the corresponding agent.**
2. **Ensure each agent has an integer number of items.**

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 2 values it the most (98).
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the most (90).
3. **Item 2:** Agent 4 values it the most (93).
4. **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it the most (97).
5. **Item 4:** Agent 4 values it the most (76).
6. **Item 5:** Agent 3 values it the most (95).
7. **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it the most (44).
8. **Item 7:** Agent 2 values it the most (68).
9. **Item 8:** Agent 0 values it the most (71).

After allocating based on the highest values, we ensure each agent has an integer number of items. Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets Item 8.
- Agent 1 gets Items 1 and 6.
- Agent 2 gets Items 0, 3, and 7.
- Agent 3 gets Item 5.
- Agent 4 gets Items 2 and 4.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [0, 3, 7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.
