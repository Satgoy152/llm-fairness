Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  54  79  58  18  90  28  11  89
1  84  93   4   9  59  51  57  60  36
2  67  67  78  79  35  15  70  70  32
3  15  10  50  46  55   7  38  34  49
4  85  17  26  41  43  96   5  78  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. This can be done by ensuring that each agent receives items that they value highly, while also ensuring that all items are distributed.

Given the valuation matrix, we can use a greedy approach to allocate items to agents. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as they value it the most (99).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1, as they value it the most (93).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as they value it the most (79).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as they value it the most (79).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as it's their highest remaining valued item (59).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 4, as they value it the most (96).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 2, as they value it the most (70).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 4, as they value it the most (78).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 4, as they value it the most (82).

In this allocation, we ensure that each item is assigned to an agent who values it highly, while also making sure all items are distributed.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5, 7, 8]
}
```
