Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  40  94  10  36   1  10  56  52
1  56  55  98  56  29  82  17   5  21
2   6  84  86  49  77  38  75  91  48
3  17  85  65  24  58  87  96  63  22
4  93   3  42  50  39  30  61  63  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's consider the following approach:

1. **Identify Preferences:** Review the valuations to see which items are highly valued by each agent.
2. **Allocate High-Valued Items:** Begin by allocating the highest valued items to the agents that value them the most.
3. **Distribute Remaining Items:** Allocate the remaining items in such a way that tries to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's go through the process:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 2 at 94, which is the highest value among all agents for item 2.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 2 at 98, but since it's already allocated, let's look at the next highest, which is item 5 valued at 82.
- **Agent 2:** Highly values item 7 at 91.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 6 at 96, which is the highest value among all agents for item 6.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 0 at 93, which is the highest value among all agents for item 0.

After allocating these high-value items, we have the following allocations:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [7]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [0]

Now, distribute the remaining items (1, 3, 4, and 8) considering the next highest preferences and balancing:

- **Item 1:** Agent 3 values it at 85, the highest.
- **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it at 49, the highest remaining.
- **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it at 77, the highest.
- **Item 8:** Agent 0 values it at 52, which is the highest remaining.

This results in the following allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 8]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [7, 3, 4]
- Agent 3: [6, 1]
- Agent 4: [0]

Making sure all items are allocated, here's the final JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7, 3, 4],
    "3": [6, 1],
    "4": [0]
}
```
