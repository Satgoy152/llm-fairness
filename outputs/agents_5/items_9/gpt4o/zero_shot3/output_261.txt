Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  37  53  35  24  35  90  91   8   6
1  61  91  35  64  92  87   7  98  84
2  59   9  84  50  10  72  43  47  22
3  47  68  25  88   9  82  67  49  12
4   7   1  18  29  28  47  68  55  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share according to their valuation. Given the constraint that each agent should receive an integer number of items and that all 9 items must be allocated, we can proceed as follows:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 5 and 6.
   - Agent 1 values items 1, 4, and 7 highly.
   - Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2.
   - Agent 3 values item 3 highly.
   - Agent 4 values item 8 highly.

2. **Allocation Strategy**:
   - Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item where possible.
   - Distribute remaining items to maintain fairness.

3. **Allocation Plan**:
   - Agent 0: Items 5 and 6 (high valuations)
   - Agent 1: Items 1 and 4 (high valuations)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (high valuation)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 (high valuation)
   - Agent 4: Item 8 (high valuation)

4. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Items 0 and 7 remain. 
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 1 to balance allocations because Agent 1 has a high valuation for multiple items.
   - Assign Item 7 to Agent 4 to ensure they receive more than one item.

5. **Final Allocation**:
   - Agent 0: [5, 6]
   - Agent 1: [1, 4, 0]
   - Agent 2: [2]
   - Agent 3: [3]
   - Agent 4: [8, 7]

The allocation ensures that all items are distributed while considering the agents' valuations. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 4, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [8, 7]
}
```
