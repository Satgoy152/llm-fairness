Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  47  62  72  71  60  18  84  39
1  26  16  13  82  47  81  90  26  73
2  58  88  40  39  66  39  11  95  42
3  34   4  70  76   9  46  58  29  86
4  27  54  72  98  41   9  88  17  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We will ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. 

Here's a possible allocation based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while distributing the items fairly:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 72.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the highest at 90.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 88.
- Agent 3 values item 8 the highest at 86.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the highest at 98, but item 3 is already taken by Agent 0, so we will consider the next highest available item, which is item 2 at 72.

Let's proceed with this allocation and ensure all items are distributed:

1. **Agent 0**: [3]
2. **Agent 1**: [6]
3. **Agent 2**: [1]
4. **Agent 3**: [8]
5. **Agent 4**: [2]

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can take item 0 (valued at 45).
- Agent 1 can take item 5 (valued at 81).
- Agent 2 can take item 7 (valued at 95).
- Agent 3 can take item 4 (valued at 9).

Now let's check if all items are allocated:

- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 (all 9 items).

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [8, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and considers the valuations of each agent to maximize overall satisfaction.
