Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12   0  58  70  99  90  61  70  46
1   6  26  78  30  11  24  44  53  55
2  21  21  47  94  54  70  84  61  99
3  96  53  65  58  98  81  17   0  62
4  70  29  98  28  32  55  31  92  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. The goal is to distribute the items as evenly as possible while considering each agent's valuations to ensure a fair distribution. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 4 (99) and item 3 (70). Assign items 4 and 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 2 (78). Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 8 (99) and item 6 (84). Assign items 8 and 6 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 0 (96) and item 4 (98). Since item 4 is already taken, assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent has a high value for item 2 (98), but it's taken. Assign item 7 (92) to Agent 4.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Items [8, 6]
- Agent 3: Item [0]
- Agent 4: Item [7]

Total items allocated: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7

We still need to assign 2 more items. Re-evaluate to balance the distribution:

- Reassign item 1 to Agent 1, who values it at 26.
- Reassign item 5 to Agent 3, who values it at 81.

This results in:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [8, 6]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 4: Item [7]

Now, let's output the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [8, 6],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [7]
}
```
