Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  20  90  45  58  31  84  58  73
1   9  53  67  87  57  46  89  85  86
2  36  18  55  35  13  21  36  29  50
3  43  59  67   7  73  79   3  48  75
4  41  41   3  88   8  14  88  37  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we can use a simple method that involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. We'll ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and we'll also ensure that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's go through each item and assign it to the agent with the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 36, Agent 1 at 9, Agent 2 at 36, Agent 3 at 43, Agent 4 at 41. Assign to Agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it at 20, Agent 1 at 53, Agent 2 at 18, Agent 3 at 59, Agent 4 at 41. Assign to Agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 90, Agent 1 at 67, Agent 2 at 55, Agent 3 at 67, Agent 4 at 3. Assign to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 45, Agent 1 at 87, Agent 2 at 35, Agent 3 at 7, Agent 4 at 88. Assign to Agent 4.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 at 57, Agent 2 at 13, Agent 3 at 73, Agent 4 at 8. Assign to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 31, Agent 1 at 46, Agent 2 at 21, Agent 3 at 79, Agent 4 at 14. Assign to Agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 0 values it at 84, Agent 1 at 89, Agent 2 at 36, Agent 3 at 3, Agent 4 at 88. Assign to Agent 1.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it at 58, Agent 1 at 85, Agent 2 at 29, Agent 3 at 48, Agent 4 at 37. Assign to Agent 1.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it at 73, Agent 1 at 86, Agent 2 at 50, Agent 3 at 75, Agent 4 at 93. Assign to Agent 4.

Let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Items 6, 7
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1, 4, 5
- Agent 4: Items 3, 8

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1, 4, 5],
    "4": [3, 8]
}
```
