Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  88  90  82  25  14  62  39   8
1  77  45  70   3  98  44  98  31  78
2  14  57  59  72  50  57  29  73  51
3  30  33  88  80  23   8  34  73  38
4  72  82  33  92   3  30  65  17  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Select the items with the highest values for agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Select the items with the highest values for agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Select the items with the highest values for agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Select the items with the highest values for agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Select the items with the highest values for agent 4.

First, assign the highest value items to each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Item 2 (Value 90), Item 1 (Value 88)
- **Agent 1:** Item 4 (Value 98), Item 6 (Value 98)
- **Agent 2:** Item 3 (Value 72), Item 7 (Value 73)
- **Agent 3:** Item 8 (Value 38)
- **Agent 4:** Item 0 (Value 72)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share and maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [0]
}
```
