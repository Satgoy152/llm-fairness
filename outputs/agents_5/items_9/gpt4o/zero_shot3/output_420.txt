Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85   8  18  45  90  34  70  89  34
1  54  18  25  31  97  43  71  90  63
2   1  43  29  69   4  20  51  10   9
3  47  72  58   7  34  41  90  65  81
4  16  13  85   9  74  45  48  60  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [16 13 85  9 74 45 48 60 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider the preferences of each agent for the items. A straightforward approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation each agent has for an item that hasn't been allocated yet. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 4 (Value: 90)
   - Item 7 (Value: 89)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Item 5 (Value: 43)
   - Item 8 (Value: 63)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Item 3 (Value: 69)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Item 6 (Value: 90)
   - Item 1 (Value: 72)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Item 2 (Value: 85)
   - Item 0 (Value: 16)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated based on high valuations by the agents. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 1],
    "4": [2, 0]
}
```
