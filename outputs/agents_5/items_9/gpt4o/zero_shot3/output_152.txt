Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  84  98  34  31  81  70  73  50
1  44   6  13  55  20  87  91   6  82
2  76  26  80  97  85   6  64  80  19
3  77   5   5  43  69  95  90  39  22
4  71  86  69   8   8  67   8  73  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that every agent is considered, and all items are distributed.

First, let's go through the valuation table again and allocate the items:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  84  98  34  31  81  70  73  50
1  44   6  13  55  20  87  91   6  82
2  76  26  80  97  85   6  64  80  19
3  77   5   5  43  69  95  90  39  22
4  71  86  69   8   8  67   8  73  22
```

Next, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 2, 1, and 5. Allocate items 2 and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations for items 6, 5, and 8. Allocate items 6 and 8.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations for items 3 and 4. Allocate items 3 and 4.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 5, but it's already taken by agent 0. Allocate item 0.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuations for items 1, 0, and 7. Allocate items 1 and 7.

Now, let's ensure every item is allocated and each agent is considered:

- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- Agents have been allocated items according to their highest valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the agents' valuations, while each agent receives at least one item.
