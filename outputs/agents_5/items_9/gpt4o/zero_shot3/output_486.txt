Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  86  18  53  67  96  25  75  43
1  47  12  56  11  77  67   5  15  69
2  28  68  62  78  60   9  72  97  11
3  82  80  71   6  76   5  17  48  78
4  50  80  56  58  53  15   8  41  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives at least one item while maximizing their satisfaction based on their valuations. This can be a complex problem, but a straightforward heuristic is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Item 0:** The highest value is 82 (Agent 3).
2. **Item 1:** The highest value is 86 (Agent 0).
3. **Item 2:** The highest value is 71 (Agent 3).
4. **Item 3:** The highest value is 78 (Agent 2).
5. **Item 4:** The highest value is 77 (Agent 1).
6. **Item 5:** The highest value is 96 (Agent 0).
7. **Item 6:** The highest value is 72 (Agent 2).
8. **Item 7:** The highest value is 97 (Agent 2).
9. **Item 8:** The highest value is 78 (Agent 3).

Now, we need to ensure each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. From the above allocation, Agent 4 has not received any items, so we must reallocate to ensure fairness.

Let's adjust the allocation:

- Reassign Item 4 (Agent 1's highest value) to Agent 4, who values it 53, ensuring Agent 4 receives at least one item.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [1, 5]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [3, 6, 7]
- Agent 3: [0, 2, 8]
- Agent 4: [4]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3, 6, 7],
    "3": [0, 2, 8],
    "4": [4]
}
```
