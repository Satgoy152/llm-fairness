Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  58  50  19  55   8  61  49  27
1  15  40  96  63  29  69  79  54  57
2  42   1  47  48   3  39   2  99   5
3  90  27  65  66  43  89  71  22  14
4  67  84  57  55  68  85  64  15  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value perceived by each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and each item is assigned to one agent. Here's one approach:

1. Identify the highest value an agent places on any item and allocate that item to that agent.
2. Remove the allocated item from further consideration and repeat the process for remaining items and agents.
3. Ensure each agent gets at least one item, even if it means allocating a less valued item.

Let's go through the process step-by-step for this specific case:

1. Each agent's highest valuations:
   - Agent 0: Item 0 (86)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (96)
   - Agent 2: Item 7 (99)
   - Agent 3: Item 5 (89)
   - Agent 4: Item 5 (85)

2. From the highest valuations, we allocate:
   - Item 0 to Agent 0
   - Item 2 to Agent 1
   - Item 7 to Agent 2
   - Item 5 to Agent 3 (higher value than Agent 4's choice)

3. Allocate remaining items for fairness:
   - Items left: 1, 3, 4, 6, 8
   - Allocate based on remaining high values while ensuring every agent gets at least one item.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2, 1]
- Agent 2: [7, 3]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [4, 6, 8]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures fairness by considering each agent's highest valuation and ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Additionally, the allocation is adjusted to ensure all items are distributed.
