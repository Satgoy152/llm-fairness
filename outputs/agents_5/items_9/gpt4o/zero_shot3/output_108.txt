Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  24  84  13  80  67  17  91  77
1  69  70  88  37  96  47   5  48  87
2  31  57  35  47  77  26   1  43  22
3  76  94   5  18  54  94  19  19   9
4  38  18  55  43  60  34  62  70  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One common approach is to allocate the item that each agent values the most, then distribute the remaining items to balance the total number of items each agent receives. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by examining which item each agent values the most.
2. Allocate that item to the respective agent.
3. Distribute remaining items to ensure each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Agent 0 values item 7 the most (with a value of 91).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (with a value of 96).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the most (with a value of 77), but since item 4 is already assigned to Agent 1, consider the next highest value, which is item 1 (value 57).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (with a value of 94), but since item 1 is already assigned to Agent 2, consider the next highest value, which is item 5 (value 94).
- Agent 4 values item 8 the most (with a value of 88).

Now, distribute the remaining items fairly:

- Remaining items: 0, 2, 3, 6
- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (next highest value 65).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (next highest value 84).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest value 37).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (next highest value 62).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 0, 2],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [8, 6]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed.
