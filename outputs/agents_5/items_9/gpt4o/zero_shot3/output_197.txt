Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  17  76  13  51  62  45  65  35
1  43  65  76  37  25  55  33  43  33
2  90  48   6  92  32  66  36  59  15
3  10  94  97  94  24  55  93  66  63
4  91  34  59  98  53  97  20  44  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize each agent's total valuation for the items they receive, while ensuring that every item is allocated to one agent.

Let's proceed by examining the valuations and making allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
    - Highest valuation: Item 2 (76)
    - Other valuations above 60: Item 0 (63), Item 5 (62), Item 7 (65)
    - Allocate Item 2 and Item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
    - Highest valuation: Item 2 (76) - already taken
    - Other high valuations: Item 1 (65), Item 5 (55)
    - Allocate Item 1 and Item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
    - Highest valuation: Item 3 (92)
    - Other valuations above 60: Item 0 (90) - already taken, Item 5 (66)
    - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
    - Highest valuation: Item 2 (97) - already taken
    - Other high valuations: Item 1 (94) - already taken, Item 3 (94) - already taken, Item 6 (93)
    - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
    - Highest valuation: Item 3 (98) - already taken
    - Other high valuations: Item 5 (97) - already taken, Item 0 (91) - already taken
    - Allocate remaining items to Agent 4.

Finally, the allocation can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [4, 7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents.
