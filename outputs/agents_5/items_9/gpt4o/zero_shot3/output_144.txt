Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  92  90  94  76  29  48  67   2
1  46  62  31  69  57   4  72  21   1
2   3   0  73  54  72  78  95  10  82
3  76  61  15  83  74  86   3   4  35
4  10   1   1  60  94  68  64  56  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This can be approached using a variation of the maximum weight matching or a greedy algorithm to approximate the optimal solution. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest value each agent has for any item**: 
   - Agent 0: Items 3 (value 94), 1 (value 92), 2 (value 90)
   - Agent 1: Items 5 (value 72), 3 (value 69)
   - Agent 2: Items 6 (value 95), 8 (value 82)
   - Agent 3: Items 5 (value 86), 3 (value 83)
   - Agent 4: Items 4 (value 94), 3 (value 60)
   
2. **Allocate items to maximize value**:
   - Start by allocating the highest value items to each agent.
   - Ensure no item is allocated more than once.

3. **Adjust to ensure all items are allocated**:
   - Check remaining unallocated items and assign them to agents who value them relatively high.

Based on this method, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 2
- Agent 1 gets item 3
- Agent 2 gets items 6 and 8
- Agent 3 gets items 5 and 7
- Agent 4 gets items 0 and 4

The JSON format for this allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly among the agents, each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 9.
