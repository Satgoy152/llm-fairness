Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  66  22  16  16  59  57   9  78
1  63  21  56  60  35  44  36  97   6
2  81  67  46  39  82  42  82  34  36
3  26  34  38  17  74  80  37  83  65
4  56  61  19  82  41  40  13  98  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given that we have 5 agents and 9 items, some agents will necessarily receive more items than others. We'll attempt to distribute the items such that the most valued items for each agent are prioritized in their allocation.

Here's a step-by-step process for a possible allocation:

1. **Identify Preferences**: Look at the table to identify which items each agent values most.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Try to give each agent their highest valued item.
3. **Distribute Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items by considering the next highest valued items for each agent.

Let's allocate:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 0 the most (91). We'll start by allocating item 0 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Values item 7 the most (97). Allocate item 7 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Values items 4 and 6 equally the most (82). Allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the most (80). Allocate item 5 to agent 3.
- **Agent 4**: Values item 7 the most (98), but it's already taken, so allocate the next highest, which is item 3 (82).

Now, we have allocated 5 items. Let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Remaining Items**: 1, 2, 6, 8
- **Agent 0** gets the next highest value item, item 8 (78).
- **Agent 1** gets item 6 as its next highest value after item 7 (36).
- **Agent 2** gets item 1 (67).
- **Agent 3** gets item 2 (38).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and prioritizes higher valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [7, 6],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [5, 2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
