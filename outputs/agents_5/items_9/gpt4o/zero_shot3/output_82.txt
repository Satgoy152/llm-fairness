Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  58  48  81  30  62  66  62  16
1  82  64  65  80  26  28  72  18  58
2  94  26  33  86  29  10  57  69  30
3  25  72  45  85  72  32  96  50  12
4  73  48   8  93  96  40  18  99  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that respects their valuations, ensuring that each agent gets some value from the items they receive. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value item is 81 (Item 3).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value item is 82 (Item 0).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value item is 94 (Item 0), but since Item 0 is taken, next highest is 86 (Item 3), but since Item 3 is taken, next is 69 (Item 7).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value item is 96 (Item 6).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value item is 99 (Item 7), but since Item 7 is taken, next is 96 (Item 4).

Continuing this process while ensuring each item is only allocated once:

- Agent 0 receives Items 1 and 5 (total value = 58 + 62 = 120).
- Agent 1 receives Item 0 (total value = 82).
- Agent 2 receives Item 7 (total value = 69).
- Agent 3 receives Items 2, 6, and 8 (total value = 45 + 96 + 12 = 153).
- Agent 4 receives Items 3 and 4 (total value = 93 + 96 = 189).

This allocation ensures all 9 items are distributed. Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [2, 6, 8],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
