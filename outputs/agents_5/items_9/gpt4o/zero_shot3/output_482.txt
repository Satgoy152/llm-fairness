Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  73  54  16  78  20   0  30  13
1  58  48  89   6  71  66  41  71  43
2   7  49  27  74  47   3  43  40  93
3  99  68  90  70  22  94  10  45  73
4  93  19  79  88  22  40  80  70  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives approximately equal value based on their preferences, while also ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

One way to achieve this is by iteratively assigning each item to the agent who values it the most and then adjusting to balance the distribution. Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most relative to others, so we assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 the most, so we assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 8 the most, so we assign item 8 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the most, so we assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the most, so we assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (1, 5, 6, 7) to balance the distribution:

6. Agent 1 also values item 1 relatively high, so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
7. Agent 3 values item 5 relatively high, so we assign item 5 to Agent 3.
8. Agent 4 values item 7 relatively high, so we assign item 7 to Agent 4.
9. Agent 0 values item 6 relatively high, so we assign item 6 to Agent 0.

This allocation distributes the items while considering each agent's preferences.

Final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
