Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  96  67  96  22  98  41  71  22  77
1   8  14  65  11  76  46  48  23  33
2  94   8  95  50   2  10  96   4  14
3  91   7  60  64  33  59  11  93  25
4  78  91  21  39  24  19  24  44  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents, we can follow a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 0, 2, and 4. We'll allocate items 0 and 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 2 the most. We'll allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 6 the most. We'll allocate item 6 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 the most. We'll allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 1 the most. We'll allocate item 1 to agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 5, 7, and 8:

6. **Agent 0**: Since agent 0 already has two high-value items, we can skip adding more to maintain fairness.
7. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 8 to agent 1, as it adds more value to their allocation.
8. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 5 to agent 2, as it is still available.
9. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 7 to agent 3, as it is still available.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [6, 5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the 5 agents with each agent receiving at least one item.
