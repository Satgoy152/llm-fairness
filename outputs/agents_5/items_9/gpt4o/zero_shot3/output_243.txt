Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  88  70  94  64  43  12  29  79  62
1   4  44  38  35  95  85   9  67  45
2  40  21  57  77  72  98  18  26  51
3   3  72  21  47  85  94  32  87  88
4  85  35  28   5  33  71  18  71  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent**: Check which items each agent values the most.

2. **Prioritize allocation based on valuation**: Allocate items by prioritizing the agent who values a particular item the most, ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Every item should be assigned to an agent.

4. **Maintain fairness in allocation**: Try to distribute items such that each agent gets approximately the same number of items, adjusting as necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Here's how the allocation can be done:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (value of 94).
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly (value of 95).
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly (value of 98).
- Agent 3 values item 7 highly (value of 87).
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly (value of 85).

After allocating these high-value items, we move to the remaining items:

- Agent 0 can also get item 3 (value of 64).
- Agent 1 can get item 8 (value of 45).
- Agent 2 can get item 6 (value of 18).
- Agent 3 can get item 1 (value of 72).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [7, 1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the value for each agent based on their preferences and ensures all items are distributed among the agents.
