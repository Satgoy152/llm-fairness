Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  20  75  63  11   7  87  74  78  96
1  57  89  80  76  48  54  67  71  48
2  49  74  34  53  33  99  81  95  75
3  26  24  93  89  55  77  20  37  21
4  82  10  36  17  51  94  17  74  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all 9 items being allocated, and try to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: We can allocate items that are highly valued by the agent.
2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, allocate items based on high valuations.
3. **Agent 2**: Consider items that this agent values highly.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items based on this agent's preferences.
5. **Agent 4**: Allocate remaining items to this agent based on preference.

Given these considerations, here is a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 8
- **Agent 1**: Items 1 and 4
- **Agent 2**: Items 5 and 7
- **Agent 3**: Item 2
- **Agent 4**: Items 3 and 6

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```
