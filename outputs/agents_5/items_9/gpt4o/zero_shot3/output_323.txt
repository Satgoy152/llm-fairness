Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17  87  31  58  77  35  33   2  44
1  75   4   4  60  35  26  31  32  40
2  68  24  34  13  91  34  39  54  51
3  59  68  10  61  66  86  36  96  20
4  92  39   9  26  59  24  88  25  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate the items in a way that each agent gets items with the highest values possible according to their own preferences, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Picks item 1 (87), item 4 (77), and item 3 (58).
2. **Agent 1**: Picks item 0 (75) and item 8 (40).
3. **Agent 2**: Picks item 6 (39).
4. **Agent 3**: Picks item 7 (96).
5. **Agent 4**: Picks item 5 (24) and item 2 (9).

This ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets items based on their highest valuations where possible.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 3],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```
