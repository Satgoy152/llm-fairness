Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  17  50  15  20  33  87  59  19
1  98  66   7  68  74  30  46   3  54
2  96  46  20  89  40  56  20  60   7
3  32  27  57   1   1   0  11  27  85
4  50  34  59  23  75  48  16  61   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Key items that Agent 0 values highly are item 6 (value 87) and item 2 (value 50).
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 0 the most (value 98).
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 3 the most (value 89).
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 8 the most (value 85).
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 4 the most (value 75).

Given the above preferences, we can attempt the following allocation:

- Assign item 6 and item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items. Consider the next highest valued items for each agent that haven't been allocated:

- Agent 0: Consider item 5 (value 33).
- Agent 1: Consider item 1 (value 66).
- Agent 2: Consider item 7 (value 60).
- Agent 3: Consider item 7 (value 27) but it is already given to Agent 2, so consider item 1 (value 27).
- Agent 4: Consider item 5 (value 48), but it is already given to Agent 0, so consider item 7 (value 61).

Let's finalize the allocation:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2.

This allocation uses all the items and each agent is assigned an integer number of items. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 2, 5],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4]
}
```
