Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   3   6  39  19  85  80  95  17  64
1   1  49  89  40  99  52  82  87  78
2   0  61  35  70  50  52  68  54  43
3  84  83  38  53  31  68  43  39  40
4  73  80  23  48  23  75   3  76  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to distribute items such that the distribution is balanced and fair. One common approach is to give each agent items they value highly while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's go through the items and allocate them to the agents:

1. Start by finding the highest valuation for each item.
2. Allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation, if possible.
3. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [7, 8]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 6, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 2, which they value very highly.
- Agent 2 receives items 1 and 3, which have relatively high values for them.
- Agent 3 receives item 0, which has a high value for them compared to other agents.
- Agent 4 receives items 7 and 8, balancing the distribution.

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences, while all 9 items are allocated.
