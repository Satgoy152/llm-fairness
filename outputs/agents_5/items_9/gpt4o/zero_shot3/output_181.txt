Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  36  85  63  67  97  79  53  78
1  41  34  80  15  56  95  11  29  40
2  12  69  33  29  83  74  12  36  99
3  29  77  14  89  26  10  45  50  44
4  11  28  21  26  52  23  98  32  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. Given there are 9 items and 5 agents, each agent should ideally get around 1 or 2 items. We'll strive to allocate the items to maximize the total valuation across all agents.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest values: Item 5 (97), Item 2 (85)
   - Allocate Item 5 and Item 2 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest values after Agent 0: Item 5 (already allocated), Item 2 (already allocated), Item 0 (41), Item 4 (56)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest values after previous allocations: Item 8 (99), Item 4 (83)
   - Allocate Item 8 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest values after previous allocations: Item 3 (89), Item 1 (77)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Highest values after previous allocations: Item 6 (98), Item 7 (32)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 4

6. **Remaining Items:** 
   - Items left to allocate: Item 0, Item 1, Item 7
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 3 (highest remaining value for Agent 3)
   - Allocate Item 7 to Agent 1 (highest remaining value for Agent 1)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 4 (highest remaining value for Agent 4)

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of the items based on their valuations.
