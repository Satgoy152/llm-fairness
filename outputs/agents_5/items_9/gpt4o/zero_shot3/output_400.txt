Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  55  40  93  14  53  67  43  69
1  23  83  27  88  11   4  44  80  26
2  27  69   4  11  29  59  30  15  74
3  20  48   7  77  54  14  82  30  13
4  68  99   7  36  15  78  72  99  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a greedy algorithm. This approach involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are distributed among the agents. Here's how the allocation would look:

1. Item 0: Agent 4 values it highest at 68.
2. Item 1: Agent 4 values it highest at 99.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it highest at 40.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it highest at 93.
5. Item 4: Agent 3 values it highest at 54.
6. Item 5: Agent 4 values it highest at 78.
7. Item 6: Agent 3 values it highest at 82.
8. Item 7: Agent 4 values it highest at 99.
9. Item 8: Agent 2 values it highest at 74.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [4, 6],
    "4": [0, 1, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all 9 items are allocated.
