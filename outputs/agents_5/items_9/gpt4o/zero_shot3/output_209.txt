Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  13  93  11  35  76  45  68  85   1
1  32  41   2  32  23  41  61  53  24
2  23  58  25  51  73  17   6  93  84
3  26  81  42  94  96  85  63  89  42
4   5  98  23  90  48  95  97  93  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets a reasonable share of their valued items, while also considering that each agent should get an integer number of items and all 9 items in total must be allocated.

Let's examine the value each agent places on each item and distribute the items based on maximizing individual agents' valuations while ensuring a fair distribution.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 1 and 7.
- Agent 1 values item 6 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for items 4 and 5.
- Agent 4 values items 2 and 8 the most.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items they value highly, while all 9 items are distributed.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [2, 8, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and it distributes all 9 items among the 5 agents.
