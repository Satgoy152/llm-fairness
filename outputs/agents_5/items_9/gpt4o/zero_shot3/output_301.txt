Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  72  47   9  39  84  63  87  73
1  99   7  65  94  56  12  95  70  87
2  67  25  77   4  83  82  33  99  51
3   1   2   8  55  21  15  34  43  58
4   6  61  97  16   8  30  45  23   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item and try to maximize the total value for each agent. However, fairness could also mean ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value or items. Given that we have 5 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others, but we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives.

One possible approach is to allocate items to the agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for item 7 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for item 0 and 6.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for item 3 and 8.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for item 4.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for item 2.

Following this strategy, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets items [7, 5]
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 6]
- Agent 2 gets items [3, 8]
- Agent 3 gets item [4]
- Agent 4 gets item [2]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 5],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
