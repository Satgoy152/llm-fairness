Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   6  90  85  73  88  25  73  10  12
1  92  12  25  84  38  53  81  32  97
2  39  53  55  46  13  80  46  92  15
3  39  95  64  74  64  28  29   2  99
4  54  90  55   4  38   9  38  82   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One common approach is to use the "maximum sum allocation" method, which aims to maximize the overall value distribution while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the "value density" for each agent-item pair, which is the value of the item for the agent divided by the total value of items for that agent. This helps to prioritize items that are relatively more valuable to each agent.

2. Allocate items to agents such that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

3. Adjust the allocations if necessary to ensure fairness and that each agent has at least one item.

Following this strategy, we can derive the allocations as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 8 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 7 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most.

Now, allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: [1, 0]
- Agent 1: [8]
- Agent 2: [7, 5]
- Agent 3: [3, 2]
- Agent 4: [4, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all 9 items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [7, 5],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
