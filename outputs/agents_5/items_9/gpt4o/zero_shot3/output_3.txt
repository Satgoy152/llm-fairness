Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  75  74  33  64  83  49  14  35
1  86  55  90  40  22  57  23  46  20
2  54  90  89  75  78  57   6  76  42
3  51  71  22  46  98  41  48  93  10
4  68   5   0  35  28  24  25   4  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 9 items allocated. A common approach is to use a method that maximizes fairness, such as the max-min fairness or envy-free allocation, but given the constraints, a simpler approach like maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent can also be used.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives as close an equal number of items as possible.
2. Break ties by assigning the item to the agent with fewer items at that point in the allocation process.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the valuations:

- Item 0: Valued highest by agent 1 with value 86.
- Item 1: Valued highest by agent 2 with value 90.
- Item 2: Valued highest by agent 1 with value 90.
- Item 3: Valued highest by agent 2 with value 75.
- Item 4: Valued highest by agent 3 with value 98.
- Item 5: Valued highest by agent 0 with value 83.
- Item 6: Valued highest by agent 0 with value 49.
- Item 7: Valued highest by agent 3 with value 93.
- Item 8: Valued highest by agent 4 with value 56.

Following these steps, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
