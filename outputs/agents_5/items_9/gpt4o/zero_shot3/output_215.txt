Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  40  45  72  61  41  52  49  17
1  38  97  94  63  87  97  87  81  79
2  52  43  64  49  80  17   0   5  97
3   8   2  14  61  47  76  72  95  66
4   5  70  69  23  70  50  76  28  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation across all agents while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and the total number of items is exactly 9, we will proceed as follows:

1. Assign each agent their most valued item first. 
2. Once each agent has at least one item, continue to allocate the remaining items by maximizing the total valuation.

Let's allocate the items based on the provided valuations:

1. **Initial Assignment:**
   - Agent 0 gets item 0 (value 98).
   - Agent 1 gets item 1 (value 97).
   - Agent 2 gets item 8 (value 97).
   - Agent 3 gets item 7 (value 95).
   - Agent 4 gets item 6 (value 76).

2. **Remaining Items:**
   - Items 2, 3, 4, 5 are unallocated.
   - Allocate remaining items by checking which agent values them the most among those still needing items.

3. **Allocate Remaining Items:**
   - Agent 1 gets item 5 (value 97).
   - Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 87).
   - Agent 3 gets item 3 (value 61).
   - Agent 0 gets item 2 (value 45).

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
