Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80  96  19  18  17  35  42  85  52
1   7  30  86  50  56  17  12  65  72
2  64   9  47   0  76  58  94  60  77
3  62  62  94  19  56  44  66  55  84
4  15  23  75  49  98  60  76  79  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value that each agent receives, ensuring that all 9 items are allocated. A simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Let's go through the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 80 by Agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 96 by Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 94 by Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 50 by Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 98 by Agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 60 by Agent 4.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 94 by Agent 2.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 85 by Agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 84 by Agent 3.

Now, let's check if each agent gets at least one item. If not, we will adjust the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Items [0, 1, 7]
- **Agent 1**: Item [3]
- **Agent 2**: Item [6]
- **Agent 3**: Items [2, 8]
- **Agent 4**: Items [4, 5]

Each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in the requested format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
