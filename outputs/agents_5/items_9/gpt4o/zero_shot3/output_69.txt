Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  97  52  34  85  94  34  88  78
1  24  71  48  48  31  84  70  28  38
2  81  68  30  20  80  62  64  92  75
3  60  87   0   3  92  41  27  85  28
4  12  71  75   7  82  57  76  95  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 5 agents, we should aim to maximize the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations. A common approach is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations**: Look for the highest valuations for each item across all agents.
2. **Allocate Items**: Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, if not yet assigned.
3. **Balance Allocation**: Ensure that each agent receives at least one item by reviewing any unallocated items and reallocating to underrepresented agents if necessary.

Following this process:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 1.
- **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 5.
- **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for items 0 and 7.
- **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 4.
- **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for items 2, 3, 6, and 8.

Reallocating to ensure all items are fairly distributed:

- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 4.
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 4.

Every agent should receive at least one item, and all items must be allocated. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3, 6, 8]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated while trying to maximize the agents' valuations.
