Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  90  39  50  23  51  14  39   9
1  89  38  61  92  66  70  11  31   4
2  67  40  15  47  32  79  88   6  41
3  79  28  79  76   9  15  35  69  67
4  27  57  30  15  62  64  37  45  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation. This approach attempts to distribute the items in a way that is relatively fair, based on each agent's preferences. Here's a step-by-step plan to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation:** Compute the total valuation each agent has for all items to understand their preferences.

2. **Assign Items:** Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation until all items are allocated. This can be done by iterating through each item and assigning it to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Ensure Fair Distribution:** Ensure that the distribution is as fair as possible, meaning no agent should feel significantly less satisfied compared to others.

4. **Adjust for Fairness:** If there are significant discrepancies in the total valuations after the initial allocation, adjust allocations to balance them out, keeping in mind each agentâ€™s preference.

Following this approach, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 7],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4]
}
```

Here's a brief explanation of the allocation:
- **Agent 0**: Allocated items 1, 2, and 7 as they have a high valuation for item 1 (90) and moderate valuations for items 2 and 7.
- **Agent 1**: Allocated items 3 and 0 because they have very high valuations for item 3 (92) and item 0 (89).
- **Agent 2**: Allocated items 5 and 6 as they have high valuations for these items (79 and 88, respectively).
- **Agent 3**: Allocated item 8 since they have the highest valuation for item 8 (67) compared to others.
- **Agent 4**: Allocated item 4 as they have a moderate valuation for it (62), and it helps in balancing the distribution.
