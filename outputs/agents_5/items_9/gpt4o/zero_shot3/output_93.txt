Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52   3  89  23   9  24  15  91  48
1  62  64  27  23  26  65  75  20  24
2  53  80  35  45  93  82  96  92  38
3  49  86  62   7  40  11   5  17  24
4   2  93   8  33  68   5  22  67  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations while making sure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 2 (89) and item 7 (91).
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values items 1 (64) and 5 (65).
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values items 4 (93) and 6 (96).
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 1 (86) and item 2 (62).
5. **Agent 4**: This agent highly values item 1 (93) and item 4 (68).

We should strive to allocate items such that each agent receives items they value relatively highly, and no agent is left without items unless unavoidable. Here's one way to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocate items [2, 7] as they have high valuations from agent 0.
- **Agent 1**: Allocate items [5] as it’s a high-valued choice for agent 1.
- **Agent 2**: Allocate items [4, 6] as they are valued highly by agent 2.
- **Agent 3**: Allocate items [3, 8] as they don’t have highly valued items left but can take these.
- **Agent 4**: Allocate items [1, 0] as they highly value item 1 and item 0 is the leftover.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value relatively highly while distributing all 9 items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [1, 0]
}
```
