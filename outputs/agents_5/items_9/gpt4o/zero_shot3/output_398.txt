Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  18  41  57  89  53  43  50  16
1  34  22  52  29  68  71  30  96  63
2  72  74  37  92  10  38  14  83  15
3  75  99  72  96  20  80  87  46  19
4   4  22  32  70  41  19   3  27  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. One common approach for this problem is the "maximum sum allocation," where items are allocated to agents in a way that maximizes the sum of the values each agent assigns to their allocated items. The algorithm follows these steps:

1. Calculate the total value each agent assigns to each item.
2. Allocate items to the agents in a manner that maximizes the total sum of values.

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for item 4 (89), item 3 (57), item 5 (53).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for item 7 (96), item 5 (71), item 4 (68).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for item 3 (92), item 1 (74), item 0 (72).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for item 1 (99), item 3 (96), item 5 (80).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for item 8 (52), item 3 (70), item 4 (41).

After evaluating the values and ensuring each agent receives at least one item and a fair distribution is achieved, we can allocate as follows:

- **Agent 0**: Item 4
- **Agent 1**: Item 7
- **Agent 2**: Item 3
- **Agent 3**: Item 1, Item 5
- **Agent 4**: Item 0, Item 2, Item 6, Item 8

Thus, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [0, 2, 6, 8]
}
```
