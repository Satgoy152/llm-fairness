Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74   3  64  16  79  99  17  72  29
1  63  54  23  97   9  52  57  70  73
2  27  75  33  42  12  93   5  41  64
3  99  22  46  66  71  12  68  38  12
4  46  56  68  16  14  21  92  87  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, ensuring no duplicate assignments.
2. Distribute remaining items based on the second-highest valuation that hasn't already been allocated.

Let's go through the steps:

1. Initial Assignment (highest-value item to each agent):
   - Agent 0: Item 5 (value 99)
   - Agent 1: Item 3 (value 97)
   - Agent 2: Item 1 (value 75)
   - Agent 3: Item 0 (value 99)
   - Agent 4: Item 6 (value 92)

2. Remaining items: 2, 4, 7, 8. Allocate based on second-highest values among remaining items:
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 79)
   - Agent 1: Item 8 (value 73)
   - Agent 2: Item 7 (value 41)
   - Agent 3: Item 2 (value 46)

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations. Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [3, 8],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [6]
}
```
