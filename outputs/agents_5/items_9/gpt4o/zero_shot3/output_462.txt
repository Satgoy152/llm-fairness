Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  15   4  62  91  57  89  33  30
1  56  80  20  31   0  83  40  13  40
2  20  51   4   0  87  68  18  80  77
3  76  36  28  97  60  89  91  53  72
4  44  22  21  34  46  25  42  41  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items. One approach to achieve this is to assign the highest-valued items to the agents who value them most, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Given the valuations provided, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 4, and 6.
2. **Agent 1** has high valuations for items 1 and 5.
3. **Agent 2** has high valuations for items 7 and 8.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 3 and 6.
5. **Agent 4** has relatively lower valuations but can take the remaining items.

Now, let's allocate items:

- **Agent 0** gets items 0 and 4 (valuations 75 and 91).
- **Agent 1** gets items 1 and 5 (valuations 80 and 83).
- **Agent 2** gets item 8 (valuation 77).
- **Agent 3** gets items 3 and 6 (valuations 97 and 91).
- **Agent 4** gets items 2 and 7 (valuations 21 and 41).

We have now allocated all items:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while trying to maximize their valuations based on the given table.
