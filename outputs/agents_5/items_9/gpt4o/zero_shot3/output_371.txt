Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  19  11   6  49  79  69  73  91
1  36  44  19  29  33  55  21  33  89
2  90  98  87  14  30  80  62  22  42
3  70  40   2   9  63   6   6   2  45
4  90  92  16  33  15  68  41  48  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of the agents for the items and aim to maximize the total satisfaction (value) each agent receives from their allocated items. Here is one approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total value each agent places on all items.
2. Allocate items based on the highest individual valuations to ensure fairness and maximize total satisfaction.
3. Ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, with all 9 items allocated.

Based on the given valuations, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 8.
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 5.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 0 and 1.

To fairly distribute, we can allocate as follows:

- Give agent 0 items 5 and 6.
- Give agent 1 item 8.
- Give agent 2 items 0 and 1.
- Give agent 3 item 4.
- Give agent 4 items 2, 3, and 7.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the agents, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and maximizing the overall satisfaction based on the valuations provided.
