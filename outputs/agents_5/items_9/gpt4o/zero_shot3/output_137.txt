Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  13  68  54  69  75  14  68  53
1  23  79   1   2  57  47  73  98  40
2  80  10  53  24  69  12  49  42  86
3   4  69  39  98  49  94  46  91  83
4  41  18  99  34  28  38  27  65  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes the total value each agent receives. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's determine the allocations step by step:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 2 with a value of 80.
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 1 with a value of 79.
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 4 with a value of 99.
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 3 with a value of 98.
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 0 with a value of 69.
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 0 with a value of 75.
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 1 with a value of 73.
- Item 7 is valued highest by agent 1 with a value of 98.
- Item 8 is valued highest by agent 2 with a value of 86.

Now, we can present the allocations in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1, 6, 7],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value most, and all 9 items are allocated.
