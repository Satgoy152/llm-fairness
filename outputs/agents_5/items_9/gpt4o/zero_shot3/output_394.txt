Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42   8   4  74  13  43  20  44   0
1  55  85  39  35  20  41   9  53  91
2   9  50  52  11  64  67  35  71   0
3  55  10  72  37  59  81  95  25  83
4  43  47  26  38   8  56  97  24  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation while also ensuring that all items are distributed. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Below is a step-by-step allocation:

1. List all items with their respective valuations by each agent.
2. For each item, find the agent who values it the most and assign the item to that agent.
3. If any agent ends up with more than their fair share of items (if the number of items is not divisible evenly among agents), redistribute the items.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on the given table:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most with 42.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with 85.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most with 72.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most with 74.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most with 64.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most with 81.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the most with 95.
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most with 71.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it the most with 91.

After assigning based on the highest valuation, here's the distribution:
- Agent 0: [0, 3]
- Agent 1: [1, 8]
- Agent 2: [4, 7]
- Agent 3: [2, 5, 6]
- Agent 4: []

Now, let's present this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [2, 5, 6],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets items according to their valuations where possible.
