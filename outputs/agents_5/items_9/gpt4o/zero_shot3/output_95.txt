Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26  21  96  69  11  48  62  40  58
1  11  63  13  43  83  27  50  55  13
2  69  22  91  36  11   2  38  10  34
3  42  16  35  88  99   1  24  31  95
4  85  80  73  40  85  47  34   9  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider distributing the items in a way that maximizes fairness. This can be achieved by giving each agent items that they value highly, while ensuring that each agent gets a reasonable share of the total value.

Given the valuations table, let's perform an allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 2 the highest among all items and has a second high value for item 0. We'll allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 the highest. We'll allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 the highest (same as agent 0), but item 2 is already taken. We'll allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 the highest, but it’s already taken. The next highest is item 3. We'll allocate item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 0 the highest (already taken by agent 2), so we check for the next highest, which is item 8. We'll allocate item 8 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to continue allocating until all 9 items are distributed:

6. **Agent 0**: After item 2, the next highest item is 5. We'll allocate item 5 to agent 0.
7. **Agent 1**: After item 4, the next highest value is item 1. We'll allocate item 1 to agent 1.
8. **Agent 3**: After item 3, the next highest value is item 8, but it’s already taken. The next is item 7. We'll allocate item 7 to agent 3.
9. **Agent 4**: After item 8, the next highest value is item 0 (already taken), then item 1 (already taken), then item 6. We'll allocate item 6 to agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each item is distributed and each agent receives an allocation based on their preferences as much as possible.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [8, 6]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 5 agents.
