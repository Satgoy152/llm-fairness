Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52   2  70  49   0  60  78  77   5
1  98  14  67  29  92  98  43  38  35
2  34  61  54  25  40  20  90  55  10
3   8  49  13  80  93   5  36  68   5
4  68  87  90  45  90  84  13   4  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their given valuations. We should ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. Let's go through a possible allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 6 (78), 7 (77), 2 (70)
   - Allocate item 6.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 0 (98), 5 (98), 4 (92)
   - Allocate items 0 and 5.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 6 (90), 1 (61), 7 (55)
   - Item 6 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 1.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 4 (93), 3 (80), 7 (68)
   - Allocate item 4.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value items: 2 (90), 4 (90), 1 (87)
   - Items 1 and 4 are already allocated.
   - Allocate items 2 and 8.

6. Remaining items: 3, 7.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 3.

Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 3],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [2, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives one or more items.
