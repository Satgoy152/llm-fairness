Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  67  83  48  87  57  29  61  84
1  90  54  47  53  34  31  65  39  52
2  92  41  79  28  55  29  43  71  29
3  75  58  38  63  23  52  30  58  42
4  89  47  85  35  52  60  85  76  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are distributed. We can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness in distribution.

Let's approach this by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of items.

### Allocation Strategy:
1. **Step 1**: Calculate the maximum valuation for each item across all agents.
2. **Step 2**: Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, while ensuring that the number of items assigned remains balanced among the agents.

### Allocation Process:
- Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, as long as it doesn't lead to all items being assigned to very few agents.

Here is a possible allocation that attempts to balance item distribution while respecting agent preferences:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 8 (valuation 84).
- **Agent 1**: Assign items 0 and 6 (valuations 90, 65).
- **Agent 2**: Assign items 2, 7 (valuations 79, 71).
- **Agent 3**: Assign items 3, 5 (valuations 63, 52).
- **Agent 4**: Assign items 1, 4 (valuations 47, 52).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
