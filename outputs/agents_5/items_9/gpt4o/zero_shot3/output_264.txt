Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  71  40  96  85  52  15  82  49
1  29  15   5  85  14  17  72  12  96
2  88  30   0  83  85  26  41  75  17
3  15  99  87  68  63  94  73  72  75
4  91  36  70  51  28   7  23  64   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents while considering their valuations, we can use a basic algorithm to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences. Given that there are more items than agents, some agents may receive more than one item. The goal is to maximize overall satisfaction, which can be approximated by assigning items to the agents who value them the most.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 91 by agent 4.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 99 by agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 87 by agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 96 by agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 85 by agents 0 and 2 (tie). Assign to agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 94 by agent 3.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 73 by agent 3.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 82 by agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 96 by agent 1.

Each item is assigned to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring all items are allocated. Let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4, 7
- Agent 1: Item 8
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 1, 2, 5, 6
- Agent 4: Item 0

Now, presenting the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4, 7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 2, 5, 6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
