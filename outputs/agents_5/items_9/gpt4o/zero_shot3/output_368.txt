Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  50   0   3  59  58  52  62  99
1  20  97  60  63  16  46  53  41  71
2   1  90  61  26  15   5  77  99  37
3  17  67  24  70  90  37   4   4  59
4  94  33  81  53  38  71  21  97  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a manner that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. We can approach this problem by considering each agent's highest-valued items and attempting to allocate them those items, moving to the next agent if that item has already been allocated. This method does not guarantee a perfectly fair allocation but tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction given the constraints.

Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:** They highly value item 8 (99), item 7 (62), and item 5 (58). Assign item 8 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 1 (97) and item 3 (63) highly. Assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 7 (99) and item 6 (77) highly. Assign item 7 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 4 (90) and item 3 (70) highly. Assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 0 (94) and item 7 (97) highly, but item 7 is already taken. Assign item 0 to agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 5, 6):

- **Agent 0:** Already has item 8, the next highest item is 5 (58). Assign item 5 to agent 0.
- **Agent 1:** Already has item 1, the next highest item is 3 (63). Assign item 3 to agent 1.
- **Agent 2:** Already has item 7, the next highest is item 6 (77). Assign item 6 to agent 2.
- **Agent 3:** Already has item 4, the next highest is item 3 (already taken), then item 8 (already taken), so no further allocation possible.
- **Agent 4:** Already has item 0, the next unallocated item is item 2 (81). Assign item 2 to agent 4.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they value highly while making sure all 9 items are distributed.
