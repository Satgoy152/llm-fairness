Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  56  53  88  16  69  85  66  82  43
1  34  68  80  51  37  27  48  62   3
2  29   4   1  80  24  68  16  20  61
3  39  72  69  55  23  83  14  97  61
4  43  45   3  75  60  37  27  21  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. We'll assign items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

Here is a step-by-step allocation approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (88) and 5 (85).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (80) and 1 (68).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is item 3 (80).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 7 (97) and 5 (83).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is item 3 (75).

Now, let's allocate accordingly, trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Item 2
- **Agent 1**: Item 1
- **Agent 2**: Item 3
- **Agent 3**: Items 7 and 5
- **Agent 4**: Item 4

Now, the remaining items (0, 6, 8) need to be allocated:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (next highest value)
- **Agent 1**: Item 6 (next highest value)
- **Agent 4**: Item 8 (next highest value)

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7, 5],
    "4": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, maximizing the value for each agent based on their individual valuations.
