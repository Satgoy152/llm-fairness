Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  64  94  15  87  48  79  69  88
1  86  19  22  57  68  50  29  79  46
2  10  98  26  72  17  24  61  53  75
3  15  32  72  28  42  38  38  56   7
4  26  21   6  45  57  11  85  76  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations for the items. We'll aim to balance the allocation so that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their preferences.

Here's one possible allocation that adheres to the constraints:

1. Agent 0 values items 2 and 8 highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 highly.

Based on these preferences, let's make an allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 8
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Items 1, 5
- Agent 3: Items 3, 7
- Agent 4: Item 6

Now, presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are allocated, and each agent receives items according to their preferences as much as possible.
