Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  77  89   1  18  19  67  86  95
1  72  57  52  32  46  69  50  71  43
2  85  10  85  51  24  41  46  74  81
3  57  23  29  76  10  95  27  24  51
4  10  68   9  31  52  75  66  28   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent places on the items and ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on these valuations. One way to achieve a fair allocation is to assign items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent, while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least some items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 2 and 8, so we assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values items 0 and 5 relatively high, so we assign these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 0, but since item 0 is already taken, we assign item 6, which is the next best for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 highly, but since item 5 is already taken, we assign item 3, which is the next best available for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has high valuations for items 4 and 5, but since item 5 is already taken, we assign item 4 to Agent 4.

With this, let's ensure all items are covered:

- Agent 0 gets items 2 and 8.
- Agent 1 gets items 0 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 6.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.

This leaves item 1 and item 7 unallocated. We can assign item 1 to Agent 0 and item 7 to Agent 2, as they have relatively higher valuations for these items compared to others.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8, 1],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
