Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  53  18  71  22   2  48  15  16
1  39  51  87  28  55  13  82  18  90
2  47  34  52  85  26  53  40  66  68
3  35  11  95  45  71  79  76  67  69
4  33  41  95  66  56  81  20  55  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a relatively balanced total valuation. This can be approached by considering each agent's highest valuations and attempting to optimize the total value they receive.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 2 (value 87) to agent 1, as it's their highest value.
2. Assign item 3 (value 85) to agent 2, as it's their highest value.
3. Assign item 5 (value 81) to agent 4, as it's their highest value.
4. Assign item 8 (value 90) to agent 1, as they value it highly.
5. Assign item 6 (value 76) to agent 3, as it's their highest value.
6. Assign item 0 (value 36) to agent 0, for a decent balance.
7. Assign item 1 (value 53) to agent 0, for a decent balance.
8. Assign item 4 (value 71) to agent 3, as they value it significantly.
9. Assign item 7 (value 67) to agent 3, as they value it significantly.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6, 4, 7],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are allocated, and there's an attempt at balance based on their valuations.
