Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  72  65  82  51  76  58  71  82
1  53  63  73  21  61   7  84   2  91
2  60  70  99  24   9  17  83  70  77
3  28  88  13  68  72  41  76   1  78
4  34  49  51  42  44  69  17  14  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their given valuations, while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [7, 3]
   - Item 7: Value 71
   - Item 3: Value 82
   - Total Value: 153

2. **Agent 1**: Items [8, 0]
   - Item 8: Value 91
   - Item 0: Value 53
   - Total Value: 144

3. **Agent 2**: Items [2, 6]
   - Item 2: Value 99
   - Item 6: Value 83
   - Total Value: 182

4. **Agent 3**: Items [1]
   - Item 1: Value 88
   - Total Value: 88

5. **Agent 4**: Items [4, 5]
   - Item 4: Value 44
   - Item 5: Value 69
   - Total Value: 113

This allocation attempts to distribute items to maximize agent satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 3],
    "1": [8, 0],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
