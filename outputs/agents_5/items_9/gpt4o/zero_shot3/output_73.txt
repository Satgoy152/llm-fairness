Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  46  32  16  47  74  70   4  66
1   4  77  50  25  98  60  77  95  70
2  74  55  50  30  58  45  63  49  74
3  16  63  68  59  21  32  39  70  45
4  68  42  99  78  93  51  54  17  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, one approach is to ensure that each agent gets at least some of the items they value highly. We can start by identifying the highest-valued items for each agent and try to allocate accordingly while ensuring each agent gets a fair share and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 the most with a value of 74.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the most with a value of 98.
3. Agent 2 values items 0 and 8 the most, both with a value of 74.
4. Agent 3 values item 7 the most with a value of 70.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most with a value of 99.

Now, we assign items based on these preferences, ensuring no item is assigned more than once and all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: 5, 0
- Agent 1: 4
- Agent 2: 8
- Agent 3: 7, 3
- Agent 4: 2, 1, 6

This distribution allocates all 9 items and gives each agent a fair share based on their preferences. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [7, 3],
    "4": [2, 1, 6]
}
```
