Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  39   4  16  17  20  18   3  84
1   2  62  11  32  29  77  36  73  28
2  65  21  98  27  56  60  74  57  44
3  35  24  20  77  66  19  17  30  39
4  49  54  97  46  78  17  71  59  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and each item is assigned to exactly one agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items.
2. Allocate items one by one, prioritizing the highest valuation for the remaining unallocated items.

Let's go through the allocation process step-by-step:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest value: Item 8 (value 84)
   - Allocation: Item 8

2. Agent 1:
   - Highest unallocated value: Item 5 (value 77)
   - Allocation: Item 5

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest unallocated value: Item 2 (value 98)
   - Allocation: Item 2

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest unallocated value: Item 3 (value 77)
   - Allocation: Item 3

5. Agent 4:
   - Highest unallocated value: Item 4 (value 78)
   - Allocation: Item 4

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 4 more items to ensure all 9 items are allocated. Let's continue:

6. Agent 0:
   - Highest unallocated value: Item 1 (value 39)
   - Allocation: Item 1

7. Agent 2:
   - Highest unallocated value: Item 6 (value 74)
   - Allocation: Item 6

8. Agent 3:
   - Highest unallocated value: Item 7 (value 30)
   - Allocation: Item 7

9. Agent 4:
   - Highest unallocated value: Item 0 (value 49)
   - Allocation: Item 0

Now every item is allocated, and each agent has received at least one item. The allocations can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4, 0]
}
```
