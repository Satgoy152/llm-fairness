Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  54   1  44  80  74  98  82   6
1  63  88  25  98  47  41  68  77  53
2  84   8  81  26  30   4  87  51  70
3  13  72  89  42  95  36  71  71  65
4  20  38  90  64  83  70  93  34  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent gets from their allocated items, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We will use a simple greedy strategy to achieve this:

1. First, we will calculate the total number of items each agent should receive. Since there are 5 agents and 9 items, most agents will receive 2 items, and one agent will receive 1 item.

2. We will then allocate the items based on the highest value each agent has for an item, ensuring that the total number of items allocated matches the constraints.

Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 5 and 6.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives items 0 and 8.
- Agent 3 receives items 4 and 7.
- Agent 4 receives item 2.

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```
