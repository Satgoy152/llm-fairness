Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  38  22  70  75  41  23  54  54
1  44  33  87  93  93   1  76  29  23
2  19   3  27   8  69  13  24  33  14
3  41  70  81  83  38  47  17  11  35
4  33  91  79  12  27  25  64  92  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and every item is allocated. Here's one way to achieve a balanced distribution:

1. Calculate the total value each agent can potentially receive if they were to get their best-valued items.
2. Distribute the items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, given the number of agents and items.

Following this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has relatively high values for items 0, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 values items 2, 3, and 4 highly.
- Agent 2 has moderate valuations across items but no significant peaks.
- Agent 3 values items 1, 2, and 3 highly.
- Agent 4 has high values for items 1 and 7.

Based on this distribution, we can allocate the items as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. Each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.
