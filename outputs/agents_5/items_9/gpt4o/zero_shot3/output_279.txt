Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  48  85  21  81  70  48  37  32
1  81  38  14  49  78  92  68  39  14
2   6   6  53  35  76  30  54  44  23
3  42  56  21  56   8  52   7  83  86
4  25  56  17  47  98   8  33  22   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider a distribution where each agent receives a reasonable number of items, ideally maximizing their valuations. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Each agent should receive at least one item since there are more items than agents. However, since there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will have more than one item.

2. We start by assigning the highest valued items to agents, ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We'll make adjustments as needed to ensure all items are allocated.

Here is a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 0, 4
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Items 3, 8
- Agent 4: Items 1, 7

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents. Now, let's represent this in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.
