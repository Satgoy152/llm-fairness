Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  99  51  79   6  31  97   1  53
1  37  98   5  83  46  42  80   8  52
2  14  58  83  78  43  49  16  98  80
3  15  45  32  93  92  34   9  93  42
4  53  94  72  18  31  75  45   0  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. One approach to achieve fairness is to use the "max-min fairness" principle, where each agent receives items that maximize the minimum valuation they get. However, given the nature of this task, I will ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, and 6. Allocating item 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for items 1 and 3. Allocating item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has high valuations for items 2 and 7. Allocating item 7.
4. **Agent 3**: Has high valuations for items 3 and 7. Allocating item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has high valuations for items 1, 4, and 8. Allocating item 4.

Now that each agent has at least one item, we allocate the remaining items based on the highest unallocated valuations:

6. **Agent 2**: Also values item 8 highly. Allocating item 8.
7. **Agent 0**: Also values item 0 highly. Allocating item 0.
8. **Agent 3**: Also values item 5 highly. Allocating item 5.
9. **Agent 4**: Also values item 2 highly. Allocating item 2.

This distribution ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and exactly 9 items are allocated in total.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```
