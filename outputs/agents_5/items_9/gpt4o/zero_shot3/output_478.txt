Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  13  47  61  20  54  33   3  52
1  97  40   2  27  27  79  26  50  81
2  67  26  57  83  48  43  16  54  10
3  11  22  11  98  83  32  46  57  28
4  76  89  53  89  13  19   3  77  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and distribute the items in a way that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the valuations:

1. Assign items to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and no agent receives more than necessary.

2. Given there are 9 items and 5 agents, at least four agents will receive 2 items, and one agent will receive 1 item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (61), and also has high values for item 5 (54).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (97) and item 8 (81).
- Agent 2 values item 3 (83) highly, but since agent 0 has already taken it, we look at item 2 (57) and item 7 (54).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest but it's taken, so we check item 4 (83) and item 7 (57).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (89) and item 3 (89) but it's taken, so we consider item 0 (76).

Considering these points, here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a reasonable number of items based on their valuations.
