Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  83  87  82  83  51  55  74  22   0
1  94   1  60  11  70  18  17  73  19
2  51  99  89  16  83  17  69  72  92
3  98  78  41  38  93  88  32  96  66
4  95  83  21  36  68  45  78  34  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. We aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s one possible approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Items with high valuation: [0, 1, 3] (Values: 83, 87, 83)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Items with high valuation: [4] (Value: 70)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Items with high valuation: [2, 8] (Values: 89, 92)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Items with high valuation: [7] (Value: 96)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Items with high valuation: [5, 6] (Values: 45, 78)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets items according to their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```
