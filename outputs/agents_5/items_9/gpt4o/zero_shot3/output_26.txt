Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  86  89  59  44  15  82   3  20
1  98   3  63  20  43  50  83   6  53
2  31  57  53  63  88  33   2  72  91
3  32  62  86  25  82  26  71  83  32
4  11   1  40   9  49  45   7  48  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent can receive zero or more items.

Let's start by assigning items based on the highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Item 0: 99 (highest value for agent 0)
   - Item 1: 86 (second-highest value for agent 0)

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Item 6: 83 (highest value for agent 1)

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Item 8: 91 (highest value for agent 2)
   - Item 4: 88 (second-highest value for agent 2)

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Item 7: 83 (highest value for agent 3)
   - Item 2: 86 (second-highest value for agent 3)

5. **Agent 4**:  
   - Item 5: 45 (highest value for agent 4)
   - Item 3: 9 (remaining item)

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [2, 7],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, agents are allocated items based on their highest valuations, and each agent has at least the possibility of receiving some items.
