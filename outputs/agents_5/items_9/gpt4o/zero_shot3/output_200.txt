Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  24  48  39  47  38  74  80  42
1  91   5  33  83  29  55  36  58  59
2  81  45   6  51  19  69  95   4  72
3  43  61  34  69  54  23  34  25  33
4  90  94  38  41  92  63  34  83  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing the total valuation for each agent, we can use a greedy approach. In this method, we will assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 91 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 94 by Agent 4.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 48 by Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 83 by Agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 92 by Agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 69 by Agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: The highest value is 95 by Agent 2.
8. **Item 7**: The highest value is 83 by Agent 4.
9. **Item 8**: The highest value is 82 by Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate these items to each agent based on the above findings:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 3]
- Agent 2: [5, 6]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [1, 4, 7, 8]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 4, 7, 8]
}
```
