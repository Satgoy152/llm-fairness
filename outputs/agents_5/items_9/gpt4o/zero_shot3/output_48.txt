Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  26  40  63  11  23   8  99  17
1  99   6  72  66  67  68  29   7  97
2  70  18  55  73  18  73  16   2   3
3   1  79  14  68  79  33  97  13  77
4  25   4  33  13  62   0  97  36  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to distribute the 9 items to 5 agents as equitably as possible.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Agent**: Look for the item each agent values the most and allocate that item to the respective agent if possible.
2. **Distribute Remaining Items**: Allocate the remaining items to agents who have fewer items or have the highest relative valuation for those items.

Let's work through this:

- **Agent 0** values item 7 the most (99).
- **Agent 1** values item 0 the most (99).
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the most (73).
- **Agent 3** values item 6 the most (97).
- **Agent 4** values item 6 the most (97), but since item 6 is allocated to Agent 3, we look for the next highest, which is item 8 (76).

Now, allocate the remaining items based on what's left and try to balance the number of items each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 7, also highly values item 3 (63).
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 0, also values item 8 (97), but it's already taken by Agent 4. So, we give item 5 (68).
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 3, values item 5 next (73), but it's already taken by Agent 1. So, we give item 2 (55).
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 6, also values item 4 (79).
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 8, also values item 4 (62), but it's already taken by Agent 3. So, we give item 1 (4).

Finally, let's ensure that all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item:

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 2],
    "3": [6, 4],
    "4": [8, 1]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and distributes all 9 items.
