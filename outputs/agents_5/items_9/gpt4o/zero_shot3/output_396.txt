Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54  95  93  20  43   9  61  43  20
1  30  85  69  83   8  16  84  62  15
2  79  44  94   0   3   0  18  82  82
3  18  98  18  65  95  40  92   6  32
4  59  36  60  65   8  39  21   2  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can apply a simple greedy algorithm. This method involves iterating through each item and assigning it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item whenever possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0 is most valued by agent 2 (79).
2. Item 1 is most valued by agent 3 (98).
3. Item 2 is most valued by agent 2 (94), but agent 2 already has item 0. The next highest value is by agent 0 (93).
4. Item 3 is most valued by agent 1 (83).
5. Item 4 is most valued by agent 3 (95), but agent 3 already has item 1. The next highest value is by agent 0 (43).
6. Item 5 is most valued by agent 3 (40), but agent 3 already has item 1. The next highest is agent 4 (39).
7. Item 6 is most valued by agent 3 (92), but agent 3 already has item 1. The next highest is agent 1 (84).
8. Item 7 is most valued by agent 2 (82), but agent 2 already has item 0. The next highest is agent 1 (62), but agent 1 already has item 3. The next highest is agent 0 (43).
9. Item 8 is most valued by agent 2 (82), but agent 2 already has item 0. The next highest is agent 3 (32), but agent 3 already has item 1. The next highest is agent 0 (20).

After checking for conflicts and ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 7],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that every agent gets at least one item and that we have allocated all 9 items as required.
