Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  25  44  50  96  63  59  74  19
1  83  61  12  89   7  51  27  38  42
2  80  71  96  55   2  91  48  48  17
3  89  71  64  71  40  28  91  59  99
4  81  94  17  83  18  54  32  26  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the satisfaction of agents based on their valuations. One common approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's go through the items one by one and allocate them to the agent who values them the most:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most at 94.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 96.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 89.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values it the most at 91.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it the most at 91.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 3 values it the most at 99.

Now let's summarize the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [1]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, respecting their preferences as much as possible.
