Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  24  17  72  38  55  66  26  55
1  17  86  14  34  14  41  24  59  56
2  43  33  76  30  72   4  81  75   8
3  99  99   3  63  81  27  28  39  88
4  54  29  84  68  32  85  37   5   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations, prioritizing assignments that maximize the overall value for each agent.
2. Ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 3 (72) and item 0 (55), so we can assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (86), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (81), so assign item 6 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 and item 1 both at 99, but since item 1 is already taken, assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most (85), so assign item 5 to Agent 4.
- Agent 4 also has a high valuation for item 2 (84), so assign item 2 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3, who values it at 81.
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2, who values it at 75.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3, who values it at 88.

This allocation maximizes each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [0, 4, 8],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```
