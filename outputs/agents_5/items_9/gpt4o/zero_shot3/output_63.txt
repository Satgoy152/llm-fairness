Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95   6  85  95  95  84  28  69  37
1  28  31   8  30  89  18   3  98  47
2  53  82  99  99  55  50  31  77  98
3  67  47   3  29  43  11  40  75  64
4  78  48  54  48  17  66  28  63  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute them such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their preferences. It's important to ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and that all items are allocated.

One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring a balanced distribution:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it at 95, which is the highest.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it at 82, which is the highest.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it at 99, which is the highest.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 2 values it at 99, which is the highest.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it at 95, which is the highest.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it at 84, which is the highest.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 3 values it at 40, which is the highest.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 1 values it at 98, which is the highest.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 4 values it at 93, which is the highest.

Based on this allocation, we distribute the items to ensure each agent gets a share:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4, and 5
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2, and 3
- Agent 3: Item 6
- Agent 4: Item 8

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4, 5],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1, 2, 3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item.
