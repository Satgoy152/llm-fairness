Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17   6  53  43  11  88  26  57  83
1  79  98  37  56  87  67  53  48   1
2  69  53  17   4  98  59  11  67  26
3  59   4  58  38  48  49  72  73  80
4  34  13  28  38  79   2  88  67   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. A potential approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent is left without an item if possible. Let's go through the process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 79. Assign to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 98. Assign to Agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 53. Assign to Agent 0.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 0 values it at 43, but Agent 1 values it higher at 56. Assign to Agent 1.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 98. Assign to Agent 2.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 88. Assign to Agent 0.

7. **Item 6**:
   - Agent 4 values it the highest at 88. Assign to Agent 4.

8. **Item 7**:
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 73. Assign to Agent 3.

9. **Item 8**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 83. Assign to Agent 0.

Now, we need to ensure that every agent gets at least one item and that exactly 9 items are assigned. Agents 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been assigned at least one item. However, Agent 0 has been assigned multiple items, so no adjustment is needed. Thus, the allocation can be presented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 8],
    "1": [0, 1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items, and all 9 items are distributed.
