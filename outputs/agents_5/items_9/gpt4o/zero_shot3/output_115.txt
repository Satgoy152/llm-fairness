Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  97  68   7  73  43  79   4  62
1  43  11  47  74  70   6  37  36   4
2  18  20  97  77  22  82  22  16  54
3  88  70  76  92  20  61   7  61  69
4  99  86  58  45  54  77  62  63  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation method that tries to maximize the value each agent receives:

1. Start by assigning items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item.
2. Ensure each agent receives a fair share of items, adjusting if necessary.

Let's analyze the table to allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most (99).
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most (97).
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (97).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (92).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (73).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most (82).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (79).
- Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most (63).
- Item 8: Agent 3 values it the most (69).

Now let's distribute these items:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 4, 6
- Agent 1: No items (lowest bids overall)
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5
- Agent 3: Items 3, 8
- Agent 4: Items 0, 7

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4, 6],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [0, 7]
}
```
