Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  17  16  63  26  54  49  90  64
1  12   1  46   9  86  77  69  81  21
2  13  82  28  91  37  18  16  54  69
3  46  93  36  52   2  99   6  57  72
4  33  54  32  57   4  95  62  40  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0:** High values for items 0, 7.
2. **Agent 1:** High value for item 4.
3. **Agent 2:** High value for item 3.
4. **Agent 3:** High values for items 1, 5.
5. **Agent 4:** High values for items 2, 8.

The allocation process:

- Allocate item 0 to agent 0 (value: 92).
- Allocate item 1 to agent 3 (value: 93).
- Allocate item 2 to agent 4 (value: 32).
- Allocate item 3 to agent 2 (value: 91).
- Allocate item 4 to agent 1 (value: 86).
- Allocate item 5 to agent 3 (value: 99).
- Allocate item 6 to agent 0 (value: 49).
- Allocate item 7 to agent 0 (value: 90).
- Allocate item 8 to agent 4 (value: 34).

This allocation ensures that every agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated equals 9.

Here is the resulting allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [2, 8]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated items in a way that considers their highest valuations, while ensuring a fair distribution of items.
