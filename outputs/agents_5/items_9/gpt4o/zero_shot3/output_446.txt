Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   9  16  61  57  31  39  55   3  63
1  38  91  35  60  46  80  14  23  95
2  59  77  82  39  87  22  25  11  56
3  56  42  80  96  92  76  81  72  30
4  92  39  30  35  82  57  26  15  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation of the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. This approach helps in ensuring fairness by allowing each agent to get the items they value the most. Below is one possible way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 8 (63), Item 2 (61)
   - Allocate items 2 and 8 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 8 (95), Item 1 (91)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (82), Item 4 (87)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 3 (96), Item 4 (92)
   - Allocate items 3 and 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (92), Item 4 (82)
   - Allocate items 0, 5, and 7 to Agent 4.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [0, 5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, considering their preferences as much as possible.
