Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76   5  15  18  76  95  87  74  15
1  67  58  48  73  66  51  37  82  89
2  68  42  74  29  54   4  34   8  34
3  56  25  24  27   7  13  85  54  83
4  54  18  11  27  77   2  17  60  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. A fair allocation can be approached by maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are distributed.

One approach is to use a method called "round-robin" or "sequential allocation," where we sequentially assign items based on the highest remaining value for each agent. This method helps distribute items in a way that considers each agent's preferences.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest value item is 5 (95), assign item 5.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest value item is 8 (89), assign item 8.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest value item is 2 (74), assign item 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest value item is 6 (85), assign item 6.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest value item is 4 (77), assign item 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items. We continue with the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0:** Next highest value item is 4 (76), but it is already taken. Next is item 0 (76), assign item 0.
7. **Agent 1:** Next highest value item is 3 (73), assign item 3.
8. **Agent 2:** Next highest value item is 0 (68), assign item 0. But item 0 is taken, so we look for next. Item 4 (54) is taken. Item 1 (42) is available, assign item 1.
9. **Agent 3:** Next highest value item is 8 (83), assign item 8. But item 8 is taken, so we look for next. Item 7 (54) is available, assign item 7.

Now all items are allocated. The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [8, 3],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items to the agents based on their highest preferences in a sequential manner.
