Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  85  24  60  50  44  89  58  11
1  30  12  73  83  21   2  25  80  38
2  67  53   6  96  85  53  77  46  75
3   7  32  60  34  73  56  25  66  16
4  24  96   4  84  32  90  24  31  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of allocated items equals 9. A potential approach is to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. Let's work through this:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [5, 85, 24, 60, 50, 44, 89, 58, 11]
   - Highest values: Item 6 (89), Item 1 (85), Item 3 (60)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [30, 12, 73, 83, 21, 2, 25, 80, 38]
   - Highest values: Item 3 (83), Item 2 (73), Item 7 (80)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [67, 53, 6, 96, 85, 53, 77, 46, 75]
   - Highest values: Item 3 (96), Item 4 (85), Item 6 (77)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [7, 32, 60, 34, 73, 56, 25, 66, 16]
   - Highest values: Item 4 (73), Item 7 (66), Item 2 (60)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Values: [24, 96, 4, 84, 32, 90, 24, 31, 30]
   - Highest values: Item 1 (96), Item 5 (90), Item 3 (84)

Let's assign items based on the highest values ensuring no item is assigned more than once and each agent gets a fair share:

- Assign Item 6 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 4.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 4.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable share of items according to their valuations.
