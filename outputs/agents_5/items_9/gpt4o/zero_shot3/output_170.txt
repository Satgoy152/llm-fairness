Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  31  90   5  72  90  60   9  36
1   8  70  70  72  53   9   0  92  69
2  68  65  38  71  46  74  22   1  93
3  36  41  73   3  35  70  25  82  33
4  61  38  92  74  42  36  18  21  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 8 70 70 72 53  9  0 92 69]
 [68 65 38 71 46 74 22  1 93]
 [36 41 73  3 35 70 25 82 33]
 [61 38 92 74 42 36 18 21 60]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the table, we will allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent where possible.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (90), Item 5 (90)
   - Allocation: [2, 5]

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (92), Item 3 (72), Item 1 (70)
   - Allocation: [7, 3]

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 8 (93), Item 5 (74)
   - Allocation: [8]

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (82), Item 5 (70)
   - Allocation: [1]

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (92), Item 3 (74), Item 0 (61)
   - Allocation: [0, 4, 6]

Now, let's finalize the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
