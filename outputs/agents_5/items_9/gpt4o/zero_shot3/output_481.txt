Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  93  24  47  66   9  29  68  19  87
1  59  13  52  85  87  81  30  88  84
2  42  17  90  44  93  46  66  97  68
3  80  99  97  49  56  89  21  71   0
4  25  50  90  76  47  41  81  76  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value of the items each agent receives is reasonably balanced. We need to be mindful of each agent's values for the items while ensuring all 9 items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly, so allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 and 4 highly, so allocate items 3 and 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 and 7 highly, so allocate items 2 and 7 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 and 5 highly, so allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 6 and 8 highly, so allocate items 6 and 8 to Agent 4.

Now, let's format this allocation into the required JSON structure:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 7],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets some items, and all 9 items are allocated.
