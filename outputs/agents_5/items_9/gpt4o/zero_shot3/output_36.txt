Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  30  44  54  89  92  63  89  45
1  61  96  41  53  14  94  79  23  64
2  48  67  53  48  58  24  71   1  96
3  52  63  14  56  32  31  91  38  88
4  96  43  89  22  58  14  88  84  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [96 43 89 22 58 14 88 84 44]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent may receive different numbers of items. 

Let's allocate items based on maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: 0, 5
   - Total value: 92 + 92 = 184

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: 1, 3
   - Total value: 96 + 53 = 149

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: 8
   - Total value: 96

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: 6
   - Total value: 91

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items: 2, 4, 7
   - Total value: 89 + 58 + 84 = 231

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to exactly one agent, and each agent receives a reasonable number of items given their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [2, 4, 7]
}
```
