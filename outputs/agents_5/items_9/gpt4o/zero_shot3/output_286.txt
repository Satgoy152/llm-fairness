Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  61  40  72  16  70  94  12  92
1  71  29  88  39  37  11  29  81   3
2  75  56  13  98  29  62  39  11  34
3  26  41  83  65  52  91  82   1   7
4  45  59  69  86  51  49  25  78  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we aim to maximize the total happiness of all agents by assigning items based on their highest individual valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations for items 6, 8, and 0. Assign items 6 and 8 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations for items 5 and 2 (which is already taken). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 8 (already taken), and then item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, ensure all items are allocated, and no agent has more than their fair share:

- Remaining unassigned items: 0, 1, and 7.

Let's reassign or assign the remaining items:

- **Agent 0** already has 2 items (6 and 8).
- **Agent 1** only has 1 item, so assign item 1.
- **Agent 2** only has 1 item, so assign item 0.
- **Agent 3** only has 1 item, so assign item 7.

Now, every agent has either 1 or 2 items, and all items are allocated.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3, 0],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```
This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.
