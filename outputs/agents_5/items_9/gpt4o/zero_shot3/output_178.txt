Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67   4  16  23  69   2  15  41  55
1  86  43  22  59  57  97  21  45  98
2  93  22  76  55  40  48  35  70   9
3  88  72  39  49  60  67  38  42  19
4  36  45  28  99  48  71  81  69  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent gets a reasonable value based on their preferences. Let's examine the given valuations and attempt to assign items in a way that balances the total value each agent receives.

Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 0, 4
   - Total value = 67 (for item 0) + 69 (for item 4) = 136
2. **Agent 1**: Items 5, 8
   - Total value = 97 (for item 5) + 98 (for item 8) = 195
3. **Agent 2**: Items 1, 2
   - Total value = 22 (for item 1) + 76 (for item 2) = 98
4. **Agent 3**: Items 3, 6
   - Total value = 49 (for item 3) + 38 (for item 6) = 87
5. **Agent 4**: Item 7
   - Total value = 69 (for item 7)

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution attempts to give each agent a relatively fair total value.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
