Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  82  61  87  31  24  34  65  82
1  81  28  77  92  75   1  79  71  28
2  50  30   1  87  98  12  40  93  92
3  11  50  23  13   6  77  10  31  79
4  62  73  13   5  98   8  62  68   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that the allocation maximizes the total valuation for each agent. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item that hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Continue allocating remaining items in a way that attempts to balance the total value among the agents.

Let's start the allocation process:

- Agent 0's highest value is for item 3 (87).
- Agent 1's highest value is for item 3 (92), but it's already allocated, so the next highest is for item 0 (81).
- Agent 2's highest value is for item 4 (98).
- Agent 3's highest value is for item 5 (77).
- Agent 4's highest value is for item 4 (98), but it's already allocated, so the next highest is for item 1 (73).

Now, allocate remaining items:

- Assign Agent 0 item 1 (82) to complement their allocation.
- Assign Agent 1 item 2 (77) to complement their allocation.
- Assign Agent 2 item 8 (92) to complement their allocation.
- Assign Agent 3 item 7 (31) to complement their allocation.
- Assign Agent 4 item 6 (62) to complement their allocation.

Now let's compile the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the sum of their respective valuations.
