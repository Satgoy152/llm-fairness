Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  92  11  63  94   0   7  33  29  31
1  57  73  51  65  45   0  79  29  49
2  81   5  69  97  61  48  39  24  61
3  92  17  98  68   5  81  88  75  89
4  62  81  41  55  42  43  23  46  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 6 the most. Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most, but it is already taken. Item 2 is next highest, so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the most, but it is already taken. Item 0 is next highest, so allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most. Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
6. To continue allocating remaining items, prioritize based on remaining high-valued items for agents who haven't received one yet or have a low total value.

By following this strategy and ensuring all items are allocated, here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 8, 5],
    "4": [1, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and agents receive items they value highly.
