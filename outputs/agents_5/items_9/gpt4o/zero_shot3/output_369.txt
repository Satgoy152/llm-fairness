Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27   9  28  80  64  81  97  95  35
1   7  43  52   4  70  19  37  61   9
2  32  76  73  57  38   4  94  31   9
3   3  86  24  22  45  10  27  83  19
4  47  45  97  73  73  71  80  16  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. This means each agent should get items that they value highly, and the total number of items distributed should be exactly 9. Here's one approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Identify the highest value each agent assigns to any item and allocate that item to them if it has not already been taken.
2. Continue this process, ensuring each agent gets items they value highly.
3. Ensure all 9 items are allocated, with each agent getting an integer number of items.

Letâ€™s go through the allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 6 highest at 97.
- Agent 1 values item 4 highest at 70.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highest at 94, but it's already taken by Agent 0. So, allocate item 1, which is valued next highest at 76.
- Agent 3 values item 1 highest at 86, but it's taken by Agent 2. So, allocate item 7, which is valued next highest at 83.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highest at 97.

At this point, each agent has one item, and 4 items are allocated. We need to allocate the remaining 5 items:

- Agent 0 can take item 5, valued at 81.
- Agent 1 can take item 2, valued at 52.
- Agent 2 can take item 0, valued at 32.
- Agent 3 can take item 4, valued at 45.
- Agent 4 can take item 3, valued at 73.

This allocation gives:

- Agent 0: items 6, 5
- Agent 1: items 4, 2
- Agent 2: items 1, 0
- Agent 3: items 7, 3
- Agent 4: item 2

Now, let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [7, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly, and exactly 9 items are distributed.
