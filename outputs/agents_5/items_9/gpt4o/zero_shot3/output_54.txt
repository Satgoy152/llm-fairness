Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  81  81  14   4  41  67  39  25
1  58  84  74  27  83  48  58  11  32
2  27  90  26   3   8  36  45  45   6
3  71  14  12  98  77  60  33  64  88
4  68  42  67   5  35  88  19  30  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we should consider distributing the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given that we have 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll aim for an allocation that provides the maximum satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Here's a potential allocation strategy based on maximizing each agent's total value:

1. **Agent 0**: Items 1 and 2 (values: 81, 81)
2. **Agent 1**: Items 4 and 0 (values: 83, 58)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 8 (value: 6)
4. **Agent 3**: Items 3 and 7 (values: 98, 64)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 5 and 6 (values: 88, 19)

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```
