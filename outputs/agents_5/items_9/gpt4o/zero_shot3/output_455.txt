Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  77  85  87  11  15   3  95  85
1   7  94  89  10  61  28  74  96  86
2  32  30  73  35  79  63  30  89  78
3  18   7  87  83  46  68  79  97  44
4  80  61   8  94  68  63  44  96  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent's preferences are taken into account while ensuring that all items are allocated. We'll aim to maximize each agent's happiness based on their valuations.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Items: [0, 7]
   - Total valuation: 38 + 95 = 133

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Items: [1, 2]
   - Total valuation: 94 + 89 = 183

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Items: [4, 8]
   - Total valuation: 79 + 78 = 157

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Items: [5, 6]
   - Total valuation: 68 + 79 = 147

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Items: [3]
   - Total valuation: 94

This allocation is determined by considering the highest valuations in each row and trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction with their assigned items, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [3]
}
```
