Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49   6  35  53  96  29  51  27  13
1  74  25  28  96  73  67  58  97  51
2  65  25  87  97  41  52  95  75  85
3   3  80  83  30   5  47  57   2  64
4  25  63  64  85  16  17   0  60   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a strategy where each agent receives the items that they value the most, ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent. Here is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Values: [49, 6, 35, 53, 96, 29, 51, 27, 13]
   - Highest-valued item: Item 4 (value 96)
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values: [74, 25, 28, 96, 73, 67, 58, 97, 51]
   - Highest-valued item: Item 7 (value 97)
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values: [65, 25, 87, 97, 41, 52, 95, 75, 85]
   - Highest-valued item: Item 3 (value 97)
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values: [3, 80, 83, 30, 5, 47, 57, 2, 64]
   - Highest-valued item: Item 2 (value 83)
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Values: [25, 63, 64, 85, 16, 17, 0, 60, 0]
   - Highest-valued item: Item 3 (value 85), but already taken. Next highest is Item 2 (value 64), but also taken. Next highest is Item 1 (value 63).
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 4.

Next, we need to allocate the remaining items: 0, 5, 6, and 8. We will assign these based on the remaining highest values or distribute them to balance item count among agents as evenly as possible:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Highest remaining valuation is Agent 1 (74).
  - Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

- **Item 5**:
  - Highest remaining valuation is Agent 1 (67).
  - Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

- **Item 6**:
  - Highest remaining valuation is Agent 2 (95).
  - Allocate item 6 to agent 2.

- **Item 8**:
  - Highest remaining valuation is Agent 2 (85).
  - Allocate item 8 to agent 2.

Finally, let's check the allocation and ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [7, 0, 5]
- Agent 2: [3, 6, 8]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [1]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [7, 0, 5],
    "2": [3, 6, 8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
