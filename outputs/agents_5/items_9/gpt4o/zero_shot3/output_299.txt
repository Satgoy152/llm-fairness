Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  32  63  61  13  65  12  58  74
1  94  35  62  77  32  53  67  16  68
2   5  61  83  12  91  51  63  59  45
3  84  84  58  22  67  52  46   7   9
4  71  80  26  88  74  57  20  61  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to consider the valuations and distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Given the data, let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Preferably gets item 8 (value 74) and item 0 (value 68).
2. **Agent 1**: Gets item 3 (value 77) and item 0 (if available) or the next high-value item.
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 4 (value 91) and item 2 (value 83).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 1 (value 84) and item 0 (if not taken) or the next high-value item.
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 3 (value 88) and item 1 (value 80).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [0, 8]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [4, 2]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [5, 6, 7]

This distribution ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.

The final allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
