Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  51  19   6  34  99  52  42  22
1  95  22  30  99  75  65  26  42  29
2   1  32  78  83  13  98   2   8  63
3  94  94  86  39  76  37  86  41   7
4  83  66  10  72   6  24  88   2  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value each agent receives. We'll distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets a roughly equal share of their perceived value.

Hereâ€™s one way to allocate:

1. Begin by identifying the highest valuations for each item across all agents.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 1 (95).
- Item 1 is valued highest by agents 3 (94) and 4 (66), so we will assign it to agent 3.
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 3 (86).
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 1 (99).
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 1 (75).
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 0 (99).
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 4 (88).
- Item 7 is valued highest by agent 0 (42) and agent 3 (41), so we will assign it to agent 0.
- Item 8 is valued highest by agent 4 (87).

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 2: No item allocated yet
- Agent 3: Items 1, 2
- Agent 4: Items 6, 8

To ensure each agent gets at least one item, we can transfer one item from agent 1 to agent 2:

- Transfer item 4 from agent 1 to agent 2.

Now each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 7
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 1, 2
- Agent 4: Items 6, 8

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [6, 8]
}
```
