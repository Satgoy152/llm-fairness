Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  80  88  39  71  90  87  36  97
1  98  86  56  67  34  92  73   6  37
2  75  22   0   3  38  32  48  54  21
3  22  23  67  68  73  46  21  78  94
4   4  56  72  85  57  95  64  88  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Since there are 5 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others. We'll aim for a balanced allocation where each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 8 highly (97). We'll allocate this item to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 highly (98). We'll allocate this item to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 highly (75), but since it's already allocated, we'll choose item 6 (48) as it is the next highest unallocated.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 8 highly (94), but since it's already allocated, we'll choose item 7 (78) as it is the next highest unallocated.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 1 highly (56), so we'll allocate this item to agent 4.

Continuing to allocate the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0**: Allocate item 5 (90) to agent 0 as it has a high valuation.
7. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 3 (67) to agent 1 as it has a high valuation.
8. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 4 (73) to agent 3 as it has a high valuation.
9. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 2 (72) to agent 4 as it is unallocated and has a high valuation for this agent.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7, 4],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item according to their preferences.
