Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  72  81  99  43   7   3  89  40
1  36  62  71  87  62  10  43  45  38
2  98  37  13   6  31  98   1  30  43
3  16  39  87  89  86  75  62  97  91
4   7  98  74  27  38  18  22  13  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed. We'll use a strategy to allocate items to the agent valuing them the most, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Make sure each agent gets a fair share, considering their total valuation distribution.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 2 (valuation 98)
- Item 1: Agent 4 (valuation 98)
- Item 2: Agent 0 (valuation 81)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (valuation 99)
- Item 4: Agent 3 (valuation 86)
- Item 5: Agent 2 (valuation 98)
- Item 6: Agent 3 (valuation 62)
- Item 7: Agent 3 (valuation 97)
- Item 8: Agent 3 (valuation 91)

Now ensure each agent has an integer number of items and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: Items 4, 6, 7, 8
- Agent 4: Item 1

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4, 6, 7, 8],
    "4": [1]
}
```
