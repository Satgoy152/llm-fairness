Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  55  24  66  55  55  86  88  97
1   5  34  43  69  78  70  71  77   1
2  36  62  23  99   4   1  43  34  22
3  97  79  37  35  40   0  88  25  26
4  37   8  25  66  60  70  59  32  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider a distribution that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all 9 items are distributed. Here's one way to do it:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent across all items.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair number of items.

Let's try this approach:

**Item Allocation Steps:**

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it most (97)
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it most (79)
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it most (37)
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it most (99)
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it most (78)
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it most (70)
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it most (86)
- Item 7: Agent 0 values it most (88)
- Item 8: Agent 0 values it most (97)

Now, let's reassign to ensure all agents get a fair share:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 7, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [4]
- Agent 2: Items [3]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 1, 2]
- Agent 4: Items [5]

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 8],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1, 2],
    "4": [5]
}
```
