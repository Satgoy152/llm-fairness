Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  88  49  57  89  19  59  56   9
1  17  82  98  61   6  49   9   0  50
2  57  55  65  33  99  19  32  80  56
3  23  45  54  56   9  67  31  74  20
4  54  34  44   3  88  38  11  82  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that considers the agents' valuations and ensures each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's an allocation that distributes all 9 items among the 5 agents:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 4.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 and 7 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 and 7 highly.
5. Agent 4 has moderate valuations across various items.

Here is a suggested allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4 (high values for these items)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (highest value for this item)
- Agent 2: Items 6 and 8
- Agent 3: Items 5 and 7
- Agent 4: Items 0 and 3

This allocation attempts to give each agent items they value relatively highly while ensuring all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```
