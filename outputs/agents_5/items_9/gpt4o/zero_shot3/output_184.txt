Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  10  43   9  38  95   2  21  36
1  87  41  33  34  17  66  68  53  52
2  41  62  62   7  74  94  15  82  82
3   2  61  94  98  47  58  32  53  86
4  60  59  19   1  33  81  58  76  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. We will try to balance the distribution based on the valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest, so we allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest, so we allocate item 0 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest, but since it's already taken, we allocate item 4 (next highest value) to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest, so we allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest, but since it's already taken, we allocate item 8 (next highest value) to agent 4.

Now let's allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0 also values item 0 and 1 highly, but since item 0 is taken, we give them item 1.
- Agent 1 also values item 6 highly, so we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 8 highly, but since item 8 is taken, we give them item 7.
- Agent 3 values item 2 highly, so we allocate item 2 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 has item 8, so we balance by assigning item 3 as well.

Thus, the allocations can be represented as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [0, 6],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [3, 2],
    "4": [8]
}
```
