Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  98  77  77  86  71   1   5  18
1  30  44   5  45  18  38   0  87  25
2  91  91  56  64  61  13  24  76  39
3  69  36  43  39  19   8  66  93  16
4  97  56  97  96   1  67  84  97  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values for items 1 and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value for item 7.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values for items 0 and 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value for item 6.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values for items 3, 5, and 8.

This way, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [3, 5, 8]
}
```

This allocation considers maximizing each agent's value based on their preferences while ensuring that each agent participates in the allocation process.
