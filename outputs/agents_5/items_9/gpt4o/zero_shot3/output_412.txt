Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  40  46  10  11  61  93  15  44
1  74  71  39  66  31  63  20  68  75
2  60  63  19  24  30  71  84  93  84
3  72   8   2  73  46  24  58  63  47
4  25   5  19  89  81  29   9  18  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. One common approach is to attempt to assign items in such a way that each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued item for Agent 0 is item 6 (value 93).

2. **Agent 1**: The highest-valued item for Agent 1 is item 0 (value 74), which is already taken. The next highest is item 8 (value 75).

3. **Agent 2**: The highest-valued item for Agent 2 is item 7 (value 93).

4. **Agent 3**: The highest-valued item for Agent 3 is item 3 (value 73).

5. **Agent 4**: The highest-valued item for Agent 4 is item 3 (value 89), which is already taken. The next highest is item 4 (value 81).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items in a way that tries to maximize total satisfaction:

6. **Agent 0**: The next highest-valued item after item 6 (value 93) is item 0 (value 71), which is already taken. The next highest available is item 5 (value 61).

7. **Agent 1**: The next highest-valued item after item 8 (value 75) is item 1 (value 71).

8. **Agent 3**: The next highest-valued item after item 3 (value 73) is item 7 (value 63), which is already taken. The next highest available is item 0 (value 72), which is already taken. The next highest available is item 4 (value 46).

9. **Agent 4**: The next highest-valued item after item 4 (value 81) is item 8 (value 83), which is already taken. The next highest available is item 3 (value 89), which is already taken. The next highest available is item 1 (value 5), which is already taken. The next highest available is item 2 (value 19).

Finally, we have to ensure every item is allocated exactly once. Here is a fair allocation of items given the constraints:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 5],
    "1": [8, 1],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a number of items, and all items from the list are allocated.
