Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  33  77  40  28  26  77  25  89
1  57  63  78  54  72  40  81  74  20
2  17  31  79  19  84  49  78  74  99
3  81   4  97  58  86  37  28  72   9
4  77  73  74  92  82  17  20  49  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets items in a way that maximizes their valuations while ensuring each agent gets a reasonable share. Let's start by looking at the highest valuations for each item and attempting to assign them to the respective agents.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (81).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (73).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (97).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (92).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (84).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (49).
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (81).
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (25).
9. **Item 8**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (99).

Based on this, we can assign the items as follows:

- Agent 0: [7]
- Agent 1: [6]
- Agent 2: [4, 5, 8]
- Agent 3: [0, 2]
- Agent 4: [1, 3]

This ensures that all items are allocated and each agent is included in the allocation process. Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [4, 5, 8],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```
