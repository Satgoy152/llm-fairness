Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  59  17  43  29  88  89  34  33
1  73   1  25  26  52  42  22  51  15
2  32  39  65  82  35  28  85  32  31
3  11  33  19  13  48  51   1  31  22
4  23  77  53  84  52  95  68  13  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent has a reasonable share based on their valuations. One method to achieve this is by allocating items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that all items are allocated.

Let's consider the highest valuations and assign items accordingly to maximize the fairness of the allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 and 6 highly. We can assign these items to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 0. We can assign this item to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 and 6 highly, but item 6 is already allocated, so we'll assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 does not have very high valuations compared to others, but we can consider item 4 for them.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the highest, but it's already taken, so we assign item 4 to Agent 4 as a compromise.

Continuing this process while ensuring all items are allocated, we get:

- Assign item 7 to Agent 4, as it still has a high value after higher priorities are taken.
- Finally, we assign item 1 to Agent 2 and item 2 to Agent 3.

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4, 2],
    "4": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
