Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  24  97  31  68  67  56  90  52
1  32  61  14  87  44  30  76  29  57
2  66  49  52  50  53  35  95  87  83
3  78   4  96  59  76  31  32  94  40
4  77  21  25  48  65  87  40  53  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Initial Allocation**: Start by assigning each agent the item that they value the most, but ensure no item is assigned to more than one agent.

2. **Balancing the Allocation**: Adjust the allocations to ensure every agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and the total number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on the table:

- Agent 0 values items 2 and 7 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 6 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 2 highly, but it conflicts with Agent 0's choice.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly.

Considering the above, here's a potential allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 7
- Agent 1: Items 3
- Agent 2: Items 6, 8
- Agent 3: Items 2
- Agent 4: Items 1, 4, 5

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4, 5]
}
```
