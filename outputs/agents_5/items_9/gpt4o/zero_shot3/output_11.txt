Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  32  42  70  15  76  75  15  52
1  69  44  30  54  64   2  37  86  49
2  65  54   2  52  12   2  19  71  31
3   8  48  84  67  61  61  11  66  37
4  75  84  87  69  40  71  92  12  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. A potential strategy is to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning them items they value highly, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and no item is assigned twice.

One simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since there are 5 agents and 9 items, we must ensure that each agent gets a fair share, and some agents may not get their top choices to balance the distribution.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has for any item.
2. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
3. Adjust assignments to balance the number of items each agent gets.

Following this strategy, here is a fair allocation of the items:

- Agent 0 is assigned items 5 and 6, which they value at 76 and 75, respectively.
- Agent 1 is assigned items 1 and 7, which they value at 44 and 86, respectively.
- Agent 2 is assigned items 0 and 8, which they value at 65 and 31, respectively.
- Agent 3 is assigned items 3 and 4, which they value at 67 and 61, respectively.
- Agent 4 is assigned item 2, which they value at 87.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation aims to balance the distribution of items while considering each agent's valuations.
