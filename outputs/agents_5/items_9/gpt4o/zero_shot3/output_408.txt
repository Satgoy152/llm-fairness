Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51  37  61  49  92  46  26  82  95
1   0  52  52   2  45  47  83  11  67
2  19  27  29  49   3  90  99  34  89
3  72  47  15  52  87  97  46  75  60
4  88  69  63  29  52  23  78  77  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation of their assigned items is as balanced as possible. This is a form of the fair division problem where we ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent should receive items that they value highly. From their row, items 4 (92) and 8 (95) are the highest valued.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 6 (83) the highest. 

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 5 (90) and item 6 (99) highly, but since item 6 is already allocated, item 5 (90) can be considered.

4. **Agent 3**: They value item 5 (97) highly, but since item 5 is already allocated, item 0 (72) is the next highest.

5. **Agent 4**: They can receive item 1 (69) and item 7 (77).

After this allocation, let's check if all items are distributed:

- Item 0: Agent 3
- Item 1: Agent 4
- Item 2: Unallocated
- Item 3: Unallocated
- Item 4: Agent 0
- Item 5: Agent 2
- Item 6: Agent 1
- Item 7: Agent 4
- Item 8: Agent 0

Currently, items 2 and 3 are unallocated. We can reassign some items to balance this:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (since they also value it moderately at 29).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (since they have a moderate value of 2 for it).

Thus, the final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
