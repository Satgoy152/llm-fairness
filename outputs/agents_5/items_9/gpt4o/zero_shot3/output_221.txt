Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  73  47  45  96  30  22  27  42  20
1  34  15  32  27  38  84  62  19  38
2  85  87  81  26  56  69  16   4  90
3  30  68  44   4  46  66  59  74  96
4  25  98  66  89  35  85  83  61  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation each agent receives is balanced, if possible. This means each agent should ideally receive items that collectively have similar values, maximizing fairness based on their individual valuations. 

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values item 3 (96). Allocating this item to agent 0 seems reasonable as it maximizes their valuation.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 5 (84). Assigning this item to agent 1 would be optimal for their valuation.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 8 (90). Assigning this item to agent 2 makes sense for their valuation.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 8 (96), but it's already assigned. The next best is item 7 (74). Thus, assign item 7 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent highly values item 1 (98). Allocating this item to agent 4 maximizes their valuation.

Now we need to assign the remaining items: 0, 2, 4, and 6.

6. **Agent 0**: Already has item 3. Assign item 0 (73) as it's highly valued by them and increases their total valuation.
7. **Agent 1**: Assign item 4 (38) next as it is moderately valued by them, and they need more items.
8. **Agent 2**: Assign item 2 (81) to agent 2 as it's the second highest valued item for them.
9. **Agent 3**: Assign item 6 (59) to agent 3, as it improves their total valuation balance.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, with an emphasis on maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their item valuations.
