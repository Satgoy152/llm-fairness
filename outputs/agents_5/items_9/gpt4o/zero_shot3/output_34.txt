Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  40  37  91  41  96  41  79  92
1  19  93  62  27  18  34  39  47  13
2  47  62  79  47  64  99  13  14  83
3  86  65  71  30   0  79  67  93  55
4  89   1  89  11  40  29  74  87  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one approach is to maximize the total value for each agent given the constraint that each agent must receive an integer number of items and all items must be allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign items to agents such that the total value for each agent is maximized.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. Check that all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items based on the above criteria and ensure all items are assigned:

- Agent 0: Allocated item 5 (value = 96)
- Agent 1: Allocated items 1 and 2 (values = 93, 62)
- Agent 2: Allocated items 4 and 8 (values = 64, 83)
- Agent 3: Allocated items 3 and 7 (values = 30, 93)
- Agent 4: Allocated items 0 and 6 (values = 89, 74)

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item. The sum of items allocated is 9, which matches the total number of items.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```
