Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  17  93  90  85  38  42   0   0
1  19  95  55   7  97  72  92   6  47
2  52  48  56  44  69  13  67  55  81
3  96  62  63  15  12  40  63  62  10
4  90  12   3  92  37  51  85  22  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple heuristic where we try to maximize the total value each agent receives. This can be achieved by going through the items and assigning each item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 3 values it the highest at 96.
2. Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 95.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the highest at 93.
4. Item 3: Agent 4 values it the highest at 92.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 97.
6. Item 5: Agent 1 values it the highest at 72.
7. Item 6: Agent 4 values it the highest at 85.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the highest at 0, but since it's 0, we can give it to agent 2, who values it at 55.
9. Item 8: Agent 4 values it the highest at 93.

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 6, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives an item based on maximizing their valuation.
