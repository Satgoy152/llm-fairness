Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  58  18   3  46  63  93  67  90
1  90   2  31  91  93  33  18   8   2
2  54  51   1  72   5  88  90  18  46
3   3   8  26  27  69  93   0  46  75
4  44  70  55  62  65  13  91  73  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items while also considering the valuations each agent has for the items. Since there are 9 items and 5 agents, it's a challenge to distribute the items perfectly evenly, but we can aim to distribute them as fairly as possible based on their valuations.

One possible approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no agent receives more than 2 items since there are 5 agents and 9 items. Let's try this approach:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 90).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 70).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 4 (value 55).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 91).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 93).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 93).
7. Assign item 6 to agent 0 (value 93).
8. Assign item 7 to agent 4 (value 73).
9. Assign item 8 to agent 0 (value 90).

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 8
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3, 4
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Items 1, 2, 7

Since agent 1 has been allocated 3 items, which is one more than the maximum allocation of 2, I will reassign one of agent 1's items to another agent. Let's assign item 4 to agent 3, who has the next highest valuation for that item (69).

Now, the revised allocations:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 8
- Agent 1: Items 0, 3
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 4, 5
- Agent 4: Items 1, 2, 7

This distribution ensures each agent receives a fair number of items based on their valuations. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [1, 2, 7]
}
```
