Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  38  28  64  69  28  16  84  58
1   2  58  57  66   5  35  80   2  42
2  90  63  32  90   3  60   4  64  11
3  13  63  41  73  76  93  10  24  29
4  20  33  61  11  59  17  49  56  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and the total allocation sums to exactly 9 items. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent an item they value highly, seeking to distribute the high-value items among the agents.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible, considering their valuations.
3. Distribute remaining items to maintain balance and fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 7 highly with a value of 84.
- Agent 1 values item 6 highly with a value of 80.
- Agent 2 values items 0 and 3 highly with a value of 90 each. Assign item 0.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly with a value of 93.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly with a value of 61.

After assigning each agent one item they value highly, we have distributed five items. Now, we distribute the remaining four items:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 since they also value it highly.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 0 as it has a decent value of 58.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3 as they value it with 76.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4 as they have a reasonable valuation of 33.

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has received at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [2, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives items while maximizing their valuations, and all 9 items are distributed.
