Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  51   8  80  55  83  54   2  95  61
1  18  65  71  29  66  93  16  24  75
2  20  68  45  95  82  31  77  14  13
3  85  28  31  21  90   0  34  97  13
4  90  31  71  23  53  53   3  61  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 5 agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and that the allocation reflects the agents' valuations. One common approach is to maximize the sum of valuations across all agents, ensuring fairness by considering the highest value each agent places on the items.

Given the data, let's try to allocate items to maximize fairness:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (95), Item 4 (83), Item 2 (80)
   - Assign: Item 7 (95)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (93), Item 8 (75), Item 4 (66)
   - Assign: Item 5 (93)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (95), Item 4 (82), Item 6 (77)
   - Assign: Item 3 (95)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 7 (97), Item 4 (90), Item 0 (85)
   - Assign: Item 4 (90)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (90), Item 2 (71), Item 1 (31)
   - Assign: Item 0 (90)

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Remaining items: 1, 2, 6, 8
- Remaining agents: 0, 1, 2, 3

We'll continue allocating based on the highest remaining valuations:

1. **Agent 0** has Item 2 (80) as the next highest.
   - Assign: Item 2 (80)

2. **Agent 1** has Item 8 (75) as the next highest.
   - Assign: Item 8 (75)

3. **Agent 2** has Item 6 (77) as the next highest.
   - Assign: Item 6 (77)

4. **Agent 3** has Item 1 (28) as the next highest.
   - Assign: Item 1 (28)

The allocation is now complete, and each agent has been assigned at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [3, 6],
    "3": [4, 1],
    "4": [0]
}
```
