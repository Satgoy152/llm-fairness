Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  79  95  13  38  90  72  25  65
1  73  81  92  99  83  63  51  85   1
2  31  36  86  84  96  17  19  76  32
3  57  87  47  18  89  54  58  15   9
4  41  56  40  75  42  14  66  65  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that all 9 items are allocated. We'll try to ensure that each agent receives a roughly equal total value.

Let's evaluate the options:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations on items 2, 5, 0, and 1.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuations on items 3, 2, 1, and 4.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuations on items 4, 3, 7, and 2.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuations on items 1, 4, 6, and 0.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuations on items 3, 7, 6, and 1.

Let's assign the items:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (high valuation).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (highest valuation).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4 (high valuation).

Now, distribute the remaining items:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (high valuation).
- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (second-highest valuation).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (high valuation).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3 (remaining item).

Each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [6]
}
```
