Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  78  48  45  93  60  12  12  80
1  29  94  58  49  78  59  13  89  80
2  97  19  91  34  52  99  88  29  48
3  70  41  88  82  20  12   3   9  64
4  21  18  74  96  77  59  25  57  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 94 58 49 78 59 13 89 80]
 [97 19 91 34 52 99 88 29 48]

 [21 18 74 96 77 59 25 57 26]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. A common approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuation from each agent. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (93).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (94).
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (99).
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (88).
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (96).

After assigning the highest valued items, we then assign the remaining items while ensuring fairness:

6. Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as they have the second-highest valuation (97).
7. Assign item 8 to Agent 0, as they have a high valuation (80).
8. Assign item 6 to Agent 2, as they have a high valuation (88).
9. Assign item 7 to Agent 1, as they have a high valuation (89).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [5, 0, 6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```
