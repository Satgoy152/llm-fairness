Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  58  57  71  44  29  33  68  25  88
1  24  84  48  58  15  19  89  34  78
2  50  99  43  65  11  68  59  98   4
3  86  53  55   2  10   3  57  93  13
4  50  96  36  31  28  71  64  78  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one approach to distribute the items based on their valuations:

1. Evaluate each item for all agents and assign it to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with this approach:

- Item 0: Highest value is 86 by Agent 3.
- Item 1: Highest value is 99 by Agent 2.
- Item 2: Highest value is 71 by Agent 0.
- Item 3: Highest value is 65 by Agent 2.
- Item 4: Highest value is 29 by Agent 0.
- Item 5: Highest value is 71 by Agent 4.
- Item 6: Highest value is 89 by Agent 1.
- Item 7: Highest value is 98 by Agent 2.
- Item 8: Highest value is 88 by Agent 0.

Let's ensure each agent gets an item. If an agent does not get an item, give them the next best available item.

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4, 8
- Agent 1: Item 6
- Agent 2: Items 1, 3, 7
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 5

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4, 8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [1, 3, 7],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```
