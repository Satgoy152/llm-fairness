Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  44  15  46  57  95  95  61  68  46
1  90  20  47  54  64  43  55  20  59
2  27  19  42  37  66  46  36  90  74
3   9  51  46  28  73  58  95  69   2
4  94  99  76  37  55  44  15  12   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute items such that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is as balanced as possible, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly nine.

Let's analyze the table to determine a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuations for items 4 and 5.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 7.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 6.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation for items 1 and 2.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Allocated items [4, 5] for a total valuation of 95 + 95 = 190.
- **Agent 1**: Allocated item [0] for a total valuation of 90.
- **Agent 2**: Allocated item [7] for a total valuation of 90.
- **Agent 3**: Allocated item [6] for a total valuation of 95.
- **Agent 4**: Allocated items [1, 2, 3, 8] for a total valuation of 99 + 76 + 37 + 5 = 217.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, the total number of items is exactly nine, and the valuations are fairly balanced across agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 2, 3, 8]
}
```
