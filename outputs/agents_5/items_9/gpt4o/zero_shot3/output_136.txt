Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  13  17  63  96  88  22  56  12
1  44  57  12  48  28  90   9  22  53
2  95  30  11  52  38  35  13  72  56
3  98  62  23  33  56  94  51   7  66
4  61  78  32  17  45  88  31   3  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One common approach is to use the "max-min" procedure, ensuring that the allocation is as fair as possible by maximizing the minimum value received by any agent.

To achieve this, I'll apply a simple heuristic method:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent assigns to all items.
2. Allocate items one by one to the agent who values them the most but has not yet received an item, considering the current allocations.
3. Ensure each agent gets a fair share over the iterations.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. **Initial total valuations by agent:**
   - Agent 0: 385
   - Agent 1: 363
   - Agent 2: 402
   - Agent 3: 490
   - Agent 4: 399

2. **Allocate items based on highest value preference:**

   - Item 0: Allocate to Agent 3 (value 98)
   - Item 1: Allocate to Agent 4 (value 78)
   - Item 2: Allocate to Agent 0 (value 17)
   - Item 3: Allocate to Agent 0 (value 63)
   - Item 4: Allocate to Agent 0 (value 96)
   - Item 5: Allocate to Agent 1 (value 90)
   - Item 6: Allocate to Agent 3 (value 51)
   - Item 7: Allocate to Agent 2 (value 72)
   - Item 8: Allocate to Agent 3 (value 66)

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [0, 6, 8],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item while trying to maximize the value received by each agent based on their preferences.
