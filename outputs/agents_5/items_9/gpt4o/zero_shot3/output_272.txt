Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27  16   8  21  61  30  69  84   7
1  32   0  30  24  54  35  41  24  40
2  67  93  89  21  42  11  13  66  55
3  87  29  67  37  55  85   1  64  31
4  89  90  30  42  54  58  10  25  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We also aim to maximize the total value for each agent based on their individual valuations.

Let's start by calculating a potential fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valued items are 7 (84), 6 (69), and 4 (61). Assign items 7 and 6 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valued items are 0 (32), 4 (54), and 8 (40). Assign items 4 and 8 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valued items are 1 (93), 2 (89), and 0 (67). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valued items are 0 (87), 5 (85), and 2 (67). Assign items 5 and 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valued items are 0 (89), 1 (90), and 8 (84). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now let's check the allocation to ensure all 9 items are allocated:

- **Agent 0:** Items [7, 6]
- **Agent 1:** Items [4, 8]
- **Agent 2:** Item [1]
- **Agent 3:** Items [5, 0]
- **Agent 4:** Item [2]

Total number of items allocated: 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 8. We need to reallocate one more item.

Reallocation:

- **Agent 4:** Also receives item 3.

Final allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Items [7, 6]
- **Agent 1:** Items [4, 8]
- **Agent 2:** Item [1]
- **Agent 3:** Items [5, 0]
- **Agent 4:** Items [2, 3]

Total number of items allocated: 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 9. This allocation is now complete and fair.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 0],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```
