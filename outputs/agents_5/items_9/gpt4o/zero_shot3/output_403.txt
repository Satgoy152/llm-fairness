Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  20  53  98  20  12  11  63  17
1  12  28  66  72  76  44  68  43  53
2  44  28  37  11  92  75  38  86  67
3  40   2  15  58  85  33  33  77  20
4  95  46  40  57  98  75  84  58  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we must consider the valuations and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. A common approach is to use the maximum sum of valuations or to use envy-free or equitable distribution methods. Since we don't have specific constraints on fairness beyond ensuring integer allocations, I'll attempt to balance the distribution by considering the agents' preferences.

First, let's summarize the allocation based on valuations:

1. Assign the highest-valued items to each agent if possible.
2. Ensure that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items (since there are 5 agents and 9 items, most will get 1 or 2 items).
3. The goal is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation.

Considering the table and aiming for a fair distribution:

- Agent 0 highly values item 3.
- Agent 1 most values item 4.
- Agent 2 most values item 4 (already taken), so the next highest is item 5.
- Agent 3 most values item 4 (already taken), so the next highest is item 7.
- Agent 4 most values item 4 (already taken), so the next highest is item 0.

Continuing this process for remaining items:

- Agent 0: items 3 and 2 (high values).
- Agent 1: items 4 and 6.
- Agent 2: items 5 and 8.
- Agent 3: items 7 and 1.
- Agent 4: item 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [7, 1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed fairly based on the given valuations, with each agent receiving at least one item.
