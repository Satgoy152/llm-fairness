Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  47  50  78  24  92  94  30  59
1  84  52  80  48  34  71  69  87  79
2  63  54  77  55  12   8  98  24   9
3  54  94  24   0  51  62  38  24  45
4  54  68  56  91  79  68  14  13  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction (sum of valuations) for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items with high value include 5 (92) and 6 (94).
2. Agent 1: Items with high value include 0 (84) and 7 (87).
3. Agent 2: Item with high value includes 6 (98).
4. Agent 3: Item with high value includes 1 (94).
5. Agent 4: Items with high value include 3 (91) and 4 (79).

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [5, 6]
- Agent 1: [0, 7]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [3, 4, 8]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a high-value item based on their preference, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4, 8]
}
```
