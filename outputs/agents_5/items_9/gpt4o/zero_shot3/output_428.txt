Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  94  98  76  75  50  23  33  33
1  36   8  12  71  48  42  26  42  97
2  98  68  71  63  18  50  53  52   3
3  15  16  40  46   0  72   8  97  73
4  92  70  21  99  83  22  60  92  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim for a distribution that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, as there are 5 agents and 9 items.

A possible approach is to assign items based on highest individual valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

1. Start by identifying the highest value each agent has assigned to any item, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item:
   - Agent 0 values item 2 the most (98).
   - Agent 1 values item 8 the most (97).
   - Agent 2 values item 0 the most (98).
   - Agent 3 values item 7 the most (97).
   - Agent 4 values item 3 the most (99).

2. After assigning each agent their highest-valued item, we re-allocate the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's do the allocation:

- Assign each agent their highest-valued item:
  - Agent 0 gets item 2.
  - Agent 1 gets item 8.
  - Agent 2 gets item 0.
  - Agent 3 gets item 7.
  - Agent 4 gets item 3.

This leaves items 1, 4, 5, and 6 unallocated.

3. Allocate remaining items to maximize values across agents:

- Allocate item 1 to Agent 0 (94), as this is the highest remaining value.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 3 (72), as this is the highest remaining value for Agent 3.
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 4 (60), as this is the highest remaining value for Agent 4.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 1 (48), as this is the highest remaining value for Agent 1.

Now, all items are allocated, and each agent has at least one item.

Here is the finalized allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [8, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [7, 5],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation based on the given data.
