Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  31  84  70  16  22  23  14  49
1  77  85  57  32  28   3  53  65   5
2  74  75  79  73   8  72  13  27  35
3  92  68  22  10  68  31  84  25  83
4  10  14  14  67  81  83  30  72  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. 

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 2 (84), Item 0 (77)
   - Allocation: Items [2, 0]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 1 (85), Item 2 (57) - Allocating item 2 to Agent 0 so next highest is Item 7 (65)
   - Allocation: Items [1, 7]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (72), Item 3 (73)
   - Allocation: Items [3, 5]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 0 (92), Item 8 (83) - Allocating item 0 to Agent 0, 8 is available
   - Allocation: Items [8]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (83), Item 4 (81), Item 3 (67) - Allocating item 5 to Agent 2 and item 3 to Agent 2
   - Allocation: Items [4, 6]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, all items are allocated, and the allocation respects the preference values as much as possible.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```
