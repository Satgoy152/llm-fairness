Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  16  69   6  96   2  36  76  44  44
1  46   2  45  84   6  40  12  16  38
2  39  98  96  58  66  39  59   7  16
3  71  94  22  17  29   4  83  51  70
4  98  47  63  46  31  16  68  12  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [39 98 96 58 66 39 59  7 16]

 [98 47 63 46 31 16 68 12 34]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: We will assign items that maximize the valuation for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Similarly, assign items that maximize the valuation for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Continue this for Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that maximize valuation for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Finally, allocate the remaining items to Agent 4.

Let's examine the valuations and allocate the items accordingly:

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (96) and 6 (76).
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (46) and 3 (84).
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (98) and 2 (96).
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (94) and 6 (83).
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (98) and 2 (63).

Considering these, let's allocate:

- Agent 0 gets items: 3, 6
- Agent 1 gets items: 0
- Agent 2 gets items: 1, 2
- Agent 3 gets items: 7, 8
- Agent 4 gets items: 4, 5

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
