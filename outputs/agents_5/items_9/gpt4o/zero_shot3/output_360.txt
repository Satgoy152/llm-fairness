Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  85   9  17  55  88  31  54  15  96
1   5  65  15  38  79  24  85  40  94
2  12  11  40  72  74  39  29  70   6
3  42  84   4  21   6  10  35  67  73
4  66  34  51  23  56  31   6  23  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value of items each agent receives while ensuring that all items are distributed and each agent receives a reasonable share. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most and try to ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
2. Balance the allocations so that each agent has a fair share of the total valuation, ensuring no agent is left out.

Here's how the allocation could look:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it highest (85).
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it highest (84).
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it highest (51).
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it highest (72).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it highest (88).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it highest (39).
- Item 6: Agent 1 values it highest (85).
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it highest (67).
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it highest (94).

This allocation gives priority to the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. The JSON format for this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
