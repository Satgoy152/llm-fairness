Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  20  10  82  12   9  55  78  31
1  73  99   0  80  24  89  52   9  63
2  18  29  58  70  12  91  37  54  99
3   0  57  44  94  22  23  26  98  34
4  17  30  12  61  98  42  50  95  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that considers the valuations of the agents. A common approach is to use an algorithm such as the "Maximum Weight Matching" in a bipartite graph, where agents and items form two sets, and edges between them have weights corresponding to valuations.

However, given the constraints and for simplicity, we can manually allocate based on the highest available valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Let's start by assigning the highest valued items to agents based on their individual valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 3 (82).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 1 (99).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 8 (99).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 7 (98).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 4 (98).

Now, we allocate the remaining items considering the next highest values and ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 3. Next highest is item 0 (38).
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 1. Next highest is item 5 (89).
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 8. Next highest is item 5, but it's taken, so next is item 6 (37).
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 7. Next highest is item 3, but it's taken, so next is item 1 (57).
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 4. Next highest is item 7, but it's taken, so next is item 1 (30).

We have some overlap with the initial allocation, so let's adjust slightly to ensure fairness and coverage of all items as follows:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

Now distribute the remaining items (2, 5, 6, 7):

- Agent 1 can take item 5 as it is the next highest value.
- Agent 2 can take item 2.
- Agent 0 can take item 6.
- Agent 3 can take item 7.

Based on this distribution, here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [8, 2],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated fairly based on the highest valuations available.
