Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  54  39  30  11  32  29  48  23
1  57  35  93  28  28  91  69  63  73
2  56  21  32  22  92  63  51  34  11
3  28   6  72  94  90  67  58  58  84
4  70  53   0  32  30  76   9  72  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [70 53  0 32 30 76  9 72 79]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the constraints and the valuation table provided, let's allocate the items:

1. For agent 1, they have a very high valuation of item 2 (93), so it makes sense to allocate item 2 to them.
2. Agent 3 has a high valuation of item 3 (94), so item 3 should be allocated to them.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation of item 4 (92), so item 4 should be allocated to them.
4. Agent 4 has a relatively high valuation of item 5 (76), so item 5 should be allocated to them.
5. Agent 1 also values item 6 highly (69), so item 6 should be allocated to them.
6. Agent 3 values item 8 highly (84), so item 8 should be allocated to them.
7. Remaining items (0, 1, 7) need to be allocated to agents 0 and 4.

Let's finalize the allocations:

- Agent 0 can receive items 0 and 1, as they have reasonable values for them.
- Agent 4 can receive item 7.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```
