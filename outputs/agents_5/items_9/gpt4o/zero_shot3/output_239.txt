Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  95  56  73  24  72  24  17  43
1  19  36  56  78  97  67  78  89  24
2   6  31  51  95   3  36  35  55  73
3  27  19  92  69  12  68  25   0  43
4  10  89  66   6   5  24  37   4  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value that each agent gets from the items they receive. We will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied with the allocation based on their valuations. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 1 and 3.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most, followed by item 3.
3. **Agent 2** values item 3 the most.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the most, followed by item 5.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 the most.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the value each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (95)
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (97)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (95)
- **Agent 3**: Item 2 (92) and Item 5 (68)
- **Agent 4**: Item 0 (89) and Item 8 (61)
- Remaining items 6 and 7 are less valuable to all, so they can be distributed to the agents who have fewer items.

After considering valuations and ensuring each agent gets items, here's a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [0, 8, 6, 7]
}
```

Each agent gets at least one item, and all 9 items are allocated. Adjustments can be made based on priority or other fairness criteria if desired.
