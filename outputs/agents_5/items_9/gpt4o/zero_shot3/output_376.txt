Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99   7  99  74  29   9  98  82  19
1  33  61  95   8  73  59  66  48   6
2  37   5  59  59  75  17  32  63  61
3  85  48  64  33  38  11  54  22  26
4  90  42  48  29  87  24  11  63  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where the highest value allocations are made first. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 6.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 4.
3. Agent 2 has moderate valuations, so I’ll aim to give them items that aren't as highly valued by others.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 0, but since it's already taken by Agent 0, I’ll look for the next best option.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4, but since it's already taken by Agent 1, I’ll look for the next best option.

After considering allocations and ensuring fairness, here is a proposed allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
