Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  69  87  63  80  81  77  99  21
1  51  97   7  47   4  73  48  51  49
2  87   4  40  58  71   4  66  76  48
3  67  44  84  57  93  30  86  14  77
4  51  87   5  36   9  97  71  11  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. Ideally, each agent should receive items that they value highly, but since there are 5 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more items than others.

We can start by allocating the items based on the highest valuations from each agent and then proceed to ensure that all items are allocated.

1. Agent 0 has a high value for item 7 (99).
2. Agent 1 has the highest value for item 1 (97).
3. Agent 2 has the highest value for item 0 (87).
4. Agent 3 has the highest value for item 4 (93).
5. Agent 4 has the highest value for item 5 (97).

Now let's see the remaining items and agents:

- Items left: 2, 3, 6, 8
- Agents need to be considered for remaining items: all agents

Let's allocate the remaining items:

1. For item 2, agent 0 values it at 87, which is the highest.
2. For item 3, agent 0 values it at 63, which is the highest among remaining agents.
3. For item 6, agent 3 values it at 86, which is the highest.
4. For item 8, agent 3 values it at 77, which is the highest.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 6, 8],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, considering the preferences shown in the valuation table.
