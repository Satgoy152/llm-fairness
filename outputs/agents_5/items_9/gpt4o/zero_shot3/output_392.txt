Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  75  31  19  49  55   3  59  48
1  51  20  16  14  58  29  96  86  96
2  43  68  65   3  49  18  41  73  27
3  22  34  91  32  78   7  94  57  16
4  53  24  59  28  58  30   3  66  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a roughly equal share of their perceived value. Given that there are 5 agents and 9 items, each agent should ideally receive either 1 or 2 items to ensure all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation based on the valuations provided:

1. **Agent 0**: We look for items that Agent 0 values highly. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 3, but item 1 is valued highly by multiple agents. To ensure a fair distribution, we allocate items that are still of reasonable value to Agent 0. Let's assign item 0 (31) and item 8 (48).

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has high valuations for items 6 and 8. Since item 8 is allocated to Agent 0, we allocate item 6 (96), and item 4 (58) to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 (68) and item 2 (65) highly. We'll allocate item 1 (68) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 has the highest value for item 2 (91). We allocate item 2 (91) to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 7 (66) and item 8 (67) highly, but since item 8 is allocated, we assign item 7 (66) to Agent 4.

Finally, we need to ensure all items are allocated. Items 3 and 5 are left. We can assign item 3 to Agent 3 and item 5 to Agent 4 for balance.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while trying to respect the agents' valuations as much as possible.
