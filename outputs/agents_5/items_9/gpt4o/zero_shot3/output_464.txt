Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  63  90  80  93   2  96  30  49
1  95  76   6  30  98  95   4  67  99
2  32  54  54  45  33  80  97  58  46
3  26  82  22  19   8  14  44  59  42
4  78  36  74  32  70  95  26  29  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 5 agents, each agent will ideally receive around 1 or 2 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued items: 6 (96), 4 (93), 2 (90)
   - Allocation: Item 6

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 8 (99), 4 (98), 0 (95), 5 (95)
   - Allocation: Items 8 and 0

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 6 (97), 5 (80), 1 (54), 2 (54)
   - Allocation: Item 5

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 1 (82), 7 (59), 0 (26)
   - Allocation: Item 1

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued items: 5 (95), 0 (78), 2 (74)
   - Allocation: Items 2, 3, and 4

Let's ensure that each item is allocated to exactly one agent:

- Items: 0 (Agent 1), 1 (Agent 3), 2 (Agent 4), 3 (Agent 4), 4 (Agent 4), 5 (Agent 2), 6 (Agent 0), 7 (Unallocated), 8 (Agent 1)

It seems I missed item 7, so let's re-evaluate and allocate item 7 to Agent 3, who has a relatively lower total value from their allocated items.

Updated allocations:
- Agent 0: Item 6
- Agent 1: Items 8, 0
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Items 1, 7
- Agent 4: Items 2, 3, 4

Now, here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [8, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [2, 3, 4]
}
```
