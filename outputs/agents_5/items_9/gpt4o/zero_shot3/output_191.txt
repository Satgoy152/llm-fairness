Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  72  37  19  18  35  71  19  17
1  19  68   9  54  78  16  93  15   3
2  74  34  43  23  95  74  68   9   8
3  56  53  78  29  42  69  93  90  88
4  13  23  11  58  92  70  53  71   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. **Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations**: Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Ensure fairness by balancing the number of items**: Adjust the allocation so that each agent receives a fair number of items, keeping in mind that some agents may value fewer items significantly more than others.

Here is the allocation based on the valuations provided:

- Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
- Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives a fair (or nearly fair) number of items.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0 is valued highest by agent 2.
- Item 1 is valued highest by agent 0.
- Item 2 is valued highest by agent 3.
- Item 3 is valued highest by agent 1.
- Item 4 is valued highest by agent 2.
- Item 5 is valued highest by agent 2.
- Item 6 is valued highest by agent 1.
- Item 7 is valued highest by agent 3.
- Item 8 is valued highest by agent 3.

However, we need to ensure that allocations are spread fairly across the agents. One possible fair allocation can be:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2, 7, 8],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives at least one item while trying to maximize their satisfaction based on their highest valuations.
