Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  39  10  41  82  89  73  71  17
1  34  20  22  26  92   2  38  62  30
2  68  87  94  74  70  88  98   1  51
3   3  27  48  24  60  84   1  31  35
4  89  23  43   0   5  93  15  66  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, while trying to maximize the total value received by each agent. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most, subject to each agent receiving at least one item.

Here's how we can proceed:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Repeat this process until all items are assigned.

Based on the table provided, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 89.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 87.
- Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 94.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 74.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most with a value of 92.
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 93.
- Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most with a value of 98.
- Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 66.
- Item 8: Agent 4 values it the most with a value of 55.

Now we check to ensure each agent has at least one item:

- Agent 0: 0 items
- Agent 1: 1 item (4)
- Agent 2: 4 items (1, 2, 3, 6)
- Agent 3: 0 items
- Agent 4: 4 items (0, 5, 7, 8)

Since Agent 0 and Agent 3 have no items, let's adjust some allocations to ensure fairness:

1. Reassign item 8 from Agent 4 to Agent 3.
2. Reassign item 7 from Agent 4 to Agent 0.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0: 1 item (7)
- Agent 1: 1 item (4)
- Agent 2: 4 items (1, 2, 3, 6)
- Agent 3: 1 item (8)
- Agent 4: 2 items (0, 5)

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 2, 3, 6],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```
