Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  67  58  82  88   2  57  44  25
1  90   9  66  59  82  90  33  46  87
2  81  35  47  12  79  41  77  65  69
3   5  13  94  25  46  28  31  84  36
4  21  37  40  51  75  26  53  38  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible, and exactly 9 items are distributed in total.

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 99.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 90.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the highest at 77.
   - Allocate item 6 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 94.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 values item 4 and 8 equally at 75, but item 8 is a higher preference than any other available item.
   - Allocate item 8 to agent 4.

Now that each agent has at least one item, we distribute the remaining items:

6. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 values item 4 the second highest at 88.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 0.

7. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 values item 8 the second highest, but it is already allocated. The next highest is item 0 at 90, which is taken, then item 4 at 82.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 1.

8. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2's next highest value is item 8, which is taken. Then item 4, which is also taken. Then item 7 at 65.
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 2.

9. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3's next highest value is item 7, which is taken. Then item 8, which is taken. Next is item 3 at 25.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 3.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while aiming to respect the preferences based on the given valuations.
