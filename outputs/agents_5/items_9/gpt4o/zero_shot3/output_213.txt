Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  34  63  34  53  70  13  64  37
1  20  26  62  94   6  53  92  87  64
2  68  41   9  70  53  82   9  44  67
3  13  82   2  14  24  73   5  10  59
4  43   0  29  57  56  52  16  30  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

One approach is to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each item is only assigned to one agent. Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 7]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [1, 8]
- Agent 4: [4, 6]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 8],
    "4": [4, 6]
}
```

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on the agents' valuations, with each agent getting a reasonable share of items that they value highly.
