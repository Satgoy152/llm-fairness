Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  40  27   8  23  24  98  88  33  55
1  35  68  65   4  65   9  80  32  28
2  25  14  49   7  43  29  17  92  15
3   2  13  63  16  15  31  83  87  37
4  73  96  23  18   2  91   3  22  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items with valuations that are as balanced as possible, taking into account the preferences indicated by the valuation table. Given that there are 5 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive 1 or 2 items each.

Let's try to allocate these items by considering each agent's highest-valued items and ensuring that all items are allocated:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 5 and 6.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 1 and 2.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 7.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 6 and 7, but item 6 is already given to Agent 0, so next highest is item 8.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 1 and 5, but item 1 is already given to Agent 1 and item 5 to Agent 0. So next highest is item 0.

Based on these considerations, here is a fair allocation of items:

- Agent 0: Items 5, 6
- Agent 1: Items 1, 2
- Agent 2: Item 7
- Agent 3: Item 8
- Agent 4: Items 0, 3, 4

This allocation ensures that all items are given out and tries to respect the agents' highest-valued preferences.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [0, 3, 4]
}
```
