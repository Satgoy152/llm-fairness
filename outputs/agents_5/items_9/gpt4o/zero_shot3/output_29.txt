Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  52  19  30  92  47  81  46  89  91
1  60  28  11  91  35  56  32  68  21
2  86   6  90  10  59  82  89  79  39
3  24  32  90  65  73  69  82  20  49
4  58  57  90  68  10  95  92  37  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. One approach to achieve this is to distribute the items based on the highest valuations each agent has for the items, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 86).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 19).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 90).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 92).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (value 73).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (value 95).
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (value 92).
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 89).
9. **Item 8**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 91).

Now, let's ensure that the allocation is fair in terms of distribution:

- Agent 0 receives items: 1, 3, 7, 8
- Agent 1 receives no items, so let's adjust:
- Agent 2 receives items: 0, 2
- Agent 3 receives item: 4
- Agent 4 receives items: 5, 6

Adjustments:
- Reassign item 1 from agent 0 to agent 1 to ensure agent 1 receives at least one item.

The final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7, 8],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
