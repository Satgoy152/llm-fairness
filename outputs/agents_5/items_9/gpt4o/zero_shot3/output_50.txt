Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  18  79  57   0  80  90  76  48  77
1  87  46   0  72  18   8  15  86  51
2  99   0  75  97  12   4   5  20  29
3  58  28  95  55  61  91  50  68  62
4  62  70  31  58  49   7  31  70  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given there are 5 agents and 9 items, at least one agent will receive two items.

Let's evaluate the best allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value items: 5 (90), 4 (80)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value items: 0 (87), 7 (86)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value items: 0 (99), 3 (97)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value items: 2 (95), 5 (91)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest value items: 1 (70), 7 (70)
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, each agent has one item, and we have 4 items left to allocate: 4, 6, 7, and 8. Let's allocate these to maximize valuation and ensure at least one agent gets an additional item.

- **Allocate remaining items:**
  - Item 4: Highest value by Agent 0 (80), allocate to Agent 0.
  - Item 6: Highest value by Agent 0 (76), allocate to Agent 0.
  - Item 7: Highest value by Agent 1 (86), allocate to Agent 1.
  - Item 8: Highest value by Agent 0 (77), allocate to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents and aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent.
