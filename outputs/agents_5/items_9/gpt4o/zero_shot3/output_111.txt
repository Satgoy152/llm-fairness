Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  41  48  89  74  29   9  35   0  72
1  38  23  90  42  27  60  64  68  57
2  55  42  64  99  76  74  63  56  95
3  48  60  50  96  39   5  18  52   9
4   1  14  88  45  73  95  69  64  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to distribute the items in such a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is one way to achieve this:

1. Identify the highest value each agent has for any item and try to allocate that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Repeat this process while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Below is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for items 2 and 3.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for items 4 and 5.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 6.
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for items 7 and 8.

Using this approach, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7, 8, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are distributed.
