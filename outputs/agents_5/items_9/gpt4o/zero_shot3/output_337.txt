Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  80   6  15  33  78  91  34  40  46
1  74  98   3  92  45  49  59  56  46
2  12  55  96  44  38  77  26   4  95
3  93  75  87  43  49  22  58  40  84
4  57  78  87  17  44  17  33  33  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items while considering the valuations, we can aim to distribute the items to maximize the total utility and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

First, let's analyze the highest valuations for each agent to guide our allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest (91).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (98).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (96).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (93).
- Agent 4 has equally high values for items 2 and 1 (87).

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning the highest-value items to each agent where possible.
2. Balance the remaining items by considering the next highest valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Following this approach:

- Assign item 5 to agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to agent 3.
- Assign item 3 to agent 4 (since agent 4 has no items yet and values item 3 reasonably well).

Now, we have 4 items left (4, 6, 7, 8) to allocate among the agents:

- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (next highest value after item 1 for agent 1).
- Assign item 6 to agent 3 (agent 3 values it decently high).
- Assign item 7 to agent 0 (agent 0 values it reasonably).
- Assign item 8 to agent 4 (agent 4 values it reasonably).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 6],
    "4": [3, 8]
}
```

This allocation aims to respect the highest valuations while distributing the items fairly among the agents.
