Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   2  62  58  34  77  97  42  65  97
1  20  66   1  32  55  90  52  80  60
2  88  22  77  24  32  77  22  23  75
3  93  17  30  17  92  43  56  75  76
4  21  52   7  20   2  17  48  85  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share of items based on their valuations. Given that there are 9 items and 5 agents, each agent should ideally receive around 1 to 2 items.

Let's take a closer look at the valuations to determine a fair allocation.

1. **Agent 0** values items 4 and 8 the highest (77 and 97 respectively). Let's allocate items 4 and 8 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values items 5 and 7 the highest (90 and 80 respectively). Let's allocate items 5 and 7 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values items 0 and 2 the highest (88 and 77 respectively). Let's allocate items 0 and 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values items 3 and 6 the highest (17 and 56 respectively, although 93 is the highest at 0, but it's already allocated). Let's allocate items 3 and 6 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 1 the highest (52). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, let's check the allocations. Each agent has received at least one item, and all 9 items have been allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 8],
    "1": [5, 7],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [3, 6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
