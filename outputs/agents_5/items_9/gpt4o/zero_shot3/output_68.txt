Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  99  84  85  38  11  83  36  14  68
1  33  89  15  26  25  71  32  45  76
2  19  82  57  96   7  36  90  78  61
3  42  98  73  86  95  10  36  62  96
4  98  92  60  17  43  76  23  31   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one possible approach is to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one potential allocation:

1. Assign the items with the highest valuation to each agent first.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Use the remaining items to balance the allocation.

Let's allocate:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (99) among all, so give item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (89), so give item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (90), so give item 6 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 8 the highest (96), so give item 8 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly but it's already taken, so give item 4 (43) to Agent 4.

Now we have allocated 5 items. Let's allocate the remaining 4 items:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0 (85).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (71).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2 (96).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (31).

This gives us the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 9.
