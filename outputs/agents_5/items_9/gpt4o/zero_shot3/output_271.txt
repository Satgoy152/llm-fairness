Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  91  11   1  29  87   1  65  31
1  29  64  54  91  89  42  43  76  11
2  88  84  56  41  45  56  59  41  18
3  50  32  85  86  33  34  33  63  54
4  35  48  98  80  57   6  99  33  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by assigning items based on their highest valuations. We also ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (91), Item 5 (87), Item 0 (63)
   - Allocate Item 1 and Item 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (91), Item 4 (89), Item 1 (64)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (88), Item 1 (84), Item 6 (59)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (86), Item 2 (85), Item 8 (54)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (99), Item 2 (98), Item 3 (80)
   - Allocate Item 6 to Agent 4.

Now we have already allocated 6 items, and there are 3 items left: Item 4, Item 7, and Item 8.

Let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 4: 
  - Best option is Agent 4 (57)
  
- Item 7:
  - Best option is Agent 1 (76)
  
- Item 8:
  - Best option is Agent 3 (54)

Finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 7],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2, 8],
    "4": [6, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, all 9 items are allocated, and each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly.
