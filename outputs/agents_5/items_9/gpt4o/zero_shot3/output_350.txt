Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   4  18  54  91  54  23  52  75  23
1  57  71  24  53  94  66  84  50  47
2  79  73  48  56  30  22  94  75  64
3   3  92  40  34  49  35   5  70  52
4  66  27  53  72   8  76   4  94  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are assigned. A common approach could be to allocate items one by one to the agent who values the current unallocated item the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing individual agent valuations:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 79.
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 92.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 54.
4. Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 94.
6. Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most at 76.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 94.
8. Item 7: Agent 4 values it the most at 94.
9. Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most at 64.

Now, let's ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible, adjusting the allocation as needed:

- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0, 6, 8]
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [5, 7]

The allocations are adjusted to ensure fairness, while also attempting to maximize the total value each agent receives.

Let's present the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 6, 8],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 7]
}
```
