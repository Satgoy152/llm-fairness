Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  37  98  75  39  70  65  50  58
1  67  26  22  44  27  47  46  50  20
2  71  38  18  23  47   2  20  33  50
3  33  33  40  41  21  24  86  87   0
4  24  90  30  54  80  95  91  72  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations, ensuring that all 9 items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent seems to value item 2 highly at 98. We can allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 0 at 67, which is one of their highest valuations. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 0 at 71, but it is already allocated. The next highest valued item is item 8 (50). Allocate item 8 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest-valued item for this agent is item 7 (87). Assign item 7 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent has high valuations for several items. Item 1 is valued at 90, and item 5 is valued at 95, which are the highest. Allocate items 1 and 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated items 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8. We need to allocate the remaining items (3, 4, 6).

6. **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (75) to Agent 0 since their next highest preference after item 2 is item 3.
7. **Agent 3**: Assign item 6 (86) to Agent 3, as it is their second-highest preference after item 7.
8. **Agent 4**: Finally, allocate item 4 (80) to Agent 4, which is another high-value item for them.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [7, 6],
    "4": [1, 5, 4]
}
```
