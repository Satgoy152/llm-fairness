Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  45  50  99  98  23   3  60  75  84
1  44   7  52  14  74  15  91  66  86
2  10  80  29   4  17  99  85   1  12
3  18  80  80  42   9  41   6  26  38
4  78  39  82   7  91  80  90  41  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. We will aim for a distribution where the total value of items for each agent is balanced as much as possible.

Let's analyze the valuations and distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 2 (99) and item 3 (98) highly. We'll assign these to Agent 0.
   
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 6 (91) and item 8 (86) highly. We'll assign these to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Values item 5 (99) and item 6 (85) highly. Since item 6 is already allocated, we'll assign item 5 (99) to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 (80) and item 2 (80) highly. Since item 2 is already allocated, we'll assign item 1 (80) to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Values item 4 (91) and item 6 (90) highly. Since item 6 is already allocated, we'll assign item 4 (91) to Agent 4.

Now, we need to ensure that all items are allocated and the distribution is balanced. We have allocated 6 items; we need to allocate 3 more items. Let's look at remaining high-value items and assign them to balance the distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Already has items 2 and 3. 
- **Agent 1**: Already has items 6 and 8.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 5.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 1.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 4.

Remaining items: 0, 7

- Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (value 78).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 0 (value 75).

Now we have:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2, 3, 7
- **Agent 1**: Items 6, 8
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 1
- **Agent 4**: Items 4, 0

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 7],
    "1": [6, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 0]
}
```
