Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  68   3  68  32  99  73  63  41
1  80  78  29  95  48  63  48   1  55
2   6  25  60  31   6  18   6  17  26
3  86  84  16  81  84  59  30  88  62
4  96  31  34  11   5   2  25   6  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. Let's go through the valuations and assign items accordingly.

1. **Agent 0** has notably high valuations for items 1 and 5. Let's assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3. Let's assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2. Let's assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 0 and 7. Let's assign these items to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a particularly high valuation for item 8. Let's assign item 8 to Agent 4.

After this first pass, we have assigned 7 out of 9 items. We need to allocate 2 more items. Let's assign based on the next highest valuations to ensure fairness:

6. **Agent 0** can also take item 6, which is their third highest valuation.
7. **Agent 4** can take item 4, which is their second highest valuation after item 8.

After these allocations, all 9 items are distributed among the agents. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 6],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [4, 8]
}
``` 

This allocation considers the highest possible valuations for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed.
