Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  75  29  99  11  93  34  90  35
1  26  21  43   8  46  30  36  89   0
2  50  88   8  33   2  72   8  66  76
3   3  63  47   9   8  22  88  65  85
4  38  33  31   0   4  43   5   7  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider both the valuations and the number of items each agent should receive. Since there are 9 items and 5 agents, we can't distribute the items evenly to each agent, but we can strive for an allocation that maximizes the total value across all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3, 5, and 7. Allocating these items to Agent 0 maximizes their total value.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Agent 1 values item 2 highly. We allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Agent 2 has high valuations for items 1 and 8. We allocate these items to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Agent 3 values item 6 highly. We allocate item 6 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 values item 0 highly. We allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes the agents' total valuation for the items they receive. The JSON representation of this allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5, 7],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 8],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [0]
}
```
