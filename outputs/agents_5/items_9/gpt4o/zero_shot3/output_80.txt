Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  95  58  82  11  59  46  95  69  10
1  34  57  30  40  31   9  73  33  48
2   3  52   5  78   8  83  82  56  86
3  95  57  33  21  13  10  69  14   2
4  84  12  62  55  63  89  69  15  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One possible approach is to iteratively assign the highest-valued unallocated item to an agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is 95 for items 0 and 6.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value is 73 for item 6.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value is 86 for item 8.
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value is 95 for item 0. But item 0 is already allocated.
   - Next highest value is 69 for item 6. But item 6 is already allocated.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (value 57).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value is 89 for item 5.
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2:
  - Highest valuation (82) is from Agent 0.
  - Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.

- Item 3:
  - Highest valuation (78) is from Agent 2.
  - Allocate item 3 to Agent 2.

- Item 4:
  - Highest valuation (63) is from Agent 4.
  - Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

- Item 7:
  - Highest valuation (69) is from Agent 0.
  - Allocate item 7 to Agent 0.

Now, each agent has received at least one item, and all 9 items have been allocated. Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 7],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [8, 3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5, 4]
}
```
