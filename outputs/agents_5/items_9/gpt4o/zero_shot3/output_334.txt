Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  14  23  75  18  82  41  65  74  55
1  95  30  49  97  39  79  27  55  72
2  11  26  39  20  13  48  71  78  49
3  38   6  30  53  60  44  93  74  60
4  52  86  81  45  88  37  54  95  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed. One common approach is to use a method that approximates the maximum sum of valuations for each agent. Let’s attempt to distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring a fair distribution.

Here’s the allocation based on the highest value each agent has for the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 4: Value 82
   - Item 2: Value 75

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: Value 97
   - Item 0: Value 95

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 7: Value 78
   - Item 6: Value 71

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 5: Value 44

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 1: Value 86
   - Item 8: Value 59

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a share of items, and we are using all 9 items.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 8]
}
```
