Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  21  46  24  36  60  10  54  73
1  77  44  92  24  79  26  26  52  81
2  57  24  28  61  62   6  91  70  40
3  61  41  13  94  98  19  61  58  96
4  38  76  32  35  26  93   8  62  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One potential approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item**: Look through each column (representing items) and identify which agent has the highest valuation.

2. **Assign the item to the agent with the highest valuation**: Allocate the item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items**: If two agents have the same valuation for an item, decide based on their current allocation to balance the total number of items they receive.

Let's allocate:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (77).
- **Item 1**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (76).
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (92).
- **Item 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (94).
- **Item 4**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (98).
- **Item 5**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (93).
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (91).
- **Item 7**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (70).
- **Item 8**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (96).

Now let's ensure each agent gets a fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: No items.
- **Agent 1**: Items [0, 2].
- **Agent 2**: Items [6, 7].
- **Agent 3**: Items [3, 4, 8].
- **Agent 4**: Items [1, 5].

Total items allocated: 9.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [6, 7],
    "3": [3, 4, 8],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while maintaining a balance in the number of items each agent receives.
