Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  57  58  20  88  91  32  95  18   1
1   9  44  33  31  36  21  27  31  47
2  99  59  74  94  10   1  36  59   9
3  10  37  51   9  75  86  30  30  89
4  19  63  13  98  35   2   9  90  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation of the items each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 6 the highest (95), so we will allocate item 6 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 8 the highest (47), so we will allocate item 8 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the highest (99), so we will allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 the highest (86), so we will allocate item 5 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest (98), so we will allocate item 3 to agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items, attempting to balance the agents' valuations:

6. **Agent 4** can also receive item 7 (90), which has a high valuation for agent 4.
7. **Agent 3** can receive item 4 (75), which is highly valued by agent 3.
8. **Agent 2** can receive item 2 (74) to increase their total valuation.
9. **Agent 1** can receive item 1 (44) to increase their total valuation.

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [8, 1],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [5, 4],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
