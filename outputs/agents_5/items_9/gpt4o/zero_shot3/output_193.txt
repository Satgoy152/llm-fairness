Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  77  85  13  94  13  93  43  92
1  16  57  38  99  67  11  33  49  23
2  87  71  26  96  17   7  14  22  78
3  96  66  85  66  59  88  74  46  85
4  74  39  44  80  37  53   7  65  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider trying to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. While there are many ways to approach fairness, one common method is to ensure that each agent gets items that maximize their individual valuations while distributing the items to cover all agents as evenly as possible. Here's a simple approach to allocate the items:

1. **Rank Items by Valuation for Each Agent**: For each agent, rank the items by their valuation.
2. **Allocate Items**: Distribute items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring each agent gets a fair share.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [4, 2]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 1]
- Agent 2: Items [0, 8]
- Agent 3: Items [5, 6]
- Agent 4: Item [7]

This allocation gives each agent some of their most valued items while distributing all items. Let's present this in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [7]
}
```
