Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  70  86  94  88  26  37  58  72
1  70  17  14  79  63  78  46  95  23
2  78  65  47  51  26  36  26  90  99
3  16  47  92  62  46  84   6  19  96
4  70  59  44  86  50  89  77  16   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 5 agents, we should aim for each agent to get at least one item, with some agents potentially receiving more based on their valuation preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: They highly value item 0 (97), item 3 (94), item 4 (88), and item 2 (86). To maximize value, we can allocate items 0 and 3 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: They highly value item 7 (95) and item 5 (78). We can allocate item 7 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: They highly value item 8 (99) and item 7 (90). Since item 7 is already allocated, we allocate item 8 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: They highly value item 2 (92) and item 8 (96). Since item 8 is already allocated, we allocate item 2 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: They highly value item 5 (89) and item 3 (86). We allocate item 5 to agent 4.

Now we have allocated 6 items. We need to allocate the remaining 3 items to ensure each agent has at least one item:

- For Agent 1, we can allocate item 1 (17), since it has the least impact on others' high-value items.
- For Agent 3, we can allocate item 6 (6), which has a low valuation for others.
- For Agent 4, we can allocate item 4 (50), which is still a reasonable value for them compared to others.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [7, 1],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [2, 6],
    "4": [5, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and maximizes their individual preferences based on the provided valuations.
