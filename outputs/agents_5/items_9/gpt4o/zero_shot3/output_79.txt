Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  67  26  32  20  38  34   3  71
1  69  15  40  29  31  42  28  95  33
2  25   3  16  86  45  25  51  41  40
3  96  42  89  67  88  54  51  23  82
4  73  52  54  43  96  75  29  90  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring each item is assigned to exactly one agent. Let's consider the valuations and distribute the items based on maximizing the individual agent's value for each item while making sure the distribution is balanced. 

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**:
  - Items: 0, 8
  - Total Value: 68 + 71 = 139

- **Agent 1**:
  - Items: 1, 5, 6
  - Total Value: 15 + 42 + 28 = 85

- **Agent 2**:
  - Items: 2
  - Total Value: 16

- **Agent 3**:
  - Items: 3, 7
  - Total Value: 67 + 23 = 90

- **Agent 4**:
  - Items: 4
  - Total Value: 96

Now, let's ensure this allocation is presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [1, 5, 6],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation strategy attempts to distribute the items so that each agent receives items that maximize their total value while ensuring a fair distribution of items to all agents.
