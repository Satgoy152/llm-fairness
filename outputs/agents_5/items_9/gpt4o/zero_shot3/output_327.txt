Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  13  39  64  55  58  59  64  37
1  90  10  23  55  17  52  46   0  35
2  50  82  76  47  89  34  50   9  53
3  53  32  54  89  86  27  37  90  69
4  19  75   4   3  67  96  97  93  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives. The objective is to ensure that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences, while all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. Calculate the maximum valuation each agent has for individual items.
2. Assign the items to the agents based on who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Ensure all 9 items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 7.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 0.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 4.
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 8 and a high valuation for item 7.
- Agent 4 has high valuations for items 5 and 6.

Considering these preferences, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 2 (64, 39)
- Agent 1: Item 0 (90)
- Agent 2: Items 4 (89)
- Agent 3: Items 8, 7 (69, 90)
- Agent 4: Items 5, 6, 1 (96, 97, 75)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items valued highly by them and that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [8, 7],
    "4": [5, 6, 1]
}
```
