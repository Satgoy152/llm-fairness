Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  76  53  74  91  84  52   8  80
1  58  79  77   8  20  85  33  36  17
2  58  63  15   0   4  33  72  59  17
3  40   4  52  57  32  89  59  17  14
4  13  77  11  33  42  29  50  29  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives from the items they are allocated. One way to achieve this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 69.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 76.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 77.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 74.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most at 89.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it the most at 72.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 2 values it the most at 59.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 0 values it the most at 80.

To ensure each agent gets at least one item, let's adjust the allocations:

- Assign Item 7 to Agent 3 instead of Agent 2 to ensure Agent 3 has at least one item.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 1 instead of Agent 0 to ensure Agent 1 is allocated at least one item.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 4 instead of Agent 0 to ensure Agent 4 receives at least one item.

Now, the allocations are:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [3, 2]
- Agent 2: Items [6]
- Agent 3: Items [5, 7]
- Agent 4: Items [4]

This allocation distributes all 9 items and ensures each agent receives at least one item.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 8],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```
