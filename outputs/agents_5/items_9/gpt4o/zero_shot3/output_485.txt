Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  34  51  54   0  69  39  73  95  60
1  81  90  24  18  60   5  75  15  17
2  75  52  93  40  91   3   6  77  88
3  67   4  47   2   2  86  66  22  25
4  43   1  16  85  92  12  49  86   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items based on their valuations while also distributing all 9 items. The goal is to maximize the total valuation of each agent's allocation, keeping the distribution as equitable as possible based on their preferences.

Let's consider the valuations for each agent and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuations: 6 (73), 7 (95), 4 (69)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - High valuations: 1 (90), 0 (81), 6 (75)
   
3. **Agent 2**:
   - High valuations: 2 (93), 4 (91), 8 (88)
   
4. **Agent 3**:
   - High valuations: 5 (86), 0 (67)
   
5. **Agent 4**:
   - High valuations: 4 (92), 3 (85), 7 (86)
   
Let's allocate the items based on these high valuations while ensuring no item is allocated to more than one agent:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 7
- Agent 1: Items 1, 0
- Agent 2: Items 2, 8
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 4, 3

Each agent gets the items they value highly, and all 9 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 3]
}
```
