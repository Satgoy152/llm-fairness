Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71   0  48  99  64  76   5  99  17
1  77  80  18  16  69  57  74  67  54
2  50  96  87  38  64  78  11  38  84
3  64  48  39   3   8  46   3  39  69
4   8  35  94  94  10   7  41  46  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We can aim to maximize the satisfaction based on the given valuations, trying to ensure that each agent gets items they value relatively highly.

Let's analyze the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - High valuations for items 0, 3, and 7.
   - Allocate items 0 and 7 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:**
   - High valuations for items 0, 1, and 6.
   - Item 0 is already allocated, so allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:**
   - High valuations for items 1, 2, and 5.
   - Item 1 is already allocated, so allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:**
   - High valuations for items 0, 1, and 8.
   - Items 0 and 1 are already allocated, so allocate item 8 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:**
   - High valuations for items 2, 3, and 4.
   - Items 2 and 3 are already allocated, so allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Item 3:** Not yet allocated and highly valued by Agent 0.
- **Item 5:** Not yet allocated and highly valued by Agent 2.
- **Item 6:** Not yet allocated and valued by Agent 1.

Allocate:
- Item 3 to Agent 4 (since Agent 4 also values it highly).
- Item 5 to Agent 2.
- Item 6 to Agent 1.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items [0, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 3: Items [8]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 4]

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7],
    "1": [1, 6],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [8],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
