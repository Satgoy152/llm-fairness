Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  96  89  65  70  54  48  82  84
1  24  50   9  89  21  51  50  31  10
2  82   6  11   3  41  43  15  67  82
3  84  15   5  98  48  91  27  41  30
4  53  51  42   0  50  57   1  47  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent. We'll try to allocate items such that each agent gets items they value highly, while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 has high values for items 0, 1, and 2. We can allocate items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 highly. We can allocate item 3 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 8. We can allocate item 8 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 5 highly. We can allocate item 5 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has a relatively high value for item 4. We can allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- For item 2, Agent 0 has the highest valuation. Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- For item 6, Agent 1 and Agent 3 have relatively moderate values, but since Agent 3 has fewer items, allocate item 6 to Agent 3.
- For item 7, Agent 2 has a high value. Allocate item 7 to Agent 2.

Now, each item is allocated, and each agent has at least one item except Agent 1, who has a high-value single item. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [8, 7],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations.
