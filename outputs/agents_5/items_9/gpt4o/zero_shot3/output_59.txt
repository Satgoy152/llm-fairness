Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  99  75  34  59  56  86  63  55
1  27  99  11  41  63  64  72  74  14
2  10  87  40  63  85   1  26  39  21
3  35  18  43  68  34  67  38  90  90
4  93  81  57  54  33  93  66  29  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 5 agents, we should aim to maximize the total value for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation strategy that balances these considerations:

1. **Calculate the total value for each agent if they were to receive each item.**
2. **Prioritize allocations based on the highest valuation by each agent.**
3. **Ensure no agent receives more than three items, as they should be distributed among the five agents.**
4. **Adjust the allocations to ensure all items are distributed while aiming to maximize each agent's total value.**

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 6 (highest values for these items)
- Agent 1: Items 1, 7 (highest values for these items)
- Agent 2: Items 4, 3 (high value, and remaining available)
- Agent 3: Items 8, 5 (high value, and remaining available)
- Agent 4: Item 2 (remaining available)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets around two items and that all items are distributed among the agents.

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 7],
    "2": [4, 3],
    "3": [8, 5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This approach aims to provide a fair distribution of items taking into consideration the agents' valuations and ensuring all items are allocated.
