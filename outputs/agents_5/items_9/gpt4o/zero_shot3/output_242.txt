Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  84  98  55  20  11  91   2  19
1  68  78  34  27   8  85  56  24  18
2   4  69  52  55  27  69  63  83  12
3  75  40   9  72  92  69  45   0  57
4  55  89  28  90  43  93  15  26  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 5 agents, I will consider that each agent should receive an approximately equal sum of valuations to ensure fairness. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** 
   - Look for the highest valuations for each item and prioritize assigning those items to corresponding agents for whom the valuation is highest.

2. **Balance Total Allocation:**
   - Ensure that the total value each agent receives is balanced with respect to other agents as closely as possible. This might not be perfectly equal due to rounding constraints, but the goal is to minimize disparity.

3. **Ensure Each Agent Gets Items:**
   - Each agent should be assigned at least one item until all items are distributed.

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0:** Will receive items [2, 6] with valuations 98 and 91 respectively.
- **Agent 1:** Will receive items [0, 5] with valuations 68 and 85 respectively.
- **Agent 2:** Will receive items [7, 3] with valuations 83 and 55 respectively.
- **Agent 3:** Will receive items [4, 8] with valuations 92 and 57 respectively.
- **Agent 4:** Will receive item [1] with valuation 89.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and attempts to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Here is the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [7, 3],
    "3": [4, 8],
    "4": [1]
}
```
