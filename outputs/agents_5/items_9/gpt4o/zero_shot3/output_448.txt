Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  79  99  14  78   9  97  73  94
1  14   3   0  44  58  87  94  44  34
2  16  64  59  31  22  63  92  40  74
3  73  22  84  38  78   6  44  90  22
4  11  38   6  97  97  76  16   5  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, while ensuring all items are distributed.

We have 5 agents and 9 items. Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 2, 6, and 8.
2. **Agent 1** highly values items 5 and 6.
3. **Agent 2** highly values items 6, 8, and 1.
4. **Agent 3** highly values items 0, 2, and 7.
5. **Agent 4** highly values items 3 and 4.

Considering these preferences, a fair allocation can be:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items [2, 8]
  - These are among the highest-valued items for Agent 0.

- **Agent 1**: Assign items [5]
  - Item 5 is valued highly by Agent 1.

- **Agent 2**: Assign items [1]
  - Item 1 is valued highly by Agent 2.

- **Agent 3**: Assign items [0, 7]
  - These are among the highest-valued items for Agent 3.

- **Agent 4**: Assign items [3, 4, 6]
  - These items are among the highest-valued items for Agent 4, especially item 6, which is also valued by others.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 8],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [3, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, considering their preferences as much as possible.
