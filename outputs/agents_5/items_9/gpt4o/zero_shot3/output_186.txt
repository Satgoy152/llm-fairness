Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  54   2   3  32  23  70  48  87  34
1   3  43  46  92   6  93  15   0  98
2  71  69  17  67  46  11   8  64  51
3  30  15  49  99  79  34  30   7   3
4  16  41   5  56  71  25  90  62  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic: assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who places the highest value on it, which can be considered a fair allocation in terms of maximizing individual valuations.

Let's go through the items and allocate them accordingly:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is 71 by Agent 2. So, allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is 69 by Agent 2. So, allocate Item 1 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 49 by Agent 3. So, allocate Item 2 to Agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 99 by Agent 3. So, allocate Item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 79 by Agent 3. So, allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is 93 by Agent 1. So, allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.
7. **Item 6**: The highest valuation is 90 by Agent 4. So, allocate Item 6 to Agent 4.
8. **Item 7**: The highest valuation is 87 by Agent 0. So, allocate Item 7 to Agent 0.
9. **Item 8**: The highest valuation is 98 by Agent 1. So, allocate Item 8 to Agent 1.

Now, let's compile the allocations into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [7],
    "1": [5, 8],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2, 3, 4],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the total valuation for each item by assigning it to the agent who values it the most.
