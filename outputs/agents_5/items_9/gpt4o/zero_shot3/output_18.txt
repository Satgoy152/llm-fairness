Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21   9   7   0   1   7  74  53  98
1   7   0  15  86  77  10  17  86  97
2  67  94  31  86  32  31  49  37  96
3  52  96  79  68  82  93  57   2  53
4  83   8  10  82  18  32  27  60   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we aim to distribute the items based on the agents' valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify High Valuations:** Look for items with high valuations by specific agents to ensure they receive items they value highly.
   
2. **Distribute Items:** Ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible, and distribute based on maximizing overall satisfaction.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Values item 8 the highest at 98.
- **Agent 1:** Values item 7 the highest at 86.
- **Agent 2:** Values item 1 the highest at 94.
- **Agent 3:** Values item 5 the highest at 93.
- **Agent 4:** Values item 0 the highest at 83.

With these initial high valuations, we can allocate as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 8
- Agent 1: Item 7
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 0

This covers 5 items. Now, distribute the remaining 4 items:

- **Remaining Items:** 2, 3, 4, 6
- **Agent 3:** Also has high valuations for item 3 (68) and item 4 (82).
- **Agent 2:** Also has a high valuation for item 6 (49).
- **Agent 0:** Can take item 2 as it values it at 7 which is higher than other items left.

Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [8, 2]
- Agent 1: [7]
- Agent 2: [1, 6]
- Agent 3: [5, 3, 4]
- Agent 4: [0]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and agents receive items they value relatively highly.

Here is the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 2],
    "1": [7],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [5, 3, 4],
    "4": [0]
}
```
