Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  19  53  49  80  67   3  82  46  92
1  87  26  83  72  91  99  46  51  46
2  22  40  83  23  60  47   1  17  17
3  64  22  56  90  37  50   7  75  76
4  16  12  86  68  96  36  99  87  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. The goal is to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the items, taking into consideration their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 8 the most (value of 92). After considering other items, assigning item 8 to Agent 0 maximizes their satisfaction.

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 5 (value of 99). Allocating item 5 to Agent 1 will maximize their satisfaction.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 2 the most (value of 83). Assigning item 2 to Agent 2 will maximize their satisfaction.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 3 the most (value of 90). Allocating item 3 to Agent 3 will maximize their satisfaction.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 6 the most (value of 99). Assigning item 6 to Agent 4 will maximize their satisfaction.

Now, we have allocated the highest valued items to each agent. The remaining items are 0, 1, 4, and 7. We will distribute these remaining items based on the next highest preferences:

6. **Agent 0**: The next highest valued item is item 4 (value of 67).

7. **Agent 3**: The next highest valued item is item 7 (value of 75).

8. **Agent 1**: The next highest valued item is item 0 (value of 87).

9. **Agent 2**: The next highest valued item is item 1 (value of 40).

This allocation attempts to fairly distribute the items based on each agent's preferences while ensuring every item is allocated exactly once.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4],
    "1": [5, 0],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```
