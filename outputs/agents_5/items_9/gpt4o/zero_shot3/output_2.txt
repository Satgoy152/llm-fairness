Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  24  72  97  21  74  34  34  10  68
1  22  35  84  24  91  68  11  68  93
2  37  98  61  41  21  33  77  97  79
3   5  84  62  86  59  73  64  37  25
4  69  40  37  22  53  95  85  63  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a reasonable distribution based on their valuations while ensuring all 9 items are allocated. We can use a simple method to allocate items by giving each agent their highest-valued item one by one until all items are assigned. This is a heuristic approach that tries to provide a fair allocation based on the given valuations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Find the highest-valued item for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Item 2 with value 97
   - Agent 1: Item 8 with value 93
   - Agent 2: Item 1 with value 98
   - Agent 3: Item 3 with value 86
   - Agent 4: Item 5 with value 95

2. **Allocate these items first** to ensure that each agent gets an item they highly value, if possible:
   - Agent 0 gets Item 2
   - Agent 1 gets Item 8
   - Agent 2 gets Item 1
   - Agent 3 gets Item 3
   - Agent 4 gets Item 5

3. **Allocate the remaining items:**
   - Remaining items are 0, 4, 6, 7.
   - To balance the allocation, distribute the remaining items based on next highest valuations or to agents who have fewer items.

4. **Final allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Already has Item 2, allocate next highest value item 0.
   - Agent 1: Already has Item 8, allocate next highest value item 4.
   - Agent 2: Already has Item 1, allocate next highest value item 6.
   - Agent 3: Already has Item 3, allocate next highest value item 7.
   - Agent 4: Already has Item 5, no more items available for allocation.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [8, 4],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items, and all items are allocated according to their valuations as fairly as possible.
