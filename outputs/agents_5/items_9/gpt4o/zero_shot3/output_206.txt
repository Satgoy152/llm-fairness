Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   1  50  91  81  98  49  74  42  48
1  35  28  10  24  98  94  35  25  55
2  23  47  86  55  54  21  81  17  43
3  46  45  25  88  78  31  74  58  69
4  13  92  76  15  59   8  32  72  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives a reasonable share. Since there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others.

One strategy is to maximize each agent's total valuation by allocating items they value highly, while ensuring every item is allocated. Let's proceed with a manual allocation based on the table provided:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: 98 (Item 4), 91 (Item 2)
   - Allocate Items: 4, 2

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: 98 (Item 4), 94 (Item 5), 55 (Item 8)
   - Allocate Items: 5, 8

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: 86 (Item 2), 81 (Item 6)
   - Allocate Items: 6

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: 88 (Item 3), 78 (Item 4), 69 (Item 8)
   - Allocate Items: 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: 92 (Item 1), 76 (Item 2), 72 (Item 7)
   - Allocate Items: 1, 7

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share, considering some items might need to be reallocated to balance:

- Allocate Item 0 to Agent 0 (lowest value, but ensures Agent 0 gets more than one item)
- Reallocate Item 4 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 values it highly and Agent 0 already has two items)

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5, 8
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Items 1, 7

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 5, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```
