Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  46   1  45  20  55  11  42   5
1  13  56  33  17  75   6  24  68  90
2  89  41  49   6  62  39  97  49  78
3  24  42  59  38  59  47  79  13  91
4  90  83  13  26  83   5   2  96  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated exactly once. Given the valuations, one approach is to assign items based on the highest value an agent places on them, while also ensuring a relatively balanced distribution of items among the agents.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it highest at 90.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it highest at 83.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it highest at 59.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it highest at 45.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it highest at 75.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it highest at 55.
7. **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it highest at 97.
8. **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it highest at 96.
9. **Item 8**: Agent 1 values it highest at 90.

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5
- Agent 1: Items 4, 8
- Agent 2: Item 6
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Items 0, 1, 7

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 1, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
