Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  36  12  67  73  72  33  62  26  69
1  19  74  42  92  10  50  84  86  17
2  15  39  49  68  32   1   5  75  69
3  29  79  69  86  25  94  65   0  33
4  63  28  36  26  48  21   7  57  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring all items are distributed. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the highest valuation each agent has for any item and assign that item to the agent.
2. For remaining items, assign them to the agents who have the next highest valuation for those items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Letâ€™s implement this approach:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (73).
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (92), but it is already taken, so we assign item 7 (86) to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 7 the highest (75), but it is already taken, so we assign item 3 (68) to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (94).
5. Agent 4 values item 8 the highest (98).

Now, allocate remaining items:

- Assign item 2 (67) to agent 0, who has the second highest value for it.
- Assign item 0 (19) to agent 1, who has the highest remaining value for it.
- Assign item 1 (39) to agent 2, who has the highest remaining value for it.
- Assign item 4 (48) to agent 4, who has the highest remaining value for it.
- Assign item 6 (62) to agent 0, who has the highest remaining value for it.

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3, 6],
    "1": [0, 7],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated to an agent, and all agents have received at least one item with the exception of agent 3 who has received only one item as per their highest preference and availability.
