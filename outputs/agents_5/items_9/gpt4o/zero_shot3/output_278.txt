Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  22  95  52  12  73  33  76  15
1   7  30  75  78  55  38  13  65  95
2  72  25  70   5  13  95  90  45  57
3  38  13  76  92  43  92  46  47  36
4  59  84  40  98  76  46  36   0  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We'll use a simple greedy approach to allocate items to the agents with the highest valuation for each item, making adjustments if necessary to ensure each agent receives at least one item. 

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 72.
2. Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most at 84.
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
4. Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most at 98.
5. Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most at 76.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 95.
7. Item 6: Agent 2 values it the most at 90.
8. Item 7: Agent 0 values it the most at 76.
9. Item 8: Agent 1 values it the most at 95.

Now let's ensure each agent receives at least one item:

- Agent 0: Already has items 2, 7.
- Agent 1: Already has item 8.
- Agent 2: Already has items 0, 5, 6.
- Agent 3: Has no items, so we need to reallocate one item to this agent. Let's give item 3 to agent 3 instead of agent 4, as agent 4 has multiple items.
- Agent 4: Has items 1, 3 (reallocated), 4.

Adjusted Allocations:

1. Agent 0: [2, 7]
2. Agent 1: [8]
3. Agent 2: [0, 5, 6]
4. Agent 3: [3]
5. Agent 4: [1, 4]

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [0, 5, 6],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
