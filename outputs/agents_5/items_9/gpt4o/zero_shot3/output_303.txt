Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  47  76  90  89  82  78  46  47   2
1  67  10  20  79   2  95   8  76  21
2  52  82  27  82  26  32  81  70  76
3  70  17  74  89  63  80  65  29  35
4  89  85  18  91  88  80  37  12  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the valuations given by each agent. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we might approach this:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by identifying which items are most valued by each agent.

2. **Initial Allocations:** Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that no item is allocated to more than one agent.

3. **Adjust for Fairness:** If some agents have significantly more items or higher total valuation than others, adjust the allocation to improve fairness.

4. **Finalize Allocations:** Make sure all items are allocated, and each agent has an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 90, so assign item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 95, so assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 82, so assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 89, so assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest at 88, so assign item 4 to agent 4.

After the initial allocation, the remaining items are 0, 6, 7, and 8.

- Re-evaluate remaining unallocated items:
  - Agent 0 also values item 0 at 47, which is the highest among the remaining items for agent 0. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
  - Agent 2 values item 6 at 81, which is the highest among the remaining items for agent 2. Assign item 6 to agent 2.
  - Agent 3 values item 8 at 35, which is the highest among the remaining items for agent 3. Assign item 8 to agent 3.
  - Agent 4 values item 7 at 12, which is the highest among the remaining items for agent 4. Assign item 7 to agent 4.

Now all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
