Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  60  46  72   3  19   7  15  30  86
1  46   5   5  34  42  22  40  30  82
2  12  99  53   5  83  70  32  19   1
3  93  17  36  10  29  60  60  62   4
4  28  49  99   1  53  32  15  61  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations, we can approach this problem by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that the distribution is fair. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning the items to the agent who values them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets a fair share of items, considering the total number of items and agents.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (93). Assign to Agent 3.
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (99). Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (99). Assign to Agent 4.
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (34). Assign to Agent 1.
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (83). Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (70). Assign to Agent 2.
- Item 6: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (60). Assign to Agent 3.
- Item 7: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (62). Assign to Agent 3.
- Item 8: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (86). Assign to Agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4, 5],
    "3": [0, 6, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```
