Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  27   4  87  12  94  21  16  49  36
1  17  86  11   1  97  54  38  68  60
2  31  68  55  66  23   0  83  39   9
3  89  49  75  12  62  17  75  71  13
4  82  99  95  91   5  96  36  74  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives a roughly equal share of their perceived value, given the constraints that each agent must receive an integer number of items and that all items must be allocated.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Try to distribute items in such a way that each agent receives items which maximize their own valuation.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated.

Let's compute this step by step:

### Step 1: Total Valuation of Each Agent
- Agent 0: 27 + 4 + 87 + 12 + 94 + 21 + 16 + 49 + 36 = 346
- Agent 1: 17 + 86 + 11 + 1 + 97 + 54 + 38 + 68 + 60 = 432
- Agent 2: 31 + 68 + 55 + 66 + 23 + 0 + 83 + 39 + 9 = 374
- Agent 3: 89 + 49 + 75 + 12 + 62 + 17 + 75 + 71 + 13 = 463
- Agent 4: 82 + 99 + 95 + 91 + 5 + 96 + 36 + 74 + 72 = 650

### Step 2: Initial Allocation
- Prioritize high-value items for each agent based on their valuations.

### Step 3: Finalize Allocation
- Ensure each item is only given to one agent, and that all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Items 1, 5
- Agent 2: Items 6, 3
- Agent 3: Items 0, 7
- Agent 4: Items 8

This allocation attempts to give each agent high-value items according to their preferences while ensuring all items are allocated.

### JSON Representation:
```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [6, 3],
    "3": [0, 7],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents in a way that considers their respective valuations.
