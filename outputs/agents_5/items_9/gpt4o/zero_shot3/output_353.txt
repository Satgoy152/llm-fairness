Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  76   4  97  97  96  79  58  75   2
1  44  41  93  81  99  28  70  96  78
2  95  79  90  15  35  91  67  34  59
3  39  87  53   8   2  17  81  92  48
4  65  59  94  32  20   6  31  77  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given the valuations, we can use a simple greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that the distribution of items is balanced among agents. Here is one potential allocation:

1. **Assign the highest valued items first:**
   - Item 0: Agent 2 (value 95)
   - Item 1: Agent 3 (value 87)
   - Item 2: Agent 0 (value 97)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (value 97)
   - Item 4: Agent 1 (value 99)
   - Item 5: Agent 2 (value 91)
   - Item 6: Agent 3 (value 81)
   - Item 7: Agent 1 (value 96)
   - Item 8: Agent 2 (value 59)

2. **Ensure each agent receives at least one item:**
   - Agent 4 hasn't received any item yet, so we need to adjust allocations to ensure all agents receive at least one item. We can reallocate one item from an agent with multiple items to Agent 4.
   - Move Item 8 from Agent 2 to Agent 4.

3. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: [2, 3]
   - Agent 1: [4, 7]
   - Agent 2: [0, 5]
   - Agent 3: [1, 6]
   - Agent 4: [8]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 6],
    "4": [8]
}
```
