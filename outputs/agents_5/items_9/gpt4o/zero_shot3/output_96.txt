Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  80  17   3  62  94  22  32  24
1  99  76   2  43  32  43   8  18  37
2  84  30  89  71  63  65  38  24  47
3  59  38  62  67  90  59  57  21  45
4  90  30  63  49  37  32  86  11  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations for Agent 0 are for items 5 (value 94) and 1 (value 80). Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is for item 0 (value 99). Assign this item to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is for item 2 (value 89). Assign this item to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is for item 4 (value 90). Assign this item to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is for item 6 (value 86). Assign this item to Agent 4.

After assigning these items based on highest individual valuations, we continue allocating the remaining items to balance the distribution:

6. **Remaining items**: Items 3, 7, and 8 remain unallocated. We can distribute these to agents with fewer items or lower total valuations.

   - Assign item 3 to Agent 3, who has a valuation of 67 for it.
   - Assign item 7 to Agent 0, who has a valuation of 32 for it.
   - Assign item 8 to Agent 2, who has a valuation of 47 for it.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5, 7],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 8],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item based on their highest valuations.
