Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  28  17  13  68  41  16  91  21  79
1  69  42   7  16  49  36   1  47  45
2  72  76  27  85  77  15  24  24  56
3  73  73   6  97  60  48  18  71  77
4  71  21  40   5   9  42  86  62  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations given by each agent for the items. A commonly used method for fair allocation is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their perceived value while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The items with the highest valuations for Agent 0 are 6, 8, and 3.
2. **Agent 1**: The items with the highest valuations for Agent 1 are 0, 4, and 7.
3. **Agent 2**: The items with the highest valuations for Agent 2 are 3, 1, and 4.
4. **Agent 3**: The items with the highest valuations for Agent 3 are 3, 0, and 8.
5. **Agent 4**: The items with the highest valuations for Agent 4 are 6, 0, and 8.

Since item 3 is highly valued by Agents 2 and 3, we will allocate it to Agent 3 because it has the highest value for Agent 3. Item 6 is highly valued by Agents 0 and 4, so we allocate it to Agent 0. Item 0 is highly valued by Agents 1, 3, and 4, but fits best with Agent 1's distribution. Let's allocate the remaining items based on this information:

- **Agent 0**: Allocating items 6 and 8.
- **Agent 1**: Allocating items 0 and 4.
- **Agent 2**: Allocating item 1 and 5.
- **Agent 3**: Allocating items 3 and 7.
- **Agent 4**: Allocating item 2.

Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [2]
}
```
