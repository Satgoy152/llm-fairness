Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  90   0  85  49  97  99  11  37  85
1  39  39  23  46  48  97  60  89  94
2  78  75  52  88  82  84  84   5  44
3  75  28  53  23  37  43  99  75  40
4  34  73   7  70  28  73  66  36  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual valuations while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Here is one way to proceed:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation Per Item**: For each item, identify which agent values it the highest and allocate the item to that agent, if possible.
2. **Ensure Fair Distribution**: Since there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will naturally receive more items than others. We will attempt to balance the allocation so that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and no agent receives an excessive number of items.

Let's proceed with these steps:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it highest at 90.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it highest at 73.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it highest at 85.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it highest at 88.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it highest at 97.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it highest at 99.
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it highest at 99.
- Item 7: Agent 1 values it highest at 89.
- Item 8: Agent 1 values it highest at 94.

Now, distribute the items according to these preferences while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, where possible:

- Agent 0 already has items 0, 2, 4, and 5.
- Agent 1 gets items 7 and 8.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 6.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.

The allocation satisfies the conditions as follows:

- Agent 0: [0, 2, 4, 5]
- Agent 1: [7, 8]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [6]
- Agent 4: [1]

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1]
}
```
