Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  23  61   9  21  14  53  70  41  73
1  11  91   3  26  77  42  71   8  80
2  70  64  58   4  77  48  46  45  76
3  96  41  61  30  53  87  41  14  25
4  54  77  62  18  93   9  71  81  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We will use a method that attempts to balance the distribution of high-value items among the agents.

Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 3 (96). Allocate it to Agent 3.
2. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 1 (91). Allocate it to Agent 1.
3. **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 3 (61). Allocate it to Agent 3.
4. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 1 (26). Allocate it to Agent 1.
5. **Item 4** has the highest value for Agent 4 (93). Allocate it to Agent 4.
6. **Item 5** has the highest value for Agent 3 (87). Allocate it to Agent 3.
7. **Item 6** has the highest value for Agent 0 (70). Allocate it to Agent 0.
8. **Item 7** has the highest value for Agent 4 (81). Allocate it to Agent 4.
9. **Item 8** has the highest value for Agent 0 (73). Allocate it to Agent 0.

Now, let's check if each agent receives at least one item and if all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items [0, 2, 5]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 7]

Agent 2 did not receive any items, so we need to adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item. Let's review the distribution again:

1. **Item 0** (96) stays with Agent 3.
2. **Item 1** (91) stays with Agent 1.
3. **Item 2** (58) can go to Agent 2 instead of Agent 3.
4. **Item 3** (26) stays with Agent 1.
5. **Item 4** (93) stays with Agent 4.
6. **Item 5** (48) can go to Agent 2 instead of Agent 3.
7. **Item 6** (70) stays with Agent 0.
8. **Item 7** (81) stays with Agent 4.
9. **Item 8** (73) stays with Agent 0.

Revised allocation:

- Agent 0: Items [6, 8]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 3]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 3: Item [0]
- Agent 4: Items [4, 7]

Now, each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the JSON format of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```
