Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  18  17  24   6  22  17  16  51
1  34   0  40  65  94  66  99  27  20
2  42  22  27  73  80  67  43  19  73
3  14   3  72  64  29  46  71  31  24
4  61   0  66   7  38  84  86  72  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives items that maximize their satisfaction. Let's proceed by assigning items based on the highest value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Items [0, 8]
   - Valuation: 66 (Item 0) + 51 (Item 8) = 117

2. Agent 1: Items [6]
   - Valuation: 99 (Item 6) = 99

3. Agent 2: Items [3, 4]
   - Valuation: 73 (Item 3) + 80 (Item 4) = 153

4. Agent 3: Items [2]
   - Valuation: 72 (Item 2) = 72

5. Agent 4: Items [5, 7, 1]
   - Valuation: 84 (Item 5) + 72 (Item 7) + 0 (Item 1) = 156

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5, 7, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
