Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  31  53  24  94  45  95  68  85  80
1  78  65  42  67  59  88  81  19  55
2  19  10  43  21  14  41  56  30  13
3  45  60   9   4  13  27  67  16  92
4  96  50  26  17  59  72  60  29  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will try to distribute the items based on maximizing the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. 

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. Agent 0: We look for the highest remaining values for Agent 0. The highest values are for items 5 (95) and 3 (94). We'll allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

2. Agent 1: The highest values for Agent 1 are for items 0 (78) and 6 (81). We'll allocate item 6 to Agent 1.

3. Agent 2: For Agent 2, the highest remaining values are for items 2 (43) and 6 (56). We'll allocate item 2 to Agent 2.

4. Agent 3: The highest values for Agent 3 are for items 8 (92) and 1 (60). We'll allocate item 8 to Agent 3.

5. Agent 4: The highest values for Agent 4 are for items 0 (96) and 5 (72). We'll allocate item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 already has item 5.
- Agent 1 already has item 6.
- Agent 2 already has item 2.
- Agent 3 already has item 8.
- Agent 4 already has item 0.

For the remaining items 1, 3, 4, and 7, we will distribute them to balance the allocation:

- Allocate item 3 to Agent 1 (next highest value for Agent 1).
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 3 (next highest value for Agent 3).
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 4 (next highest value for Agent 4).
- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 7],
    "1": [6, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [8, 1],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.
