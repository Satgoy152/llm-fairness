Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35   9  54  95  48  94  69  69  78
1  91  38  61  35  12  77  82  14  93
2  67  19  76  21  39  19  85  11  56
3  13  87  59  16  52  38  92  10  23
4  92  22  27  68  24  25  12   9  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [92 22 27 68 24 25 12  9 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider both the value each agent places on the items and try to distribute the items as evenly as possible. Given the table of valuations, we can use a simple approach to assign items so that each agent ideally gets a similar total value or number of items. 

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Items [3, 5] - This selection includes the high-value items for Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Items [0, 8] - These are some of the highest value items for Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Items [2, 6] - These items are highly valued by Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Items [1, 4, 7] - These items provide a balance in value for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Item [] - This agent does not receive any items.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations and the total number of items is exactly 9.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0, 8],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 4, 7],
    "4": []
}
```
