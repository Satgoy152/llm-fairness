Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  28  44  81  46  36   2  94  95
1  57  40  59  10  65  74  78  11  38
2  94  36  30   9  46  76  62  61  98
3  21   9  87  31  23   0  26  82  19
4  14  31  22  44  42  61  95  85  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their individual utilities while ensuring that all items are distributed. Given the valuations, we can attempt to allocate the items so that each agent has a fair share according to the values they place on the items.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 highly values items 3 (81), 7 (94), and 8 (95).
2. Agent 1 values item 6 (78) and item 5 (74).
3. Agent 2 values item 0 (94) and item 8 (98).
4. Agent 3 values item 2 (87) and item 7 (82).
5. Agent 4 values item 6 (95).

However, since items cannot be allocated to multiple agents, we need to adjust the allocation for the best overall distribution.

Let's allocate based on maximizing individual agent utility with a focus on fairness:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 7
- Agent 1: Items 5, 6
- Agent 2: Items 0, 8
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 1, 4

This ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Now, here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [5, 6],
    "2": [0, 8],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
