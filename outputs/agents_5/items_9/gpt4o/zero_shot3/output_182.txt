Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  62  98  95  67   0  54  86  52
1  69  50  86  67  22  61  70  86  69
2   0  90  29  17  75  71   9  29  38
3  23  30  95  10  44  73  35  83  55
4  55  45  97  31  72  79  25  85  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Given that each agent may value items differently, a common approach is to use a combination of maximizing individual utilities and ensuring an equitable distribution.

Let's proceed with a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3. We can allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent has a relatively high valuation for item 6 and a decent valuation for item 5. We can allocate these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 1 the highest. We can allocate this item to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 7 the highest. We can allocate this item to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Finally, Agent 4 has high valuations for items 4 and 8. We can allocate these items to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, taking into account their respective values. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [6, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction for each agent based on their valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.
