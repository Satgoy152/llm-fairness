Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  86  34  83  29  70   9  60   0  80
1  25  68  41  29  79  13  49  83  14
2  31  37  76  18   8  14   1  57  13
3  18   1  91  56  55  94  44  63  87
4  38  32  70  27  52  25  49  25  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll try to consider the agents' valuations and distribute the items such that each agent receives a set of items that maximizes their overall satisfaction relative to others. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

1. Start by identifying any unique high-value items for each agent and assign them accordingly.
2. Continue assigning items to agents based on the next highest value that hasn't been allocated yet.
3. Ensure that every item is allocated, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's implement this strategy for the given table:

- **Agent 0** has a strong preference for items 0 (86) and 2 (83). Assign these to Agent 0.
- **Agent 1** values item 7 (83) highly. We assign item 7 to Agent 1.
- **Agent 2** does not have any extremely high values compared to others, so we assign item 1 (37) and item 3 (18) based on their relative values.
- **Agent 3** values item 5 (94) the most. We assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4** values item 8 (95) the highest. Assign item 8 to Agent 4.
- For remaining items, assign item 4 to Agent 1 and item 6 to Agent 3 based on the next highest relative valuations.

Now, let's format this allocation into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4, 7],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5, 6],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents while trying to respect their preferences as much as possible.
