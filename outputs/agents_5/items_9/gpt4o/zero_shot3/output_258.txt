Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  69  33  72  22  44  26   7  84  53
1  33  68  66  16  82  13   3  65  35
2  56  85  70  55  45  97  92  43  80
3  37  93  78  78  30  14  49  52  57
4  93  36  93  35  74  88   2  12  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: Start by identifying which items each agent values the most. This helps in ensuring that each agent gets the items they value highly.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations**: Start allocating items to agents based on their individual highest valuations, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Adjust the allocation so that each of the 9 items is allocated to exactly one agent.

Here is one possible allocation based on the above method:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (value 72).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (value 82).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (value 97).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (value 93).
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (value 93).

After these initial allocations, we continue to allocate the remaining items while ensuring each agent receives items they value:

- Allocate item 7 to Agent 0 (value 84).
- Allocate item 8 to Agent 2 (value 80).
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3 (value 78).
- Allocate item 6 to Agent 4 (value 2, since it's the least valued item by all agents).

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 8],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items, the total number of items allocated is 9, and each agent gets items they value relatively highly.
