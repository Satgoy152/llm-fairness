Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  30  18   4  48  68  19  27  67
1  78  23  89   4  39  51  75  62  28
2  39   9  93  61  53   0   3  22  82
3  41  86  62  34   3  69  53  83  50
4  27   2  60  65  20  82  49  69  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on maximizing the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items: 5 (68), 8 (67)
   - Allocated items: [5, 8]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items: 2 (89), 0 (78)
   - Allocated items: [2, 0]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items: 2 (93), 8 (82), but item 2 is already taken.
   - Next highest available: 4 (53), 3 (61)
   - Allocated items: [3, 4]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items: 1 (86), 7 (83)
   - Allocated items: [1, 7]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Remaining item: 6
   - Allocated items: [6]

All items have been allocated fairly according to the given valuations, with each agent receiving an integer number of items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 8],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [6]
}
```
