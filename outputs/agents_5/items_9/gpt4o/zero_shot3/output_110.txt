Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  35  22  13  97  66  13  79  33  27
1  68  34  38  61  94  39  64  26   5
2  95  34  78  38  63  27  17  30   0
3   8  62  36   3   1   5  41  38  10
4  69  16   0  70  74  46  59  72  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute them such that each agent receives a reasonable share based on their valuations. We will consider the highest value an agent has for an item and attempt to assign items accordingly while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 3 (97) has the highest value for agent 0, allocate to agent 0.
   - Item 6 (79) has a high value, allocate to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 4 (94) has the highest value for agent 1, allocate to agent 1.
   - Item 0 (68) is the next highest value, allocate to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2 (78) has the highest value for agent 2, allocate to agent 2.
   - Item 1 (34) matches agent 2's highest remaining available value, allocate to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 7 (38) has the highest value for agent 3, allocate to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 5 (46) has the highest value for agent 4, allocate to agent 4.
   - Item 8 (64) has the highest value, allocate to agent 4.

Now, let's ensure that all allocations are made correctly, and each agent gets their allocated items. Here's the final JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [4, 0],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [5, 8]
}
```
