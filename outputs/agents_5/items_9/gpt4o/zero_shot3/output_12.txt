Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  26   7  46  77   5   9  34  46  99
1  32  33  72  83  68  86   2  34   0
2  35  62  29  40  76  78  68  60  66
3  86  43  68  56  61  39  29  24  85
4   9  51  65  16  81  41  96  52  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. A common approach is to use a method like maximizing the total valuation or ensuring equitable distribution based on the given valuations. Here's one way to allocate the items based on maximizing the total value:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent assigns to any item and allocate that item to them if it hasn't already been allocated.
2. Continue the process ensuring no item is allocated more than once and each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Following this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 8 highest (value 99).
- Agent 1 values item 3 highest (value 83).
- Agent 2 values item 5 highest (value 78).
- Agent 3 values item 0 highest (value 86).
- Agent 4 values item 6 highest (value 96).

Then allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0: item 2 (value 46).
- Agent 1: item 4 (value 68).
- Agent 2: item 7 (value 60).
- Agent 3: item 1 (value 43).

This allocation ensures a fair distribution based on the highest values and remaining items. Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 2],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5, 7],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [6]
}
```
