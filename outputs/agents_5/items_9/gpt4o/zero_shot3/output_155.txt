Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  82  66   5  56  80  45  88  20
1  89  89   0  11  96  76  40  47  98
2  83  83  76  69  48  82  70  19  80
3  53  63  13   3   7  96  59   7  30
4  66  66  83  93  92   2  49  85  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets a fair share. Here's a step-by-step allocation process that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 7 the highest at 88. We allocate item 7 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 96. We allocate item 4 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 83 (note: item 1 is the same valuation but will be considered for another agent). We allocate item 0 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 5 the highest at 96. We allocate item 5 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 3 the highest at 93. We allocate item 3 to agent 4.

Now that each agent has received at least one item, we will allocate the remaining items to maximize the total valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items:

6. **Remaining Items**: Items 1, 2, 6, and 8 are available for allocation.

   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 82, which is the highest among all agent valuations. Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
   - Item 2: Agent 4 values it at 83, which is the highest among all agent valuations. Allocate item 2 to agent 4.
   - Item 6: Agent 2 values it at 70, which is the highest among all agent valuations. Allocate item 6 to agent 2.
   - Item 8: Agent 1 values it at 98, which is the highest among all agent valuations. Allocate item 8 to agent 1.

Based on the above allocation strategy, we have the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [4, 8],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share of the items, maximizing their valuations, and all items are allocated.
