Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  52  36  78  44  17   0  24  84
1  46  48  63  53  36  47  70  45  85
2  47  75  25  93   0  99  44  77  91
3  20  69  64  63  23  62  85  60  62
4  62  87  82  56  64  77  48   8  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one method is to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 9.

1. **Evaluate Agent Preferences:**
   - We can calculate the maximum valuation each agent has for the items.

2. **Allocation Strategy:**
   - Assign items based on the highest valuation for each agent, but ensure each agent receives at least one item.

3. **Implementation:**
   - We'll loop through and allocate items based on descending order of valuations to ensure maximum utility.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: The highest value is for item 3 (value 78).
- **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 8 (value 85).
- **Agent 2**: The highest value is for item 5 (value 99).
- **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 6 (value 85).
- **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 1 (value 87).

After the first round, the remaining items are 0, 2, 4, 7. We will allocate these based on the next highest values for agents who already have fewer items:

- **Agent 2**: Next highest is item 8 (value 91).
- **Agent 4**: Next highest is item 2 (value 82).
- **Agent 1**: Next highest is item 7 (value 45).
- **Agent 0**: Next highest is item 4 (value 44).

**Final Allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [8, 7],
    "2": [5, 0],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is 9.
