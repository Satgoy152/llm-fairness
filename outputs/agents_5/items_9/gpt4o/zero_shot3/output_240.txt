Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 2.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  84  57  47  46  54   1  43  57  93
1  40   1   2  31  25  77  34   7  82
2  69  46  87  58  50  28  37  46  25
3  36  72  70  76  35  64  34  29   6
4  51  80   1  62  59  41  27  25  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 80  1 62 59 41 27 25 27]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent receives an appropriate share of items. Here's one way to distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 8 (93) and item 0 (84), so we allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 5 (77) and item 8 (82). However, item 8 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 2 (87), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 1 (72) and 3 (76), so we allocate these items to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 1 (80), but item 1 is already allocated to Agent 3. The next highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 4 (59), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now let's allocate the remaining items 6 and 7:

- Agent 0 could also benefit from item 7 (57), so we allocate item 7 to Agent 0.
- Agent 2 could benefit from item 6 (37), so we allocate item 6 to Agent 2.

This results in each agent receiving the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8, 7],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 6],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
