Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   8  20  10  30  22  25  15  85  75
1  74  61  85  35  44  70  46  57   6
2   6  43  58   9  84  60  20   2  86
3  43  12  10  68  85  62  25  86  97
4  11  39  88  58   3  27  98  46  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring that all items are distributed. A common way to approach this is by using a greedy algorithm, allocating items to the agent who values them the most, and ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.
2. Adjust the allocation to ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 74.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 61.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most at 88.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 68.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 84.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 70.
- Item 6: Agent 4 values it the most at 98.
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the most at 86.
- Item 8: Agent 3 values it the most at 97.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item by re-evaluating and making necessary adjustments if some agents do not receive any items:

- Agent 0 has no items allocated initially, so we'll give them item 6, which they value at 15; this means removing item 6 from agent 4.
  
Final allocations ensuring all items are distributed and each agent has at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 7, 8],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed.
