Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  32  69  63  15  36  31  69  47  92
1   4  22  97  16  48  57  79  81  99
2  45  36  97  82   6  48  74  18  44
3  17  51  43   2   8  87  16  76  89
4  72  44   4  82  31  76  58  73  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that involves optimizing the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item.

First, let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Identify the highest valuation for each item:** We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that each item goes to the agent who has the highest preference for it.

2. **Assign the items:** We iterate through each item and assign it to the agent who has the highest valuation for that item.

3. **Check for fairness:** Ensure that each agent receives at least one item. If an agent ends up with no items, reassign items to ensure that every agent has at least one.

Let's implement this approach:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by agent 4 (value = 72)
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value = 69)
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by agent 1 and 2 (value = 97), let's choose agent 1
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by agent 2 and 4 (value = 82), let's choose agent 2
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value = 48)
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by agent 3 (value = 87)
- Item 6: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value = 79)
- Item 7: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value = 81)
- Item 8: Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value = 99)

At this point, all items are allocated, but agent 3 has no items. To correct this, let's reassign some items to ensure everyone gets at least one:

Reassign item 7 from agent 1 to agent 3 (agent 3's valuation = 76).

Now, let's format the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4, 6, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5, 7],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents with each agent receiving at least one item.
