Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  74  93  20  77  26  64  93  61
1  86  40  92  13  74  84  13  41  16
2  17  43  39  92  17   8  19  58  85
3  78  83  71   1  94  99  48  88  77
4  37  28  73  16  67  17  79  16  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a method that maximizes overall satisfaction based on the valuations given. Here, we will aim to balance the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

We'll follow a strategy where we assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that no agent gets more items than necessary to maintain a fair distribution. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 2 and 7.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 0 and 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 8.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 3 and 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 6 and 1.

Based on this strategy, we aim to distribute the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 7]
- Agent 1: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 2: Items [8]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 4: Items [6, 1]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations while all 9 items are allocated. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [6, 1]
}
```
