Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  12  25  87  47  92  38  90  98
1  89  62  96  85  21   1  42  13  53
2  36  23  70  48   0  26  40  63  66
3  65  93  17  71  16   3  76  51  83
4  72  85  72  81  15  11  32   1  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we'll aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. This kind of problem is often approached with algorithms designed for fair division, like the "max-min" allocation, but given the constraints, we can manually allocate by trying to maximize individual agent satisfaction.

Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest valuation is for item 8 with a value of 98.
2. **Agent 1:** The highest valuation is for item 2 with a value of 96.
3. **Agent 2:** The highest valuation is for item 2 with a value of 70, but item 2 is already allocated. The next highest is item 8 with a value of 66, but item 8 is also allocated. The next highest is item 3 with a value of 48.
4. **Agent 3:** The highest valuation is for item 1 with a value of 93.
5. **Agent 4:** The highest valuation is for item 1 with a value of 85, but item 1 is already allocated. The next highest is item 3 with a value of 81, but item 3 is already allocated. The next highest is item 0 with a value of 72.

Continuing this process, we ensure that each agent gets at least one item and that items are allocated based on the highest available valuations. Keeping track of already allocated items, let's finalize the allocations:

- **Agent 0:** Items [8]
- **Agent 1:** Items [2]
- **Agent 2:** Items [6]
- **Agent 3:** Items [1, 7]
- **Agent 4:** Items [0, 3, 4, 5]

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [0, 3, 4, 5]
}
```
