Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  97  19  17  84  48  80  27  22  42
1  83  88  44  91  29  84  27  39  72
2  49  84  25  49  11  61  77  31  75
3  90   7  29  68  22  44  66  73  62
4  64  58  93  35   6  71  34  69  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the maximum valuations of each agent for the items. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Since there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Agent:**
   - Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (97).
   - Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (91).
   - Agent 2 values item 6 the highest (77).
   - Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (90).
   - Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (93).

2. **Allocate Items Based on Maximum Valuation:**
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
   - Allocate item 6 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
   - Allocate item 7 to Agent 3 (next highest for Agent 3).

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:**
   - After initial allocation, items 1, 4, 5, and 8 remain unallocated.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 1 (next highest value after item 3).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0).
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 4 (next highest value for Agent 4).
   - Allocate item 8 to Agent 3 (next highest value for Agent 3).

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here are the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

Each agent has been allocated at least one item, and all items have been distributed.
