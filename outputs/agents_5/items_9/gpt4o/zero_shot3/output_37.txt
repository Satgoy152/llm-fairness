Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  90  39  84  95  96  94  64  27
1  87  73  21  14   5  48  32  41  54
2  43  67  51  58   4  84  36   5  59
3  19  45  49   9  93  87  47  45  34
4  63  91  22  40  46   6  76  65  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we can aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations. A balanced approach could involve ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, with the remaining items distributed based on preference to maximize overall value.

Let's evaluate and allocate based on the table provided:

1. **Highest Priority Allocations**:
   - Assign items based on highest single valuations, ensuring the agent has at least one item.

2. **Further Distributions**:
   - Allocate remaining items to agents who have fewer items, based on their next highest valuations.

**Step-by-step Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is item 5 (value 96), assign item 5.
- **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is item 0 (value 87), assign item 0.
- **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is item 5 (value 84), but it's taken, next is item 3 (value 58), assign item 3.
- **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is item 4 (value 93), assign item 4.
- **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is item 1 (value 91), assign item 1.

At this point, each agent has at least one item:

- Remaining items: 2, 6, 7, 8

**Next Allocation:**

- **Agent 0**: Next highest valuation is item 4 (value 95), but it's taken, next is item 6 (value 94), assign item 6.
- **Agent 2**: Next highest valuation is item 5 (value 84), but it's taken, next is item 8 (value 59), assign item 8.
- **Agent 4**: Next highest valuation is item 0 (value 63), but it's taken, next is item 7 (value 65), assign item 7.
- **Agent 1**: Remaining item is 2, assign item 2.

**Final Allocation:**

Now, all items are distributed:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3, 8],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```

Each agent has received a fair number of items based on their preferences, and a total of 9 items are allocated.
