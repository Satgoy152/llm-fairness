Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  82   4   6  42  61  84  21  91  22
1  42  89  24   6  43  54  58  86  13
2  33  22  23  25  94  48  76  99  69
3  67  71  41  17  98  17  20  65  39
4  24  44  29  18  40  56  48  63   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to give each agent items that maximize their total valuation, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 highly values items 0, 5, and 7. Assigning item 0 (82) to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 highly values items 1 and 7. Assigning item 1 (89) to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 highly values items 4 and 7. Assigning item 7 (99) to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 highly values items 4 and 1. Assigning item 4 (98) to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has no particularly high value item compared to others, but can take some remaining items. Assigning item 5 (56) to Agent 4.

Next, we allocate the remaining items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

6. **Agent 0**: Already has item 0. Assign: 6 (21).
7. **Agent 1**: Already has item 1. Assign: 2 (24).
8. **Agent 2**: Already has item 7. Assign: 8 (69).
9. **Agent 3**: Already has item 4. Assign: 3 (17).

Now, each agent has items such that their total valuation is maximized and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [7, 8],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
