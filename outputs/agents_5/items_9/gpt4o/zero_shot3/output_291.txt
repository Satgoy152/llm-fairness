Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  50  73  86  33   7  60  34  28  47
1  11  45  66  77  24  29  58  83  61
2  33   8  34  51  81  53  90  42  25
3  97  66  53  28  74  81  92  36  22
4  60  71  50  48  21  73  92  94  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents while maximizing their valuations, we can consider a fair distribution where each agent receives at least one item and no agent receives more than necessary. 

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 86). Assign item 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 7 (value 83). Assign item 7 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 6 (value 90). Assign item 6 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 0 (value 97). Assign item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 7 (value 94), but it is already taken by Agent 1. The next highest is item 6 (value 92), but it is already taken by Agent 2. The next highest is item 5 (value 73). Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we have 4 items left (1, 3, 4, and 8) and need to distribute them among the agents:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 1 (value 73).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (value 77).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (value 81).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 8 (value 22).

Thus, the allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [7, 3],
    "2": [6, 4],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair number of items with higher valuations for their preferences.
