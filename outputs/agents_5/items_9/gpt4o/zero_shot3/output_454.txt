Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  20  92  85  68  77   2  44  68
1  79  78  10   1  94  72  36  73  89
2  77  56   8   6  84  91  13  71  54
3  14  54  91  66  84  35  33  19  49
4   9  45  42  37  32  90  63  44  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate total valuations for each agent:** Sum up the valuations for each agent across all items to get a sense of which items are most valuable to each agent.

2. **Allocate items based on highest valuations:** Begin by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuation for those items, ensuring that each item is only allocated once.

3. **Ensure each agent gets at least one item:** Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

4. **Check total allocation:** Verify that exactly 9 items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (92), and item 3 (85), so we can assign these to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 4 (94), so we assign it to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (91), so we assign it to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 highly values item 2 (91), but since it’s already taken, we assign item 1 (54) to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 highly values item 5 (90), but since it’s already taken, we assign item 6 (63) to Agent 4.

Adjust and assign the remaining items to ensure each agent receives at least one item and all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6, 7, 8, 0]
}
```
Note: This allocation respects the constraints and distributes all 9 items, ensuring each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations.
