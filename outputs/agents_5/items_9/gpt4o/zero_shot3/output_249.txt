Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  64  63  40  16  96   4  24  86  35
1  76  12  75  55  67  24  27  93  72
2   9  81  54  62  17   0  33  42  88
3  47   2  67  86  28  49  16  61  95
4  11  96  14  74  43  12  31  77  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while maximizing the total valuation and ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a simple allocation strategy. Let's analyze the valuations and try to distribute the items based on the highest value each agent places on them, ensuring all items are allocated.

Let's consider allocating based on each agent's highest value for the items, ensuring that no item is allocated more than once:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 4 (96) and 7 (86).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 7 (93) and 0 (76).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 8 (88) and 1 (81).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for items 8 (95) and 3 (86).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 1 (96) and 7 (77).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 4 to **Agent 0** (value: 96).
- Assign item 7 to **Agent 1** (value: 93).
- Assign item 8 to **Agent 3** (value: 95).
- Assign item 1 to **Agent 4** (value: 96).
- Assign item 0 to **Agent 1** (value: 76).
- Assign item 3 to **Agent 3** (value: 86).
- Assign item 2 to **Agent 0** (value: 40).
- Assign item 5 to **Agent 3** (value: 49).
- Assign item 6 to **Agent 2** (value: 33).

Ensure all agents have an integer number of items, and all nine items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [7, 0],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [8, 3, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed with consideration to maximizing valuations and fairness.
