Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  21  84  82  98   1  28  73  87   1
1  59  27  39  60  55  91   6  88  17
2   7   3  77  52  96  94  27   2  28
3  41  93  49  84  35  31  17  93  64
4  64  90  19  79  45  78  53  65  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total value while ensuring that all 9 items are distributed. Here is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 3, 1, and 7. 
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 5.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 4.
4. **Agent 3** has high valuations for items 1 and 7.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 0.

Given these insights, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign items 1 and 7 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

This leaves us with items 2, 6, and 8. To distribute these remaining items:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it relatively high.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 4, as they have a moderate valuation for it.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3, as they have a moderate valuation for it.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 7, 8],
    "4": [0, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
