Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62   9  65  72  58  12  27  64  46
1  99  62   9  19  61  49  50  85  38
2  68  96   9  62   6  89  35  62  20
3  12  52  91  21   1  41   7  42  58
4  21  97  29   1  12  51  45   0  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate all the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item (if possible) and exactly 9 items are allocated in total.

Let's go through one way to allocate these items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values are for items 3 and 2.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values are for items 0 and 7.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values are for items 1 and 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values are for item 2.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values are for items 1 and 7.

Now, let's assign these items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (highest value for Agent 3).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (highest value for Agent 0).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2 (highest value for Agent 2).
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (third highest value for Agent 1).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 4 (highest value for Agent 4).
- Assign item 8 to Agent 4 (second highest value for Agent 4).

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0, 4, 6],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [7, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to maximize overall satisfaction based on the agents' valuations.
