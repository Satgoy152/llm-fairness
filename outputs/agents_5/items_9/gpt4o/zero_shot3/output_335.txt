Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  79  87  74   7  10  27  57  19  11
1  62  36  10  15  58  61  19  36  83
2  85  81  48  33  96   8  75  35  65
3  21  92  53  79  53  69  17  68  65
4  91  21  85  83  26   5   7  45  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use an approach that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the constraint of integer allocations and the need to distribute exactly 9 items, we'll also try to balance the number of items each agent receives as evenly as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 0 the most (79).
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 8 the most (83).
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 4 the most (96).
4. **Agent 3**: They value item 1 the most (92).
5. **Agent 4**: They value item 0 the most (91), but it's already taken, so the next highest is item 2 (85).

Given these preferences, let's start by assigning these items to the agents:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 8.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 2.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 4 more items.

Next, we'll distribute the remaining items based on the remaining highest values, avoiding conflicts with already assigned items:

6. **Agent 0**: Next highest value is item 6 (57).
7. **Agent 3**: Next highest value is item 3 (79).
8. **Agent 2**: Next highest value is item 6 (75), but it's already taken, so item 7 (35).
9. **Agent 4**: Next highest value is item 3 (83), but it's already taken, so item 7 (45), but it's already taken, so item 5 (5).

Now, let's finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: [0, 6]
- Agent 1: [8]
- Agent 2: [4, 7]
- Agent 3: [1, 3]
- Agent 4: [2, 5]

The allocations are complete, and all 9 items have been allocated. Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4, 7],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```
