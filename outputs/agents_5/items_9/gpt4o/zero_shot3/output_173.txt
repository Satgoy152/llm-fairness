Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29   0  21  22  74  47  38  74  34
1  79  18  69  26  76  77  30  82   9
2  60  79  77  97  70  36  86  66  79
3  16  14  62  34  65  94  28   4  71
4  92  33  34  54  65  93  99  32   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. Given that there are 9 items and 5 agents, each agent should ideally receive about 1 to 2 items. 

Let's proceed with the allocation process:

1. **Assign highest value items to each agent first:**
   - Agent 0 highly values item 4 (74) and item 7 (74).
   - Agent 1 highly values item 7 (82).
   - Agent 2 highly values item 3 (97).
   - Agent 3 highly values item 5 (94).
   - Agent 4 highly values item 6 (99).

2. **Re-evaluate unallocated items and distribute them to maximize overall satisfaction:**
   - Agent 0: Already has item 4 and item 7.
   - Agent 1: Assign item 5 (77) as Agent 3 already got item 5.
   - Agent 2: Already has item 3 and can also take item 8 (79).
   - Agent 3: Already has item 5.
   - Agent 4: Already has item 6.

3. **Handle remaining items (0, 1, 2):**
   - Agent 1 can take item 0 (79).
   - Agent 2 can take item 2 (77).
   - Agent 4 can take item 1 (33).

After the allocation process, here is the result:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 7],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3, 8, 2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [6, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their values, with a total of 9 items allocated.
