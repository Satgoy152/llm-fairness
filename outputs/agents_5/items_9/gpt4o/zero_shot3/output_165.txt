Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  62  77  33  30  80  64  20  59  73
1  19  49  52  74  53  83  33   2  96
2  52  80  78  37  51  16  33  82  81
3  88  30  75  12   4   8  97  20  94
4   2  71  40  71  82  16  31  56  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their total valuation while considering the overall fairness of the distribution. We will attempt to distribute the items so that each agent has a relatively equal opportunity to get highly valued items according to their individual valuations. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (80), Item 1 (77)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (83), Item 8 (96)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (80), Item 2 (78)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 6 (97), Item 8 (94)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuations: Item 4 (82), Item 3 (71)

Now, let's allocate the items based on these valuations while ensuring each item is assigned only once:

- Assign Item 4 to Agent 0
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 1
- Assign Item 8 to Agent 3
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 4
- Assign Item 6 to Agent 3 (second highest for Agent 3)
- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0 (remaining high value for Agent 0)
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 2 (second highest for Agent 2)
- Assign Item 7 to Agent 4 (remaining high value for Agent 4)

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of items based on their valuations, while ensuring all items are distributed.
