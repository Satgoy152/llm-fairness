Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  10  87  71  99  45  74  53  86  44
1  13  69  76  89  31  43   5  29  18
2  82  62  18  99  25  17  56   0  14
3  77  55  68  89  72  87  42  98  55
4   6  90  61   4  95  16  46  87   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. Below is a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent highly values items 3 and 1 (valuations of 99 and 87 respectively).

2. **Agent 1**: This agent highly values item 2 (valuation of 76).

3. **Agent 2**: This agent highly values item 0 and 3 (valuations of 82 and 99 respectively).

4. **Agent 3**: This agent highly values item 7 (valuation of 98).

5. **Agent 4**: This agent highly values item 4 (valuation of 95).

Now, we aim to allocate these items such that each agent receives a fair number of items based on their preferences. Here's one way to do it:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 5 (valuations of 87, 74).
- Agent 1 receives items 2, 8 (valuations of 76, 18).
- Agent 2 receives items 0, 6 (valuations of 82, 56).
- Agent 3 receives items 3, 7 (valuations of 89, 98).
- Agent 4 receives item 4 (valuation of 95).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a fair share of items based on their highest preferences. Let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4]
}
```
