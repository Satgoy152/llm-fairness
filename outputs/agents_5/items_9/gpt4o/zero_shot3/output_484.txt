Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  53  87  18  47  96  53  77  86
1  76  55   7  72  68  59  43   2  34
2  77  28  83  91  54  13  24  73   9
3  69   0   9  46  40  72  49  70   9
4  40  28  72  66  61  75  67  66  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and try to maximize the total satisfaction of all agents. One possible approach is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring no agent is left without items and the total number of allocated items is exactly nine.

Here's one possible fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 2, 5, and 8.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 0 and 3.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 3.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 5 and 7.
5. Agent 4 highly values item 6.

Based on this, we can attempt the following allocation:

- Agent 0: [2, 5, 8]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [1, 4, 6]

Let's present these allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 8],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [1, 4, 6]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all nine items are distributed among the agents.
