Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  89  32  64  94  69   5  17  20  48
1  29  51  71  46  68  34  86  90  73
2  80  34  20  36  97  80  89  20  70
3  28  35  21  92  47  61  86  88  52
4  23  14  65  86  12  56  23  96  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step strategy to achieve this:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each item.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing the individual agent's valuation for each item, while ensuring that the total number of items allocated equals 9.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item where possible, adjusting allocations as needed to achieve fairness.

Let's start by analyzing the valuation matrix:

```
Agent 0: [89, 32, 64, 94, 69,  5, 17, 20, 48]
Agent 1: [29, 51, 71, 46, 68, 34, 86, 90, 73]
Agent 2: [80, 34, 20, 36, 97, 80, 89, 20, 70]
Agent 3: [28, 35, 21, 92, 47, 61, 86, 88, 52]
Agent 4: [23, 14, 65, 86, 12, 56, 23, 96, 99]
```

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (89).
2. Item 1: Agent 2 has a moderate valuation (34) but no one else has higher interest for unallocated items.
3. Item 2: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (71).
4. Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (94).
5. Item 4: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (97).
6. Item 5: Agent 2 has a high valuation (80).
7. Item 6: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (86).
8. Item 7: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (96).
9. Item 8: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (99).

Now, let's allocate based on these valuations while ensuring fairness:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 6]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 4, 5]
- Agent 3: No items (balanced by ensuring others receive at least one item)
- Agent 4: Items [7, 8]

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 6],
    "2": [1, 4, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [7, 8]
}
```
