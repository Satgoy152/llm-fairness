Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  36  44  18  35  60  76  63  53
1  58  83  37   3  22  91  46  84  57
2  62  80  45   2  60  36   8  84   8
3  20  66  54   3   6  80  35  96  73
4  47  37  61  45  68  39  34  85  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all the items are allocated. We will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while distributing the items as evenly as possible among the agents.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly, so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 very highly, so allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most, so allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 7 the highest, so allocate item 7 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values items 4 and 8 highly, so allocate items 4 and 8 to agent 4.
- Allocate the remaining items (2, 3, 6) based on the next highest valuations that haven't been allocated yet:

  - Agent 0: Allocate item 6
  - Agent 1: Allocate item 2
  - Agent 3: Allocate item 3

Now, we have distributed all 9 items. Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 7],
    "4": [4, 8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed according to their valuations.
