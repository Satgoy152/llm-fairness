Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   7  43  68  78   3  33  46  43  86
1  68  98  35   1   4  49  72  27  24
2  25  74  60  67  15   1  24  17  76
3  96  62  39  93  95   2  64  13  48
4  96  88   3  48  14   5  91  37  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocate items that maximize the total value for this agent, starting with the highest value items:
   - Item 8: Value 86
   - Item 3: Value 78

2. **Agent 1**: Allocate items that maximize the total value for this agent:
   - Item 1: Value 98
   - Item 0: Value 68

3. **Agent 2**: Allocate items that maximize the total value for this agent:
   - Item 2: Value 60

4. **Agent 3**: Allocate items that maximize the total value for this agent:
   - Item 4: Value 95

5. **Agent 4**: Allocate the remaining items:
   - Item 5: Value 5
   - Item 6: Value 91
   - Item 7: Value 37

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 3],
    "1": [1, 0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 6, 7]
}
```
