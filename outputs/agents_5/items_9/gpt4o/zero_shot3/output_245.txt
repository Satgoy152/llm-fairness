Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  66  22  23  57  10  91  20  70  93
1  34   2  30  59  80  77   9  67  98
2  12  49  74  50  47   1  87  92  97
3  93  78   3  17  22  67  12  13  33
4  25  65  71  43  91  86  52  87   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation for the items. We should aim to allocate items in such a way that each agent gets a reasonable share of value, if not quantity. Let's proceed step-by-step:

1. **Identify the highest valued items for each agent:**
   - Agent 0: Highest values are for items 8 (93), 5 (91), and 7 (70).
   - Agent 1: Highest values are for items 8 (98), 4 (80), and 5 (77).
   - Agent 2: Highest values are for items 8 (97), 7 (92), and 6 (87).
   - Agent 3: Highest values are for items 0 (93), 1 (78), and 5 (67).
   - Agent 4: Highest values are for items 4 (91), 5 (86), and 7 (87).

2. **Allocate items based on preferences while ensuring no overlap:**
   - Agent 0: Allocate item 8 (93)
   - Agent 1: Allocate item 4 (80)
   - Agent 2: Allocate item 7 (92)
   - Agent 3: Allocate item 0 (93)
   - Agent 4: Allocate item 5 (86)

3. **Allocate remaining items to ensure each agent gets a reasonable value:**
   - Remaining items: 1, 2, 3, 6
   - Consider next highest available values for each agent:
     - Agent 0: Item 1 (22)
     - Agent 1: Item 3 (59)
     - Agent 2: Item 6 (87)
     - Agent 3: Item 2 (3)
     - Agent 4: Item 2 (71) (since this is a better value for agent 4 than agent 3)

4. **Finalize allocation:**

```json
{
    "0": [8, 1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [7, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all agents receive items, each agent gets a reasonable share of high-value items according to their preferences, and all 9 items are distributed.
