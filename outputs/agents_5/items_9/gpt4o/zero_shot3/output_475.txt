Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  55  87  14  42  20  64  22  91  37
1  70  28  58  84  61  39  70  89  80
2  18  51  52  29  24  46  39  26  36
3  20  27  16  15  44  73  90  69  19
4  39   5  41  23  74  68  29   5  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that considers the valuations. One common approach is to use a round-robin allocation based on the highest value an agent has for the remaining items. This method should ensure a fair distribution of items based on the agents' preferences.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value is 91 for item 7.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value is 89 for item 7, but it's already taken.
   - Next highest is 84 for item 3.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value is 52 for item 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value is 90 for item 6.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value is 89 for item 8.

Now, allocating remaining items:

- **Remaining Items**: 0, 1, 4, 5

Continuing the allocation:

6. **Agent 0**: 
   - Next highest value is 87 for item 1.

7. **Agent 1**: 
   - Next highest value is 80 for item 8, but it's already taken.
   - Next highest value is 70 for item 0.

8. **Agent 2**:
   - Next highest value is 51 for item 1, but it's already taken.
   - Next highest value is 46 for item 5.

9. **Agent 3**:
   - Most remaining value is 73 for item 5, but it's already taken.
   - Next highest remaining is 44 for item 4.

10. **Agent 4**:
    - All items are allocated.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [6, 4],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation respects the requirement that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.
