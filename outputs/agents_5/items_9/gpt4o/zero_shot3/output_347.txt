Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  48  91   7   6  29  40  16  80  54
1  63  45  27  41  78  72   4  19  38
2  90  46  40   0  45  48  34   7  49
3  50  57   2  21  98  22  49   5  64
4   2  92  61  90  91  50  65  87  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a high value for item 1 (91) and item 7 (80). Assign these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 4 (78) highly. Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 0 (90) highly. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 4 (98) highly, but item 4 is already taken. Assign item 8 (64) instead, as it's their next best option.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 (90) and item 1 (92) highly, but item 1 is already taken. Assign item 3 (90) to Agent 4.

Now, we have:
- Items 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, and 8 allocated.
- Items 2, 5, and 6 are still unallocated.

Let's allocate the remaining items:
- **Agent 0**: Already has items 1 and 7, no need for more.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 4, can take item 5 (72), which is their next best.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 0, can take item 6 (34), which is their next best.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 8, can take item 2 (49), which is their next best.
- **Agent 4**: Already has item 3, no need for more.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 7],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [8, 2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated fairly based on the agents' valuations.
