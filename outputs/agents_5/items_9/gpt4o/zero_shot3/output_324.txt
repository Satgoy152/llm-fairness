Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  75  34  61  30  95   1  81  13  41
1  90  76  57  69  11  74  96  60   9
2  36  50  37  45   7  40  85  72  78
3  28  46  50  42  78  17  64  72  78
4  78  53  40  21  79  92  12  39  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 9. We also aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation each agent has for the items they receive, while ensuring fairness.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4, so we allocate those to them.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 6 and 0, but since item 0 is already allocated to agent 0, we allocate item 6 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has relatively high valuation for item 8, so we allocate that to them.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 4, 7, and 8, but since item 8 is already allocated to agent 2, we allocate item 7 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 5 and 4, but since item 4 is already allocated to agent 0, we allocate item 5 to agent 4.

After this preliminary allocation, we still have some items unallocated. We can assign the remaining items to balance the number of items each agent receives:

- Agent 0 receives item 2 as well.
- Agent 1 receives item 3.
- Agent 3 receives item 1.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed among the agents, each agent has an integer number of items, and the allocation is reasonably balanced based on the agents' valuations.
