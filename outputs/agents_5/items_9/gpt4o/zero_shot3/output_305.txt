Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  46  78  17  92  48  65  90  84  51
1  24  37  82  93  52  38  58  58  46
2  68  98  26  49  74  72  16   4  45
3  99  38  83  72  80  50  13  10  54
4  80   1  36  80  44  76  34  57  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives the items that maximize their total valuation. Each agent should receive a fair share, considering the total number of items is 9 and each agent must receive at least one item (since we have 5 agents and 9 items, some agents will receive more than one item).

Here's an approach to allocate items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (92), Item 6 (90)
   
2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (93), Item 2 (82)
   
3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (98), Item 4 (74)
   
4. **Agent 3:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 2 (83)
   
5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (80), Item 5 (76)

To ensure a fair distribution, we should consider the overall highest valuations and distribute items accordingly without duplication and ensuring each agent gets a fair share. Here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 6 (90)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (93)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (98)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (99)
- Agent 4: Item 5 (76)

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate 4 more items, considering the next highest valuations and ensuring no agent gets more than 2 items except where necessary:

- Agent 0: Item 4 (48)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (82)
- Agent 2: Item 4 (74)
- Agent 3: Item 8 (54)

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their highest valuations and that all 9 items are allocated. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 4],
    "1": [3, 2],
    "2": [1, 7],
    "3": [0, 8],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed.
