Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0   5  37  95  64  43  73  35   0  86
1  15  99  25  99   0  16  88  29  90
2  85  83  74  42  34  32  31  42  72
3  50  32  88  28  70  29  73  19  14
4  96  88  95  41  60  69  33  80  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that considers the preferences of each agent based on their valuations. A simple approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns the highest valued item that hasn't been assigned yet to the agent who values it most. We'll ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated across the agents.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on their valuations:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 4 values it the most at 96.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it the most at 95.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 1 values it the most at 99.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 3 values it the most at 70.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it the most at 73.
7. **Item 6:** Agent 1 values it the most at 88.
8. **Item 7:** Agent 4 values it the most at 80.
9. **Item 8:** Agent 0 values it the most at 86.

Now, considering fairness, we need to adjust the allocation so that each agent gets a reasonable distribution of items. One possible fair allocation could look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5, 8],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 6, 7]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 2, 5, and 8.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 gets no items.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.
- Agent 4 gets items 0, 6, and 7.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item, except for agent 2 who values items the least in comparison to others.
