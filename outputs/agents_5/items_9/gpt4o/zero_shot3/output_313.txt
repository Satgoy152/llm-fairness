Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  27  98  91  59  85  56  78  46
1  23  73  58  48  67  40  11  76  86
2  35  88  32  25  99  99  40  84  39
3  57  11  54  19  82  90   8  52   6
4  72  35  21  98  70  51  30  30  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent assigns to the items and attempt to allocate the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each agent is assigned their most valued item, while ensuring that no item is allocated more than once and each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (98), Item 3 (91), Item 5 (85)
   
2. Agent 1:
   - Highest values: Item 8 (86), Item 1 (73), Item 4 (67)

3. Agent 2:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (99), Item 5 (99), Item 1 (88)

4. Agent 3:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (90), Item 4 (82), Item 0 (57)

5. Agent 4:
   - Highest values: Item 3 (98), Item 0 (72), Item 4 (70)

Let's try to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets Item 2 (98)
- Agent 1 gets Item 8 (86)
- Agent 2 gets Item 4 (99)
- Agent 3 gets Item 5 (90)
- Agent 4 gets Item 3 (98)

Now, we have allocated 5 items, we need to allocate 4 more:

- Agent 0 gets Item 0 (68)
- Agent 1 gets Item 1 (73)
- Agent 2 gets Item 6 (40)
- Agent 4 gets Item 7 (30)

With these allocations, each agent receives at least one item, and all 9 items are distributed. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [8, 1],
    "2": [4, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 7]
}
```
