Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  29  23   2  70  23  33  87  93  84
1  54  17  17  41  92  92  69  21  10
2  17  76  83  89  66  90  16  48  56
3  68  29  44  80  47  26  60  89  82
4  83  30  52  82  65  19  30  25  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and each item is only assigned to one agent. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. First, identify the item with the highest value for each agent.
2. Allocate each agent their highest-valued item.
3. Continue allocating remaining items to agents based on the next highest available value, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value is item 7 (93).
- Agent 1: Highest value is item 4 (92).
- Agent 2: Highest value is item 5 (90).
- Agent 3: Highest value is item 3 (80).
- Agent 4: Highest value is item 0 (83).

This allocation covers all agents, so distribute the remaining items to maximize total valuations:

- Remaining items: 1, 2, 6, 8.
- Agent 2 can get item 2 (83) as it is the next highest unallocated for them.
- Agent 3 can get item 8 (82).
- Agent 0 can get item 6 (87).
- Agent 4 can get item 1 (30) since other items have been allocated.

This results in each agent having at least one item, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [7, 6],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [3, 8],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed, maximizing the total valuation for the agents.
