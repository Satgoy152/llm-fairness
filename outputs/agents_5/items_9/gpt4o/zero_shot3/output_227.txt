Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  78  19  38  42  48  29  67  58  89
1  51  59  55  91  61  42  93  27  80
2  35  98  95  62  38  85  36  83  65
3   8   7  47  73  15  95  34  17  18
4  58  44  39   3   2  78  99  89  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items among the 5 agents, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items. One approach to achieve a fair allocation is to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring every agent receives at least one item, if possible. We will use a simple allocation method based on maximizing each agent's highest available value for an item, while ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high values for item 8 (89).
2. Agent 1 has high values for item 6 (93).
3. Agent 2 has high values for item 1 (98).
4. Agent 3 has high values for item 5 (95).
5. Agent 4 has high values for item 6 (99) but we will allocate item 7 (89) to agent 4 since agent 1 has already taken item 6.

We now have 4 more items to allocate. We will continue allocating based on remaining highest values:

6. Agent 0 takes item 0 (78).
7. Agent 1 takes item 3 (91).
8. Agent 2 takes item 2 (95).
9. Agent 3 takes item 4 (15).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest value preferences.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3, 6],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7]
}
```
