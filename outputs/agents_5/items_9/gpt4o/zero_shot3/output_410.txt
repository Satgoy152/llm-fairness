Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  30  30   4  51  83  17  22   3  16
1  96  81  88  26  11   2  66   5  65
2  56  72  16  27  51  60  68  68  67
3  59  31  34  79  89  33  14  17   0
4  56  35  26   9  63  46  91  61  77

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for the items. Our goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

First, let's analyze the highest values each agent has for the items:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (83).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (96).
- Agent 2 values item 6 the most (68).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most (89).
- Agent 4 values item 6 the most (91).

Given these observations, we can start by assigning the items with the highest individual values to maximize fairness.

Let's allocate the items step by step based on the above observations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible:

1. Give item 4 to Agent 3 (highest value).
2. Give item 0 to Agent 1 (highest value).
3. Give item 6 to Agent 4 (highest value).
4. Give item 2 to Agent 1 (second highest value for Agent 1).
5. Give item 1 to Agent 2 (second highest value for Agent 2).
6. Give item 3 to Agent 0 (second highest value for Agent 0).
7. Give item 8 to Agent 4 (second highest value for Agent 4).
8. Give item 5 to Agent 2 (third highest value for Agent 2).
9. Give item 7 to Agent 0 (remaining item).

Now, let's ensure all items (0-8) are allocated, and each agent has a fair share. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 7],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6, 8]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items based on the highest values observed while ensuring all items are allocated. Each agent receives a fair allocation based on their highest preferences as much as possible.
