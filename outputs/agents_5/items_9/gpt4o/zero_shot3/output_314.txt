Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  78  80  19  73  42  95  28  28
1  81  93  92  32   4  18  53  40  19
2  67  59  32  62  29  36  98  42  91
3  25  92  64  65   0  86  59  29  25
4  29  85  36  97  89   0  45  55  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent has an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the highest valuations:

- **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 81, which is the highest among all agents.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 93, which is the highest among all agents.
- **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 92, which is the highest among all agents.
- **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it at 97, which is the highest among all agents.
- **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it at 89, which is the highest among all agents.
- **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it at 86, which is the highest among all agents.
- **Item 6**: Agent 2 values it at 98, which is the highest among all agents.
- **Item 7**: Agent 4 values it at 55, which is the highest among all agents.
- **Item 8**: Agent 2 values it at 91, which is the highest among all agents.

Now let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0, 1, 2],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.
