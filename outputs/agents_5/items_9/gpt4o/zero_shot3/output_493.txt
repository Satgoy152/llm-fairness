Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  22  94  46  24  41   6  30  93  90
1  46  18  63  50   3  68  39  84  81
2  95  46  57   2  39  34  81  38  24
3  19  18  37  26  67  75  76  69  80
4  76   4   7  34  89  35  59  42  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items such that the allocation is as equitable as possible based on the agents' valuations. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents while ensuring each agent gets a fair share of the items. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1, 7, and 8. We can allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 and 5. We can allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 0. We can allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has high valuations for items 5, 6, and 8. We can allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 4 and 8. We can allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

1. Allocate item 6 to Agent 2, as they have a relatively high valuation for it.
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 3, as it balances their total valuation.
3. Allocate item 7 to Agent 1, as they have a decent valuation for it.
4. Allocate item 8 to Agent 0, as it complements their existing allocation.

After going through this process, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 8],
    "1": [2, 7],
    "2": [0, 6],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 5 agents, aiming to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
