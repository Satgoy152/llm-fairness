Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  94  46  94  68   4  43   0  11  87
1  26  27  17  10  80  19  82  98  56
2   2  18  75   5  17  93  37  70  44
3  88  20  95  33  99  95  28  58  58
4  46   8  18  49  68  12  59  89  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total satisfaction or valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 9 items are allocated.

To allocate fairly, we can take the following approach:

1. Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This ensures that the allocation is efficient in terms of maximizing total value.
2. If there are ties (i.e., two agents value an item equally), we can randomly decide or choose the agent with fewer items so far.
3. Ensure that the final allocation results in each agent having an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.

Let's go through this process for the provided table:

### Allocation Steps

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (94).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (46).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (95).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is by Agent 0 (68).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is by Agent 3 (99).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is by Agent 2 (93).
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (82).
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is by Agent 1 (98).
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is by Agent 4 (92).

Now, let's convert this into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [6, 7],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [8]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, all 9 items are allocated, and the allocation is efficient in terms of maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive.
