Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  68  25  84  84  24  25  28  71   9
1  37   7  72  73  53  17  68  91  76
2  79  65  19  64  32   9  32  54  24
3  40  76  84  51  89  75  14   3  58
4  93  69  72  27  16  25  99  39   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations for the items and aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share in terms of their valuations. Here is one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 2 and 3. We'll allocate these items to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 7 the highest, followed by item 8. We'll allocate these items to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent has a relatively high valuation for item 0. We'll allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 4 the highest. We'll allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent has high valuations for items 6 and 1. We'll allocate these items to Agent 4.

We will then check if all 9 items are allocated, and adjust if necessary to ensure each agent receives a fair distribution. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [7, 8],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [6, 1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items according to their valuations.
