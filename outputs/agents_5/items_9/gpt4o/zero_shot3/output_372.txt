Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  38  37  47  19  33  35  71  58  91
1  39  34  57  34   0  75  16  11  50
2  40  16  87  74  99  93  44  84  69
3  66  37  33  86  90  49  19  71  68
4   7  87  55  90  71  83  90  30  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 9 items are allocated.

Let's consider a simple allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item across all agents and allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation.
2. If an agent is allocated more items than others, reallocate to balance the distribution while trying to keep the total valuation as high as possible.

Following this strategy, here's an allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (40).
- Item 1: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (87).
- Item 2: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (87).
- Item 3: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (86).
- Item 4: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (99).
- Item 5: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (93).
- Item 6: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (71).
- Item 7: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (58).
- Item 8: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (91).

Now let's adjust the allocation to ensure fairness:

- Items 0 and 2 can be reallocated to Agent 1 and Agent 4 respectively. This ensures each agent gets at least some items.

Here's the adjusted allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 6, 7, 8
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5 
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Items 1, 2

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 7, 8],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
