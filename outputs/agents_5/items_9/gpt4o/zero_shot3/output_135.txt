Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  91  26  84  63  24  37  89  49  21
1  25  86   1  26  55  59  34  12  99
2  79  74   7  72  92  45  33  92  33
3  20  49  75  12  53  28  95  96   8
4  30  48   1  78  61  17  47  64  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[91 26 84 63 24 37 89 49 21]
 [25 86  1 26 55 59 34 12 99]
 [79 74  7 72 92 45 33 92 33]

 [30 48  1 78 61 17 47 64 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to assign items such that each agent receives approximately the same total valuation. We want to make sure that all 9 items are allocated, and each agent can receive zero or more items.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: Allocating item 0 (value 91), item 5 (value 37) for a total valuation of 128.
2. Agent 1: Allocating item 8 (value 99) for a total valuation of 99.
3. Agent 2: Allocating item 4 (value 92) for a total valuation of 92.
4. Agent 3: Allocating item 6 (value 95), item 7 (value 96) for a total valuation of 191.
5. Agent 4: Allocating item 1 (value 48), item 2 (value 1), item 3 (value 78) for a total valuation of 127.

The distribution of total valuations is reasonably fair given the constraints. Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [1, 2, 3]
}
```
