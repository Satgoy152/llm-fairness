Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  72  54  81  76  75  73  76  15  27
1  87  62  63  91  58  85  66  14  28
2  68   7   7  75  63  64  42  13  76
3   5  75  97  28  66  63  53  86  37
4   4   4  87   9  56  42  11  16  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that ensures each agent gets items with relatively high valuations according to their preferences. We need to ensure that each item is allocated to exactly one agent and that all 9 items are distributed.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: [2 (81), 3 (76), 6 (76)]
   - Allocate item 2 and item 6 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: [3 (91), 0 (87), 5 (85)]
   - Allocate item 3 and item 0 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: [8 (76), 3 (75), 5 (64)]
   - Item 3 is already allocated, allocate item 8 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: [2 (97), 1 (75), 7 (86)]
   - Allocate item 7 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: [2 (87), 4 (56)]
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 4 since item 2 is already allocated.

6. We still have items 1 and 5 left to allocate:
   - **Item 1**: 
     - Highest valuation remaining is by Agent 3 (75), allocate item 1 to agent 3.
   - **Item 5**: 
     - Highest valuation remaining is by Agent 1 (85), allocate item 5 to agent 1.

Now, each item is allocated, and each agent has items according to their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6],
    "1": [3, 0, 5],
    "2": [8],
    "3": [7, 1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
