Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  65  18  18  61  89  62  17  57  95
1  81  21  55  53  15  57   6  61   1
2  83  91  67  62  12  24  79  36  40
3  83  47  37   5  32  99  76  42  83
4  76  29  79  20  80  58  52  93   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we should aim to optimize the allocation in a way that considers each agent's valuation while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of items. Let's assign the items taking into account their preferences as well as ensuring that the allocation remains balanced.

To achieve this, we can follow a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed and that each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. Once each agent has at least one item, distribute the remaining items based on the next highest value for each agent, while ensuring no items are left unallocated.

Here is a possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 8 the most (valuation 95).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (valuation 81).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (valuation 91).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (valuation 99).
- Agent 4 values item 7 the most (valuation 93).

After assigning these, we have distributed 5 items. Now let's allocate the remaining 4 items to maximize each agent's total valuation:

- Remaining items: 2, 3, 4, 6.
- Agent 0 can take item 4 (valuation 89).
- Agent 1 can take item 3 (valuation 53).
- Agent 2 can take item 6 (valuation 79).
- Agent 4 can take item 2 (valuation 79).

After this allocation, all 9 items are allocated.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [8, 4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1, 6],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [7, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution is done to maximize the individual valuations based on the constraints provided.
