Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  53  40  85  26  21   5  36  83  37
1  39  55  48  22  95  60  90  79  33
2  60  83   8  97  36  35  99   1  72
3  47  81  41  22   5  77  44  92  80
4  69  94  21  78  48  36  58  95   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to distribute the total value as evenly as possible. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high values for items 2 and 7.
2. **Agent 1** values item 4 the most, followed by item 6.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 6, followed by item 3.
4. **Agent 3** values item 5 highly, followed by item 7.
5. **Agent 4** has high values for items 1 and 7.

Given these preferences, we'll allocate items to balance the total value each agent receives:

- **Agent 0**: Items 2 (85) and 7 (83), total value = 168.
- **Agent 1**: Items 4 (95) and 6 (90), total value = 185.
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (97), total value = 97.
- **Agent 3**: Item 5 (77), total value = 77.
- **Agent 4**: Items 0 (69), 1 (94), and 8 (5), total value = 168.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Total number of items allocated: 9
- Each agent gets at least one item, and the allocation aims to balance the total value.

Finally, here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 7],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 1, 8]
}
```
