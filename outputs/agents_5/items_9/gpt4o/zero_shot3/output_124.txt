Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  39  46  27  14   5  45  62  91  80
1  84  34  61  45  53  35  10  12  47
2  32  57  90  39  26  74  50  85   7
3  56  50  60  31  41  76   3  65  28
4  86  91  98   8   6  68  59  81  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items allocated to them. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives a fair share of the total value, while making sure all 9 items are allocated.

Let's distribute the items based on maximizing each agent's valuation for the items they receive. Here's one way to do this:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (value = 86)
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 4 (value = 91)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (value = 98)
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (value = 45)
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (value = 53)
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (value = 76)
7. Assign item 6 to Agent 0 (value = 62)
8. Assign item 7 to Agent 2 (value = 85)
9. Assign item 8 to Agent 0 (value = 80)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items and the total number of items allocated is 9.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [6, 8],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [7],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 1, 2]
}
```

This distribution aims to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations for the items they receive.
