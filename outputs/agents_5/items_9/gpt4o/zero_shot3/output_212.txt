Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  63  93  98   9  53  67   8  42  88
1  88  33  10  35   4   8  69   4  63
2  99  51  52  44  21  71  76  90  32
3  52  16   8  56  44  91  75  31  88
4  54  74  75  79  36   2  36  13  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for the items and try to ensure that each agent ends up with a reasonable share of the total valuation. This means that we need to balance the allocation so that each agent gets a fair portion of their most valued items. 

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Agent**: First, calculate the total valuation each agent has for all the items. This can help us determine how much value each agent stands to gain overall.

2. **Allocate the Items**: Start by allocating the items to the agents based on who values them the most. Continue this process while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share of their total valuation.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If any agent is significantly underrepresented in terms of their fair share of value, consider reallocating some items to balance the allocations.

4. **Ensure All Items are Allocated**: Finally, make sure that all 9 items are allocated among the agents.

Now, let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 2 (98), 1 (93), and 0 (63).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (88), 8 (63), and 6 (69).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 0 (99), 7 (90), and 6 (76).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (91), 8 (88), and 6 (75).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (79), 2 (75), and 1 (74).

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (since Agent 2 values it the most).
- Assign item 7 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 6 to Agent 1 (since Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 6 after Agents 0 and 2 have been allocated items).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 8 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1 (as it hasn't been given a high-value item yet).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4, 6],
    "2": [0, 7],
    "3": [5, 8],
    "4": [3]
}
```
