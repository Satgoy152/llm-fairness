Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  71  46  62  88  80   4  84  30  53
1  60   9  15   9  31  14  42  11  46
2  85  81  26  54  83  95  34  53   0
3  55  82  13  54  21  38   0  79  31
4  96  72  88  77  82  52  46  46   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items based on the preferences or valuations each agent has for the items, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. List the items and their values for each agent.
2. Try to allocate items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item, while ensuring each agent receives an item if possible.
3. Ensure that each item is assigned to only one agent, and all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (96)
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (82)
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 4 (88)
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (88)
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (83)
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (95)
- **Item 6**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (84)
- **Item 7**: Highest valuation by Agent 3 (79)
- **Item 8**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (53)

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item. If one agent doesn't receive any items, we'll adjust accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 6, 8
- Agent 1: No items assigned yet
- Agent 2: Items 4, 5
- Agent 3: Items 1, 7
- Agent 4: Items 0, 2

Agent 1 has no items, so let's redistribute from agents with more than one item:

- Remove Item 8 from Agent 0 and assign it to Agent 1. 

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.
