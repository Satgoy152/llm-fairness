Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  74  14  24  14  71  40  46  74  17
1  17  50  34  65  74  55  16  30  37
2   6  67  14  19  88   7  21  94  97
3  71  88  68  96  22  85  48  46  77
4  95  88  21  16  27  40  33  79  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each item is given to exactly one agent. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Let's allocate the items based on this strategy:

1. Look at each item and assign it to the agent that values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most (95).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (67).
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most (68).
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (96).
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most (88).
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most (85).
- Item 6: Agent 0 values it the most (46).
- Item 7: Agent 2 values it the most (94).
- Item 8: Agent 2 values it the most (97).

Now, let's adjust to ensure all agents get at least one item:

- Agent 0 currently has no items. Let's give them item 6, which they value.
- Agent 1 currently has no items. Let's give them item 1, which they value second highest after Agent 2.

The adjusted allocation is:

- Agent 0: [6]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [4, 7, 8]
- Agent 3: [2, 3, 5]
- Agent 4: [0]

These allocations ensure that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [6],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 7, 8],
    "3": [2, 3, 5],
    "4": [0]
}
```
