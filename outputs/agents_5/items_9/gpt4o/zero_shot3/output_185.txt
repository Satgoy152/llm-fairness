Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  30  38  30  40  33  53  54  77
1   8  28  89  30  62  85   0  12  53
2  31  58  36  20  19  86  56  21  54
3  47  44  64  31  95  92  95  98  98
4  97  54  85  94  63  44  36  81  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider using a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of items. Given the constraints that each agent should receive an integer number of items, and all items must be allocated, we'll use a greedy approach to distribute the items.

Let's begin by determining a fair allocation of the items among the agents.

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent to understand how highly they value the items overall.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent gets a fair share.
3. Check if any agent has received more or fewer items than necessary, and adjust accordingly to balance the allocation.

Based on the table provided, let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the highest (97).
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest (58).
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the highest (89).
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the highest (94).
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the highest (95).
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the highest (86).
- Item 6: Agent 3 values it the highest (95).
- Item 7: Agent 3 values it the highest (98).
- Item 8: Agent 3 values it the highest (98).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0 currently has no items. Re-evaluate to ensure fair allocation:
  - Agent 0 could take item 0 from Agent 4 (losing the least value overall).

After rebalancing:

- Agent 0: Items [0]
- Agent 1: Items [2]
- Agent 2: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 3: Items [6, 7, 8]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 4]

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [6, 7, 8],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent has an integer number of items, all items are distributed, and the allocation is as fair as possible based on the agents' valuations.
