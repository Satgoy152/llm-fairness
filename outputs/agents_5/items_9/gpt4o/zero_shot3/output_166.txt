Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  17   4  96  53  53  62  78  71  98
1  90  43  62   1  96  70  70  20  56
2  44  16  69  82  11   3  64  87  88
3  51  52  48  45  24  69   6  17  10
4  65  20  31  25  24  12  22  45   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 9 items are distributed. A common approach to achieve fairness is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from their allocated items.

We'll start by assigning items to the agents based on their highest valuations for those items. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Assign item 8 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it highest at 98.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it highest at 96.
3. Assign item 7 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it highest at 87.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it highest at 69.
5. Assign item 0 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it second highest at 90.
6. Assign item 2 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it second highest at 96.
7. Assign item 3 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it second highest at 82.
8. Assign item 6 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it third highest at 78.
9. Assign item 1 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it second highest at 52.

This allocation attempts to give each agent a fair share based on their valuations. Here's the final JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 6, 8],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3, 7],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 9 items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on maximizing their valuations.
