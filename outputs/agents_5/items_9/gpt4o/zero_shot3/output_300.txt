Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  12  88  90  46  40  74  38   4  82
1  22  53  13  85  47  47   5  41  67
2   3  13   9   7  79  59  88  71   8
3  72  76  56  65  13  29   7  48   6
4  83  61  70  65  56  90  58  69  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider distributing the items such that each agent receives items of relatively high value to them, while ensuring all items are allocated.

One potential approach is to allocate items in a way that maximizes the total value for each agent. Below is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Items: 1, 2, 8
   - Total Value: 88 + 90 + 82 = 260

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Items: 3
   - Total Value: 85

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Items: 5, 6
   - Total Value: 59 + 88 = 147

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Items: 0
   - Total Value: 72

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Items: 4, 7
   - Total Value: 56 + 69 = 125

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2, 8],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations, and all 9 items are allocated.
