Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  15  56  37  59  91  70  66  42  60
1  64  46   9  70  24  13  39  47  28
2  43  33  42  88   6  93  99  74  40
3  83  49  18  31  31  55  50  51  53
4  78  57  46  67  87  16  13  97   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while ensuring all items are allocated.

To achieve this, we can use a simple algorithm where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. After assigning all items, we ensure that each agent receives at least one item by adjusting allocations if necessary, while maintaining overall fairness.

Here's how the allocation can be done based on the provided valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 83 by agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 56 by agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 46 by agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 88 by agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 91 by agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 93 by agent 2.
7. **Item 6**: Highest value is 99 by agent 2.
8. **Item 7**: Highest value is 97 by agent 4.
9. **Item 8**: Highest value is 60 by agent 0.

Now, allocating based on the above highest values:

- Agent 0 receives items 1, 4, and 8.
- Agent 1 receives no items initially.
- Agent 2 receives items 3, 5, and 6.
- Agent 3 receives item 0.
- Agent 4 receives items 2 and 7.

To ensure every agent has at least one item, we can re-allocate:

- Move item 8 from agent 0 to agent 1 to ensure agent 1 has an item.

The final allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [8],
    "2": [3, 5, 6],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures all agents have at least one item, and all items are allocated.
