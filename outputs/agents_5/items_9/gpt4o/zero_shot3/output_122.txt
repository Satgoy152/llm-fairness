Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49   2  69  84  60  13  41  49  70
1  84  89  75  41  61   0  47  43   7
2  89  91  40  31  98  71  85  51  87
3  20  42  66   3  36  35  97  69  96
4  60  39  71  12   4  92  28   7  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction while ensuring every item is allocated and each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the highest valuations, agent 0 has a high valuation for items 3 and 2. Assign these items to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1. Assign item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4 and 8. Assign these items to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 6 and 7 highly. Assign these items to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Lastly, agent 4 can be assigned items 5 and 0, as they have relatively higher valuations for these compared to other unallocated items.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 8],
    "3": [6, 7],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent a share of the items, ensuring that each item is allocated once, while trying to maximize the total valuation for each agent.
