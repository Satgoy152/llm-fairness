Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  67  20  84  77  88  29  40  54  74
1  62  83   4  14  89  75  83  78  98
2  47  47  49  41   6  89   6  48  34
3  14  77  86  21  26   1  42  16  45
4  66  73  55  25  13   5  19   4  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is allocated to exactly one agent. We'll try to distribute the items based on the highest value each agent has for the items.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 0, 2, and 4.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 8.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3.
5. Agent 4 can take items 6 and 7, which are left over.

Now, let's represent this allocation in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [1, 8],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [6, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, each agent has an integer number of items, and all 9 items are allocated.
