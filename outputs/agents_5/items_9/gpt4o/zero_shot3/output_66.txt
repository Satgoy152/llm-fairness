Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87   2  57  78  71  28  55  24  27
1  51  46  44  81  60   0   2  36  33
2  50  11  57  95  68  49  15  33  73
3  96  87  80  44  77  18  26  51  39
4  79  23  92  96   1  25  78  37  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 0 the highest (87). We allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has a high value for item 3 (81). We allocate item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 has the highest value for item 3 (95), but since it is already allocated, we look at their next highest value for item 2 (57). We allocate item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (96), but since it is already allocated, we look at the next highest valued item, which is item 1 (87). We allocate item 1 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 has the highest values for items 3 and 0 (96 and 79 respectively), but these are already allocated. The next highest valued items are item 2 (92), which is already allocated, and item 6 (78). We allocate item 6 to agent 4.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items 4, 5, 7, and 8.

6. **Agent 0**: We allocate item 7 (24) and item 8 (27) to agent 0, as they have relatively lower valuations for these items.

7. **Agent 1**: We allocate item 4 (60) to agent 1, as it is the highest unallocated item for them.

8. **Agent 2**: We allocate item 5 (49) to agent 2, as it is the highest unallocated item for them.

This ensures all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 7, 8],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [6]
}
```
