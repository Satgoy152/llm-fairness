Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  98  49  73  52   3  93  15  97  63
1  31  79  80  16  20  37  40   2  82
2  71  45  98  55   7  11  76  93  52
3  69  86  36   5  50   2  42  83  48
4  61   6  23  40  76  58  51  43   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and that the valuations are distributed in a way that each agent is reasonably satisfied with the allocation. A common approach is to maximize the sum of the valuations for the items each agent receives, while also considering that each agent should receive at least one item if possible.

Let's try to allocate items based on maximizing the agents' valuations for their assigned items:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 0 (98) and 5 (93).
2. Agent 1 values item 2 (80) and item 8 (82).
3. Agent 2 values item 2 (98) and item 7 (93).
4. Agent 3 values item 1 (86) and item 7 (83).
5. Agent 4 values item 4 (76).

We'll try to distribute the remaining items fairly among the agents, keeping in mind their next best valuations:

- Agent 0 also values item 7 (97).
- Agent 2 also values items 6 (76).
- Agent 3 also values item 3 (5).
- Agent 4 also values items 5 (58).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: 0, 5
- **Agent 1**: 2, 8
- **Agent 2**: 6
- **Agent 3**: 1, 7
- **Agent 4**: 3, 4

This allocation ensures that each agent gets a reasonable share of items, based on their valuations, and that all 9 items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [6],
    "3": [1, 7],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
