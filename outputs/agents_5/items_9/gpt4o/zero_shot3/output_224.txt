Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  11  13  64  59  10  33  32  55  32
1  52   1  96  60  72  96  69   5  17
2  93  12  81  28  36  88  98   5  97
3  42   1  77  36  21  10  81  17  52
4  26  99  54  54  69  96  34  57  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52  1 96 60 72 96 69  5 17]
 [93 12 81 28 36 88 98  5 97]
 [42  1 77 36 21 10 81 17 52]
 [26 99 54 54 69 96 34 57 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the 9 items to the 5 agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives. Since each agent should get at least one item, we can start by assigning the highest valued item for each agent. Then, we can distribute the remaining items to balance the valuations as much as possible.

Based on the valuation table, let's make an allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 highest at 64.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 highest at 96, but it’s already taken by Agent 0, so next highest is item 5 at 96.
3. Agent 2 values item 6 highest at 98.
4. Agent 3 values item 6 highest at 81, but it’s already taken by Agent 2, so next highest is item 2 at 77.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 highest at 99.

Now, distribute the rest to balance the allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 3]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [6, 8]
- Agent 3: [7]
- Agent 4: [0, 1, 4]

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [6, 8],
    "3": [7],
    "4": [0, 1, 4]
}
```
