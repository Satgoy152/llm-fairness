Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  81  65  31  42  47  55  37  52  68
1  22  74  92  42  97  11  90  56  40
2  80  57  54   5  53  53  21   8  80
3   1  15  50  33  19   7  39  68  79
4   6  34  18  85  99  61  29  18  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we'll aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Best items based on valuation: Item 0 (81), Item 8 (68)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Best items based on valuation: Item 4 (97), Item 2 (92)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Best items based on valuation: Item 0 (80), Item 8 (80)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Best items based on valuation: Item 8 (79), Item 7 (68)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Best items based on valuation: Item 4 (99), Item 3 (85)

To ensure that each agent gets items, we need to distribute them while maximizing satisfaction and ensuring each item is allocated only once:

Here's a possible fair allocation based on the values:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 5]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Items [1]
- Agent 3: Items [7, 8]
- Agent 4: Items [3, 6]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and attempts to maximize satisfaction based on the given valuations.

Now, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [7, 8],
    "4": [3, 6]
}
```
