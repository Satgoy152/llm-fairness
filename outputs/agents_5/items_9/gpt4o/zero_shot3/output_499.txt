Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  42  70  79  58  57  17  98  53  37
1  14  89  94  13  44  27  55  14  90
2   0  51  78  18  87   1  91  33  40
3  66  30  68  31  32  33  75  57  94
4  12  43  42  19  45  33  23  65  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. However, since there are five agents and only nine items, some agents will inevitably receive fewer items or none at all.

Let's start by assigning the items to the agents based on the highest valuation:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 66 by agent 3.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 89 by agent 1.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 94 by agent 1.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 58 by agent 0.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 87 by agent 2.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 33 by agents 3 and 4 (choose agent 3 for balance).
7. Item 6: Highest value is 98 by agent 0.
8. Item 7: Highest value is 65 by agent 4.
9. Item 8: Highest value is 94 by agent 3.

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and make adjustments for fairness:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 6]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 2]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: Items [0, 5, 8]
- Agent 4: Item [7]

The allocations are balanced with all items assigned, and agent 2 gets at least one item with the highest value they provided. Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 6],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 5, 8],
    "4": [7]
}
```
