Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  49  26  19  82  73  72  39  54  71
1  96  12  12  25  12  88  62  63  41
2  90  50  79  91  45  25  43  33  27
3  83  34  20   7  66  99  67  57  17
4  67   9  73  24  20  59  45  72  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given there are 9 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive 1 item, and some will receive 2 items.

Let's proceed with the allocation based on maximizing the value for each agent:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 3 (82) and 4 (73).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest values are for items 0 (96) and 5 (88).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values are for items 3 (91) and 2 (79), but item 3 is already allocated, so 2 and 0.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest values are for items 5 (99) and 6 (67), but item 5 is already allocated, so 6 and 4.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest values are for items 7 (72) and 8 (40).

Now, let's adjust the allocations to ensure all items are assigned:

- Agent 0 gets items [3, 4]
- Agent 1 gets items [0, 5]
- Agent 2 gets items [2]
- Agent 3 gets items [6]
- Agent 4 gets items [7, 8]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [7, 8]
}
```
