Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  77  95  20  92  23  19  62  42  90
1  11  23  30  61  57  12  90   5  37
2   2  75  13  64  78  92  85  10  79
3  22  60  72   4  94  54  36  49  26
4  43   4  91  35  38  60  79  51  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed and each agent receives an integer count of items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Items 1 (95), 3 (92), 0 (77), 8 (90)
   - Allocate item 1 (95)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest values: Item 6 (90), 3 (61), 4 (57)
   - Allocate item 6 (90)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values: Item 5 (92), 4 (78), 8 (79)
   - Allocate item 5 (92)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values: Item 4 (94), 2 (72), 1 (60)
   - Allocate item 4 (94)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest values: Item 2 (91), 8 (84), 6 (79)
   - Allocate items 2 (91), 8 (84)

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items (0, 3, 7):

6. **Agent 0**: 
   - Allocate item 0 (77) (since it's highly valued by agent 0)

7. **Agent 3**: 
   - Allocate item 3 (4) (although not as valuable, to ensure fairness in the number of items)

8. **Agent 4**: 
   - Allocate item 7 (51) (since agent 4 has a preference for item 7 after others)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives a fair share of items based on their valuations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 0],
    "1": [6],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [2, 8, 7]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 9 items among the 5 agents with each receiving at least one item.
