Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  70  53  58  28  77  15  54   0  75
1  17  17  62  91  45  59  18  10  24
2   4  81  94  85  28  26  65  53  94
3   0   8   9  98  11   1  86  70  97
4  67  84  89  13  23  99  93  73  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives. One approach is to iteratively assign the highest valued item for each agent, ensuring each item is only assigned once, until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 77).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 1 (value 91).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 2 (value 94).
4. Assign item 6 to agent 3 (value 86).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 4 (value 99).

After assigning one item to each agent based on their highest valuations, we continue to allocate the remaining items:

6. Assign item 8 to agent 3 (value 97).
7. Assign item 0 to agent 4 (value 67).
8. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 81).
9. Assign item 7 to agent 4 (value 73).

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [6, 8],
    "4": [5, 0, 7]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.
