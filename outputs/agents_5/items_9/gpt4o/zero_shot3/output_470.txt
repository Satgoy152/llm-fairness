Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  87  40  80  49  54  61  67  35  88
1  43  28  66  94  73  89  17  77  98
2  35  58  48  87  76  78  70  11  60
3   2  46  61  28  11  79  66  29  15
4  30  44   7  44  37  76  48  43  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuation each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items so that each agent receives items they value highly, if possible. We also want to ensure that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items (since there are 5 agents and 9 items, most agents will get 2 items, with one agent getting 1 item).

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuations: 88 (Item 8), 87 (Item 0), 80 (Item 2)
   - Allocate items: [0, 8]

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: 98 (Item 8), 94 (Item 3), 89 (Item 5)
   - Allocate items: [3, 5]

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: 87 (Item 3), 78 (Item 5), 76 (Item 4)
   - Allocate items: [4, 2]

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: 79 (Item 5), 66 (Item 6), 61 (Item 2)
   - Allocate items: [6]

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: 76 (Item 5), 49 (Item 8), 48 (Item 6)
   - Allocate items: [1, 7]

The allocations are based on the highest available valuation for each agent, ensuring that each agent receives items they value significantly if possible. The allocation is done while respecting the constraint of allocating all 9 items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 8],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [6],
    "4": [1, 7]
}
```
