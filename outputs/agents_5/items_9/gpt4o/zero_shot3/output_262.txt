Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 9 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
0  61  83   6  49  44  40  86  82  18
1  60  33  61  37  19  49  39  12  86
2  66   6  85  88  88  67  97  58  10
3  41  91  56  11  71  62  11  82  98
4   6  66  70   9  10  68   5  29  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 9 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value 61
   - Item 5: Value 40
   - Total value for Agent 0: 101

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2: Value 61
   - Item 8: Value 86
   - Total value for Agent 1: 147

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 3: Value 88
   - Total value for Agent 2: 88

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 4: Value 71
   - Item 7: Value 82
   - Total value for Agent 3: 153

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 1: Value 66
   - Item 6: Value 5
   - Total value for Agent 4: 71

This distribution ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share according to their valuations. Now, let's represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2, 8],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 7],
    "4": [1, 6]
}
```

This allocation satisfies the requirement of allocating exactly 9 items, with each agent receiving at least one item.
