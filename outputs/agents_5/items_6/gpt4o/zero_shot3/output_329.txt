Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77   3  22  99   4  22
1  53  99  54  43  23  39
2  74  60  11  98  75  70
3  65  29  27  20  81  76
4  49  16  70  14  31  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One common approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 99.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most at 99.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the second most after agent 0, but it's already taken. Therefore, assign item 5 to agent 2, which they value at 70.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the most at 81.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the most at 70.
6. Finally, item 0 is left and is valued the most by agent 0 at 77.

After making these decisions, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This ensures that each item is allocated, and each agent has a fair share based on their valuations.
