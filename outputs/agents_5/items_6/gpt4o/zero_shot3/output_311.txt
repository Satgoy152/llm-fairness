Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  66  10  34   3  97
1  87  65  35  80  77  20
2  69  96  10  13  30  52
3  78  43  38  99  48  94
4  40  11   7  90  44  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value received by each agent. One common method is to use a greedy algorithm that iteratively assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while keeping track of the number of items each agent receives to ensure each agent gets at least one item.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 87.
   
2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 2 values it the highest at 96.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 38.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 99.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 77.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 97.

Now, check to ensure each agent has at least one item. This allocation satisfies that condition:

- Agent 0: 1 item (Item 5)
- Agent 1: 2 items (Items 0, 4)
- Agent 2: 1 item (Item 1)
- Agent 3: 2 items (Items 2, 3)
- Agent 4: 0 items (needs to be adjusted)

Since Agent 4 has no items, we'll need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness. We'll swap an item from an agent with more than one item to Agent 4. 

Adjustments:
- Swap Item 4 from Agent 1 to Agent 4 to ensure fairness.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This ensures that all agents have received at least one item, and all items have been allocated.
