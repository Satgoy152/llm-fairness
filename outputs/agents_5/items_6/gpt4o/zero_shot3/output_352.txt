Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  53  80   1  97  78
1  46  20  52  40  76  45
2  47  83  67  34  47  21
3  86  79   5   3  93  49
4  25  71  59  30  25  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets from their allocated items. One common method to achieve this is by using a form of the "maximum weight matching" algorithm in a bipartite graph, where one set of nodes represent agents and the other set represent items, with edges weighted by the valuations.

Let's try to allocate the items such that the total valuation is maximized:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is for Item 4 (97).
2. **Agent 1**: After allocating Item 4 to Agent 0, the next highest valuation for Agent 1 is for Item 0 (46).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is for Item 1 (83).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is for Item 0 (86), but since it's taken by Agent 1, the next highest is Item 4 (93) but it's already taken, so Item 1 (79) is chosen.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is for Item 5 (85).

Now, let’s ensure all items are allocated:

- **Item 2 and 3** are left unallocated, and they have relatively lower valuations across the board. Assign Item 2 to Agent 0 since they have the highest valuation for it and Item 3 to Agent 1 for the same reason.

Here's the allocation based on maximizing individual valuations while ensuring all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 2],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent’s allocation maximizes their satisfaction based on their respective valuations.
