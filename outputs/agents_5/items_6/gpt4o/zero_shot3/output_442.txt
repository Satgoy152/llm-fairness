Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  97  85  90  41   4
1  45  46  35  72  97  92
2  53  77   7   9  22  35
3  30  67  47  35  32  43
4  35   3  81  75  97  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 97 85 90 41  4]
 [45 46 35 72 97 92]
 [53 77  7  9 22 35]
 [30 67 47 35 32 43]
 [35  3 81 75 97 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given the table of valuations, one approach is to allocate items to the agents who value them the most. Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 84.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values it the most at 97.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 4 values it the most at 81.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most at 90.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most at 92.

Let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 receives items 0, 1, and 3.
- Agent 1 receives items 4 and 5.
- Agent 4 receives item 2.
- Agents 2 and 3 receive no items.

Now, let's put the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2]
}
```
