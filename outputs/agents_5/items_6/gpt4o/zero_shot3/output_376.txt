Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  52  82  51  52  75
1  82  33  51  33  86  10
2  98  33  58  78   3  89
3  57  44  31  22  42  88
4  79  91  53   9  17  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives items based on their valuations, aiming for the highest possible satisfaction. This can be achieved by a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item:

1. List each item's value to each agent.
2. Assign the item to the agent with the highest value for that item.
3. Ensure each agent ends up with at least one item, if possible.

Let's work through the allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value is 98 (Agent 2)
- Item 1: Highest value is 91 (Agent 4)
- Item 2: Highest value is 82 (Agent 0)
- Item 3: Highest value is 78 (Agent 2)
- Item 4: Highest value is 86 (Agent 1)
- Item 5: Highest value is 95 (Agent 4)

After this initial allocation, let's check:

- Agent 0 has item 2
- Agent 1 has item 4
- Agent 2 has items 0 and 3
- Agent 3 has no items
- Agent 4 has items 1 and 5

Agent 3 doesn't have any items, and we need to ensure that each agent gets at least one item. Let's adjust the allocation slightly to give Agent 3 an item:

Since Agent 3 has a relatively high valuation for item 5, we can reallocate item 5 from Agent 4 to Agent 3. 

Now, the adjusted allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [0, 3]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [1]

This ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Let's present the final allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
