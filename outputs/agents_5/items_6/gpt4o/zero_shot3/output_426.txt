Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  43  38  93  38   0
1  93  50   8   5  22  81
2  95   4  79  83  45  29
3  78  29  38  67  56  11
4  74  58  81  63  93  75

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent that values it the most until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the items and assign them to the agents:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 2 (value = 95).

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 4 (value = 58).

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 4 (value = 81).

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 0 (value = 93).

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 4 (value = 93).

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest valuation is by agent 1 (value = 81).

Based on the above allocations, agent 4 received three items which might not be fair. We can try to reallocate to ensure fairness, ensuring that each agent gets a chance to receive at least one item if possible. Let's adjust the allocation:

- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (second highest valuation after agent 4).
- Assign item 2 to agent 3 (second highest valuation after agent 4).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 (second highest valuation after agent 4).

After adjustment:

- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets items 4 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 3 gets item 2.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.

This allocation ensures that items are distributed fairly based on valuation and each agent receives at least one item.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
