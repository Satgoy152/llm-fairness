Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  45  14  76  91   5
1  82  21  18   0  39  67
2  35  82  67  46  59  93
3  92  91  17  38  84  79
4  62  68  23  68  57  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [62 68 23 68 57 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is assigned and each agent can receive zero or more items.

Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuations are for items 4 (91) and 3 (76).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuations are for items 0 (82) and 5 (67).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuations are for items 5 (93) and 1 (82).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuations are for items 0 (92) and 1 (91).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuations are for items 1 (68) and 3 (68).

By reviewing these preferences and ensuring no item is assigned more than once, I will allocate the items such that the total valuation is maximized across all agents.

### Allocation Plan:
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent's highest-valued items are considered.

### Final Allocations in JSON Format:
```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```
This configuration ensures all items are allocated, and agents receive items they value highly, considering the constraints.
