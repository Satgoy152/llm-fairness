Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  26  93  47  65  48
1  66   8  13  35   6  80
2  96  57  67  66  45  50
3  85  21  79  29  84  42
4  28  87  71  74  19  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66  8 13 35  6 80]

 [28 87 71 74 19 99]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of allocated items is equal to 6. We'll attempt to allocate the items based on maximizing the total value each agent derives from the items they receive.

Given the table of valuations:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  26  93  47  65  48
1  66   8  13  35   6  80
2  96  57  67  66  45  50
3  85  21  79  29  84  42
4  28  87  71  74  19  99
```

We can allocate the items as follows to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0 gets item 2 (value = 93)
- Agent 1 gets item 5 (value = 80)
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value = 96)
- Agent 3 gets item 4 (value = 84)
- Agent 4 gets items 1 and 3 (total value = 87 + 74 = 161)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 6 items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```
