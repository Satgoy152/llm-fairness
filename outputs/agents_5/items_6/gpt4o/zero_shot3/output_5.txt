Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  24  81  73  45   1
1  94  92  55  85  65  94
2  70  57  44  29  81   2
3   5  78  54  93  86  69
4  10  21  73  20  71  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 24 81 73 45  1]
 [94 92 55 85 65 94]
 [70 57 44 29 81  2]
 [ 5 78 54 93 86 69]
 [10 21 73 20 71 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we should consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. However, since we have more agents than items, some agents may end up with no items. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0:** High valuation for item 0 (value = 93)
2. **Agent 1:** High valuation for item 5 (value = 94)
3. **Agent 2:** High valuation for item 4 (value = 81)
4. **Agent 3:** High valuation for item 3 (value = 93)
5. **Agent 4:** High valuation for item 2 (value = 73)

Now, we have allocated 5 items and need to allocate one more. We will consider the remaining unallocated items and their values for the remaining agents. 

The remaining unallocated item is item 1, and we can allocate it to the agent with the highest remaining valuation for this item:

- **Agent 1:** Value for item 1 = 92 (highest valuation for this item)

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
