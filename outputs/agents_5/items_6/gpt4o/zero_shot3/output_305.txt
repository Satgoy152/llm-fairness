Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  25  11  48  90  35
1  35  70  80  64  76  19
2  28  22  33  75  45  41
3  76  12  61  89  80  10
4  53   9  39  94  80  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering each agent's valuation for the items. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item or as close to fair distribution as possible.

Let's evaluate each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0**: The valuations are [51, 35, 28, 76, 53]. Agent 3 values it the most (76).
2. **Item 1**: The valuations are [25, 70, 22, 12, 9]. Agent 1 values it the most (70).
3. **Item 2**: The valuations are [11, 80, 33, 61, 39]. Agent 1 values it the most (80).
4. **Item 3**: The valuations are [48, 64, 75, 89, 94]. Agent 4 values it the most (94).
5. **Item 4**: The valuations are [90, 76, 45, 80, 80]. Agent 0 values it the most (90).
6. **Item 5**: The valuations are [35, 19, 41, 10, 31]. Agent 2 values it the most (41).

Now we can allocate the items based on these preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item goes to an agent who values it highly, and each agent receives at least one item, except for agent 2 who receives the last item based on remaining preference.
