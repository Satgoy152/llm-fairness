Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  57  92   8  83  36
1  93  43  98  43  96  85
2  85  25  61  86  30   6
3   7   9  36  46  61  75
4  26  82  58  55  83  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we'll aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated.

Let's evaluate each agent's highest-valued items and try to assign items based on these valuations to achieve a fair distribution. We'll consider each agent's top preferences and make sure no item is given to more than one agent.

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (92), Item 4 (83), Item 0 (80)

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (98), Item 4 (96), Item 5 (85)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (86), Item 0 (85), Item 2 (61)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 5 (75), Item 4 (61), Item 3 (46)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (82), Item 4 (83), Item 3 (55)

A fair allocation can look like this:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 2, Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 1

Each agent receives items according to their high valuations while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
