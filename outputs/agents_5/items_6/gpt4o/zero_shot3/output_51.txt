Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  87  71  76  15  38
1  41  89   9   3  83  97
2  99  67  22  87  67  25
3   5  60  29  91  64  29
4  54  38  68   5   6  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation that each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and that all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This will ensure that each item is initially given to the agent who places the highest value on it.

2. **Adjust for Fair Allocation:** Since we have 6 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more than one item. We'll need to adjust the allocation so that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed.

3. **Reassign Items if Necessary:** If an agent ends up with no items, we will reassign items by considering the next highest valuation for some items to ensure that no agent is left without any item.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most at 99.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most at 89.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most at 71.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 91.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 83.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.

After this initial assignment, we have:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1, 4, 5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: []

Agent 4 currently has no items, so we need to adjust.

Let's reassign item 4 from Agent 1 to Agent 4 since Agent 4 values item 4 the next highest after Agent 1. This will ensure Agent 4 gets at least one item.

Now, the allocation will be:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1, 5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4]

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
