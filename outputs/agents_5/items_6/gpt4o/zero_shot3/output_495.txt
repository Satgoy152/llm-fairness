Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  39  69  41  67  52
1  48  97  69  81  41  24
2   2  90  26  68  61  53
3  68  16  39  34  15  18
4  70  75  42  90  52  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated, we can use a simple method to maximize total valuation. This approach involves giving each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's determine the allocations:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 4 (value 70).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 1 (value 97).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0 (value 69).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 4 (value 90).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 0 (value 67).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 2 (value 53).

Now, we assign the items to the agents based on these valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Items 0, 3

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```
