Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  39  36  51  52  14
1  51  75  86  39   4  60
2  99  62  86  27  34  32
3  82  47  37  71  76  61
4  47  36  39  56  54  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [51 75 86 39  4 60]
 [99 62 86 27 34 32]
 [82 47 37 71 76 61]
 [47 36 39 56 54 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy such as maximizing the total valuation each agent receives or ensuring an equitable distribution of total valuations. Given the table, we'll aim to distribute items so that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 99).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 75).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 86).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 71).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 3 (value 76).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 4 (value 81).

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation would look in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation distributes all six items while maximizing the total value each agent receives. Agent 0, in this case, does not receive an item as their valuations are generally lower compared to others for all items.
