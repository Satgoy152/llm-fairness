Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  53  83  89  79  47
1  53  39  62  61  47  93
2  53  76  16  25  45  24
3  59  56  88  25  41  94
4  69  95  85  47   0  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed. This is a variation of the assignment problem, which can be solved using an algorithm like the Hungarian method. However, for simplicity, let's use a heuristic approach to allocate the items:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for any item and try to allocate items based on these preferences.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item.
3. Make sure all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 and 3 at 89 each, which is the highest among their options.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 93.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 1 at 76.
- Agent 3 values item 5 at 94, but since item 5 is already allocated to agent 1, we can assign item 2, which they value at 88.
- Agent 4 values item 1 at 95, which is the highest among all agents, but since item 1 is already allocated to agent 2, we assign item 4, which they value at 0.

Let's assign the items to the agents based on these considerations:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Items 3 and 4

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
