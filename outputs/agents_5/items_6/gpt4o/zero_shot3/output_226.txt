Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  82  81  76   3  61
1  75   8   3  54  80  71
2  19  25  10   2  54  29
3  71  50  47  16  97  31
4   7  79  90  78  16  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should try to maximize each agent's satisfaction by giving them items they value highly, while ensuring that all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item if possible. 

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 highly, but since it's already allocated, we look at their next highest which is item 5, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly, but since it's already allocated, we look at their next highest, which is item 0, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 highly, so we allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Now we look at the remaining unallocated item, which is item 3. We allocate this to Agent 1, who values it next highest after item 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items they value, and all items are allocated. The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
