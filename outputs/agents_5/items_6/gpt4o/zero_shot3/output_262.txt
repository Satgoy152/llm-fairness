Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30   7   7  60   9  30
1  33  16  16  45  10  60
2   4  58  51  62  43  87
3  68  23  42  14  60  41
4  81  80   2  32  97  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider each agent's valuation for each item and attempt to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Let's go through the process step by step:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value items are 3 (60), 0 (30), and 5 (30).

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value items are 5 (60), 0 (33), and 3 (45).

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value items are 5 (87), 3 (62), and 1 (58).

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value items are 0 (68), 4 (60), and 2 (42).

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value items are 4 (97), 0 (81), and 1 (80).

Based on these valuations, we can make a tentative allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (highest value for Agent 0)
- **Agent 1**: Item 5 (highest value for Agent 1)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (next highest available value for Agent 2)
- **Agent 3**: Item 0 (highest value for Agent 3)
- **Agent 4**: Items 1 and 4 (highest value for Agent 4)

Now, let's ensure each item is allocated and each agent has either one or no item:

- Item 0 is allocated to Agent 3.
- Item 1 is allocated to Agent 4.
- Item 2 is allocated to Agent 2.
- Item 3 is allocated to Agent 0.
- Item 4 is allocated to Agent 4.
- Item 5 is allocated to Agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
