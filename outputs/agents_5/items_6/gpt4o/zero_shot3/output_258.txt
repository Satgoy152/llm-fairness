Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  90  64  68  69  67
1  50  21  16  12  12   4
2  99  92  68  49  68  77
3  74  90  83  30  74  75
4  54  95  19  34   5  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 9 90 64 68 69 67]
 [50 21 16 12 12  4]
 [99 92 68 49 68 77]

 [54 95 19 34  5 15]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the item-by-item allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from Agent 2 (99).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from Agent 4 (95).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from Agent 3 (83).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from Agent 0 (68).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from Agent 0 (69).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is from Agent 2 (77).

However, this allocation gives Agent 0 two items, which is fine as long as the total number of items allocated is six. Now let's compile this into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all six items are allocated.
