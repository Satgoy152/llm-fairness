Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  18  82  45  58  59
1  63  70  54  75   2  69
2  42  48  11  44  20  56
3  45  78  95   3  92  76
4  63  42  73   2  23  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a heuristic approach to try and maximize the total value for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's how we could do it:

1. **Agent 3:** They value item 2 the highest at 95. Assign item 2 to agent 3.
2. **Agent 1:** They value item 3 the highest at 75. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 0:** They value item 2 the highest, but itâ€™s already taken. Their next best is item 5 at 59. Assign item 5 to agent 0.
4. **Agent 2:** Their highest valued remaining item is item 1 at 48. Assign item 1 to agent 2.
5. **Agent 4:** Their highest valued remaining item is item 0 at 63. Assign item 0 to agent 4.
6. **Agent 0:** Now, for the remaining agent with the highest value for the remaining item (item 4), assign it to agent 0 who values it at 58.

This ensures each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
