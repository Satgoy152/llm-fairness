Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  50  91   9  67  92
1  68  92  13  26  78  80
2  54  50  86  35  42   3
3  54  19  82  61  99  89
4  98  49  75  62   1  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes individual agents' valuations while ensuring a balanced distribution. Given the constraints, here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 5.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 2, but Agent 0 values it more, so Agent 2 can have item 3, which is still reasonably valued.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4.
5. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 0, but Agent 0 values it more, so Agent 4 can have the remaining item, 5, which Agent 0 also values highly.

Based on this approach, here is how the items can be allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, maximizing the total valuation based on each agent's preferences.
