Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  35  25  95  85   6
1  87  43  78  57  57  41
2   0  54  34  91  80  31
3  65  76  21  72  65  29
4  42  74  39  39  78  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total value of items each agent receives. One possible way to do this is to assign items to agents based on maximizing their valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, or balancing the total value each agent receives.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 3 and 4.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 3 values items 1 and 3 fairly well.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most.

To ensure fairness, we can distribute items to maximize each agent's highest valuation while trying to balance out the total values. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0 (value 95).
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 78).
3. Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (value 80).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 76).
5. Assign item 0 to Agent 4 (value 42).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (value 29).

This distribution aims to give each agent a favorable item or maximize the value they receive. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, with Agent 3 receiving two items to balance out the overall allocation.
