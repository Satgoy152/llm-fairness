Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  16  35  60  24  54
1  90  84  30  18  74  98
2  62  73  39  29  62  70
3  98  98  29  93  81  67
4  32  66   2  72   2   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items. The goal is to ensure that each agent receives items according to their preferences, while ensuring all items are distributed.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it at 98, which is the highest.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 also values it at 98, the highest again.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 35, which is the highest among all agents.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it at 60, the highest among all agents.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 74, which is the highest among all agents.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 98, the highest among all agents.

Now let's check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 2, 3
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Items 0, 1
- Agent 4: No items

This allocation ensures that each item goes to the agent who values it the most based on the given table, and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": []
}
```
