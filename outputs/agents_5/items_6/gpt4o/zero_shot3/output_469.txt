Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77   1  39  71  88  48
1  11  58  92  84  19  97
2  50   8  20  61  27  54
3  64  88  62  36  63   8
4  76  36  81  47  29  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One way to approach this problem is by using a greedy algorithm, assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. 

Let's evaluate each item and assign it to the agent who has the highest valuation for that item:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0: 77
   - Agent 1: 11
   - Agent 2: 50
   - Agent 3: 64
   - Agent 4: 76
   - Assign to Agent 0 (value: 77)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0: 1
   - Agent 1: 58
   - Agent 2: 8
   - Agent 3: 88
   - Agent 4: 36
   - Assign to Agent 3 (value: 88)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0: 39
   - Agent 1: 92
   - Agent 2: 20
   - Agent 3: 62
   - Agent 4: 81
   - Assign to Agent 1 (value: 92)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0: 71
   - Agent 1: 84
   - Agent 2: 61
   - Agent 3: 36
   - Agent 4: 47
   - Assign to Agent 1 (value: 84)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0: 88
   - Agent 1: 19
   - Agent 2: 27
   - Agent 3: 63
   - Agent 4: 29
   - Assign to Agent 0 (value: 88)

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0: 48
   - Agent 1: 97
   - Agent 2: 54
   - Agent 3: 8
   - Agent 4: 84
   - Assign to Agent 1 (value: 97)

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all items are allocated.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 3, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": []
}
```
