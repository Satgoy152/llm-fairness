Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  10  32   0  45  65  21
1  21   6  14  44  40  70
2  92  22  49  24  72  55
3  63  87  52  18  83  72
4  87  17  64  24  30  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. We aim to assign items in such a way that agents receive items they highly value, whenever possible, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Assign highest valued items first:** Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. **Ensure fair distribution:** If an agent ends up with no item, consider reallocating the least valued item of the agent with the highest number of items to the agent with none.

Applying this approach to the given valuations:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 92 by Agent 2.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 87 by Agent 3.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 64 by Agent 4.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 45 by Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 83 by Agent 3.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 70 by Agent 1.

Resulting initial allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 1, 4
- Agent 4: Item 2

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. This allocation is fair given the high valuations each agent has for their assigned items.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
