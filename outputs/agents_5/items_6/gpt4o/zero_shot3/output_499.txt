Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  87  46  94  83  70
1  20  26  69  16   3  40
2  87  34   5  37  78  61
3  77   8  41   5  69  86
4  30  71  64  42  82  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's aim for a fair distribution by considering the valuations of each agent for the items.

1. Start by assigning one item to each agent based on their highest preference:
   - Agent 0: Item 3 (value 94)
   - Agent 1: Item 2 (value 69)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (value 87)
   - Agent 3: Item 5 (value 86)
   - Agent 4: Item 4 (value 82)

2. One item remains (Item 1). Assign it to the agent who values it most and has the least total value so far:
   - Agent 0 values Item 1 at 87, which is the highest among all agents who have received only one item.

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated, with one agent receiving two items as required.
