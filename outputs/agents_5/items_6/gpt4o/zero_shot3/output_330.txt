Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  46  30   7  36  37
1  90  42  92  42  54  84
2  63  27  57   0  85  50
3  11   2  28  54   3  62
4  68  48  14  24  40  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. There are different ways to achieve this, such as using the max-min fairness approach or maximizing the total value assigned to each agent.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that aims to maximize the value for each agent while ensuring fairness:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuations: 46 (Item 1), 37 (Item 5)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuations: 92 (Item 2), 90 (Item 0)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuations: 85 (Item 4), 63 (Item 0)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: 62 (Item 5)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuation: 68 (Item 0), 56 (Item 5)

Considering the above, let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 2
- **Agent 2**: Item 4
- **Agent 3**: Item 3
- **Agent 4**: Items 0, 5

Now, let's put this into the JSON format as requested:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a substantial value from their allocated items while distributing all 6 items.
