Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68   7  12  51  80  61
1  13   6  22  52  30   3
2  71  66  10  92  48  85
3  75   9  98  25  94  85
4   4  45  84  81  65  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68  7 12 51 80 61]
 [13  6 22 52 30  3]
 [71 66 10 92 48 85]
 [75  9 98 25 94 85]
 [ 4 45 84 81 65 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, the goal is to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here’s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: They value item 4 the highest at 80.
2. **Agent 1**: They value item 3 the highest at 52.
3. **Agent 2**: They value item 3 the highest at 92, but it’s already taken. Their next best item is 5 at 85.
4. **Agent 3**: They value item 2 the highest at 98.
5. **Agent 4**: They value item 2 the highest at 84, but it’s already taken. Their next best item is 3 at 81, but it’s also taken. The next best available item is 1 at 45.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:
- **Agent 0**: Already has item 4, next best is item 0 at 68.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 5, next best is item 0 at 71.

This leaves no items left, as all have been allocated.

The allocation in JSON format would be:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

All items have been fairly allocated based on the agents' preferences and constraints.
