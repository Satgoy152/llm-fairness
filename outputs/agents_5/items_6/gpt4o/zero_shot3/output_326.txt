Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  17  58  54  40  43
1  34  10   6  58  57  18
2  59  72   7  71  75  72
3  13   0  26  98  74  65
4   3  12  49  53  26  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 5 17 58 54 40 43]
 [34 10  6 58 57 18]
 [59 72  7 71 75 72]

 [ 3 12 49 53 26 82]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's preferences and attempt to maximize overall satisfaction. We will ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all six items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table to distribute items considering each agent's highest preferences:

1. **Agent 0**: Prefers item 2 (58) and item 3 (54).
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers item 3 (58) and item 4 (57).
3. **Agent 2**: Prefers item 4 (75) and item 1 (72).
4. **Agent 3**: Prefers item 3 (98) and item 4 (74).
5. **Agent 4**: Prefers item 5 (82) and item 3 (53).

Considering the preferences and ensuring a fair distribution:

- **Agent 0**: Assign item 0 (5) and item 2 (58).
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3 (58).
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1 (72).
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 4 (74).
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 5 (82).

Now, let's format the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation respects each agent's preferences while ensuring all items are distributed.
