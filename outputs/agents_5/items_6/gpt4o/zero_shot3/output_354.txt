Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  50  37  64  41  19
1  74  77  75  43  91  99
2  73  34  61  21  81  61
3  10  52  79  59  17  98
4  18  86   9  20  22  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 50 37 64 41 19]
 [74 77 75 43 91 99]
 [73 34 61 21 81 61]
 [10 52 79 59 17 98]
 [18 86  9 20 22 91]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring all items are allocated. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items based on the highest valuation by any agent for that item. Hereâ€™s a potential allocation:

1. Assign items to agents based on the highest value for each item.
2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

The allocations based on the highest valuations are as follows:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (81).
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (86).
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (79).
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (64).
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (91).
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (99).

Now, let's ensure all agents who can receive an item get one and adjust for fairness:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 3
- Agent 1: Items 4, 5
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 1

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and tries to keep allocations fair based on valuations.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
