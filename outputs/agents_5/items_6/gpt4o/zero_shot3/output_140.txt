Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  78  51  48   6  15
1   0  42  15  39   8  58
2  64  56  75  34  49  71
3  62  88   5  14  68  36
4  16  97  54  69  64  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers the preferences of the agents based on their valuations. One approach is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations for each Agent**:
   - Agent 0: Highest valuation is 78 for item 1.
   - Agent 1: Highest valuation is 58 for item 5.
   - Agent 2: Highest valuation is 75 for item 2.
   - Agent 3: Highest valuation is 88 for item 1.
   - Agent 4: Highest valuation is 97 for item 1.

2. **Allocate Based on Highest Valuation**:
   - Since item 1 is the highest valued item for agents 0, 3, and 4, we'll consider who values it the most and allocate accordingly. Agent 4 values it the most with 97.
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

3. **Re-evaluate for Remaining Agents**:
   - Agent 0: Next highest is 51 for item 2.
   - Agent 1: Highest valuation remains 58 for item 5.
   - Agent 2: Highest valuation remains 75 for item 2.
   - Agent 3: Next highest is 68 for item 4.
   - Agent 4: Item 1 already allocated, next is 69 for item 3 but has an item already.

4. **Allocate the Remaining Items**:
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1 since no conflict and it was their highest.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3 since it's their next highest.

5. **Allocate Remaining Items**:
   - Agent 0 can get item 0 as it has the highest remaining value for them.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0 as well, since Agent 4 already has an item, and it maximizes Agent 0's allocation.

Finally, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed among the agents based on their valuations.
