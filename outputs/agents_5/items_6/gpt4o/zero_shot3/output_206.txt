Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  37   2  58  41  50
1  79  70  56  71  23  14
2  52  31  26  39  38  45
3  95   6  66  57   5  40
4  61  83  57  20  36  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible, given the constraint of 6 items total. This problem can be approached using a greedy strategy based on maximum valuations.

Let's evaluate the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 0 (value 89).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 3 (value 71).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 5 (value 45).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 0, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 2 (value 66).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 5, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 1 (value 83).

Now, let's make sure each agent gets at least one item and that we only allocate 6 items:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [1]

This results in 5 items being allocated. We need to allocate one more item. The item that remains unallocated is item 4. Let's assign it to the agent who values it the most among those who have fewer items:

- Agent 0: 41
- Agent 1: 23
- Agent 2: 38
- Agent 3: 5
- Agent 4: 36

Agent 0 has the highest value for the remaining item, item 4. However, Agent 0 already has one of the highest valued items, so let's allocate it to Agent 2 to balance the allocation.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5, 4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
