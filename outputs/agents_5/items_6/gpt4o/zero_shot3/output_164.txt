Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  44  46  37  65  32
1   2  39  92   5  89  58
2  46  99  56  16   7   4
3  17  32  83   2  10  18
4  34  15  63  36  26   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here is a possible fair allocation where each agent receives items based on their highest valuations in a manner that attempts to balance their total values:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 highly values items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 3 highly values item 2.
- Agent 4 does not have extremely high valuations but can be allocated based on the remaining items.

Here is one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Item 0 (highest value item for agent 0)
- Agent 1: Item 2 (highest value item for agent 1)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (highest value item for agent 2)
- Agent 3: Item 5 (to ensure each agent gets at least one item, and agent 3 gets their highest remaining valued item)
- Agent 4: Item 3 (to ensure each agent gets at least one item)

Now, the remaining item (item 4) can be allocated to maximize the overall satisfaction. Since agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 among the rest of the unallocated items, it makes sense to allocate item 4 to agent 0.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, with an attempt to maximize the valuations based on the given table.
