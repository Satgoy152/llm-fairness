Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  25  88  39  56  56
1  22  48  25  16  36  80
2  99  93  93  87  38   5
3  38  47   5  26  90  15
4  28  93  53  36  67  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[26 25 88 39 56 56]
 [22 48 25 16 36 80]
 [99 93 93 87 38  5]
 [38 47  5 26 90 15]
 [28 93 53 36 67 81]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will focus on maximizing the total valuation for each agent with the constraint that each agent should receive at least one item if possible, and all items should be allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. Agent 0's valuations: [26, 25, 88, 39, 56, 56]
2. Agent 1's valuations: [22, 48, 25, 16, 36, 80]
3. Agent 2's valuations: [99, 93, 93, 87, 38, 5]
4. Agent 3's valuations: [38, 47, 5, 26, 90, 15]
5. Agent 4's valuations: [28, 93, 53, 36, 67, 81]

An allocation strategy that ensures fairness while maximizing valuation could be as follows:

- Assign the highest valued item to each agent if possible, then proceed to the next highest valued unallocated item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 2 (highest value 88 for agent 0).
2. Agent 1 gets item 5 (highest value 80 for agent 1).
3. Agent 2 gets item 0 (highest value 99 for agent 2).
4. Agent 3 gets item 4 (highest value 90 for agent 3).
5. Agent 4 gets item 1 (highest value 93 for agent 4).

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate the last item:

- Item 3 is left.

Let's allocate item 3 to the agent with the next highest valuation who hasn't received their second highest valued item:

- Agent 2 has the next highest valuation for item 3 (87).

Therefore, Agent 2 will also get item 3.

The final allocations in the required JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
