Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  46  96  68  14  99
1  64   8  91  41  45  66
2  59  53  65  70  73   3
3  53  31  92  60  21  45
4  74  28  80  82  33  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed. Given the provided valuations, let's aim for an allocation where each agent gets at least one item, if possible, while maximizing their valuation:

### Valuations:
- Agent 0: [82, 46, 96, 68, 14, 99]
- Agent 1: [64, 8, 91, 41, 45, 66]
- Agent 2: [59, 53, 65, 70, 73, 3]
- Agent 3: [53, 31, 92, 60, 21, 45]
- Agent 4: [74, 28, 80, 82, 33, 38]

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If this leads to an unfair distribution of items (e.g., one agent getting all items), redistribute to ensure each agent receives at least one item.

### Allocation Process:
1. Item 0: Highest valuation is Agent 0 (82).
2. Item 1: Highest valuation is Agent 0 (46), but to balance, assign to Agent 2 (53).
3. Item 2: Highest valuation is Agent 0 (96).
4. Item 3: Highest valuation is Agent 4 (82).
5. Item 4: Highest valuation is Agent 2 (73), but since Agent 2 already has item 1, assign to Agent 1 (45).
6. Item 5: Highest valuation is Agent 0 (99).

To balance the distribution:
- Reassign Item 2 from Agent 0 to Agent 3 (92) to ensure every agent receives at least one item.
- Ensure Agent 0 still gets a fair share: assign Item 5 to Agent 0.

### Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all agents receive at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is six.
