Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  84  17  32  27  16
1  20  56  73  80  45  91
2   9  32  53  31  28  30
3  73   0  91  14  72  48
4  35  57  98  62  25  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Let's consider the valuations provided and try to distribute the items accordingly:

Here are the steps to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - The highest value for agent 0 is item 1 (value 84). Assign item 1 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - The highest value for agent 1 is item 5 (value 91). Assign item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - The highest value for agent 2 is item 2 (value 53). Assign item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - The highest value for agent 3 is item 2 (value 91), but it's already assigned to agent 2. The next highest value is item 0 (value 73). Assign item 0 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - The highest value for agent 4 is item 2 (value 98), but it's already assigned to agent 2. The next highest unassigned item for agent 4 is item 3 (value 62). Assign item 3 to agent 4.

Now, we have assigned items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5. One item remains unassigned, which is item 4. We need to allocate item 4 to an agent who can benefit from it:

6. **Agent 1**: 
   - The next highest unassigned item for agent 1 is item 4 (value 45). Assign item 4 to agent 1.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
