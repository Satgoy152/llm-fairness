Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9   7  50  63  80   5
1  60  41  41  68  93  17
2  33  85  56  41  97   1
3  99  43  18  22  71   7
4  96  66  46  68  69  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for the agents. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item, if possible. However, given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, at least one agent will receive two items.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step allocation:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring all items are assigned:

   - Item 0: Agent 3 values it at 99 (highest).
   - Item 1: Agent 2 values it at 85 (highest).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 50 (highest).
   - Item 3: Agent 1 values it at 68 (highest).
   - Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 97 (highest).
   - Item 5: Agent 4 values it at 59 (highest).

2. Check if all agents have at least one item. If not, adjust allocations to ensure fairness:
   - Agent 0: has 1 item (Item 2)
   - Agent 1: has 1 item (Item 3)
   - Agent 2: has 2 items (Items 1 and 4)
   - Agent 3: has 1 item (Item 0)
   - Agent 4: has 1 item (Item 5)

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```
