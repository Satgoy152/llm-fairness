Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2   1  51   7  89  23
1  42  38  23  95   6  62
2  62  67  59  35  62   0
3  76  66  52  51  84  56
4  23  60  60  68  69  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0**: Valuations are 2, 42, 62, 76, 23. Agent 3 values it the most.
- **Item 1**: Valuations are 1, 38, 67, 66, 60. Agent 2 values it the most.
- **Item 2**: Valuations are 51, 23, 59, 52, 60. Agent 0 values it the most.
- **Item 3**: Valuations are 7, 95, 35, 51, 68. Agent 1 values it the most.
- **Item 4**: Valuations are 89, 6, 62, 84, 69. Agent 0 values it the most again, but we need to ensure fair distribution, so we give it to Agent 4 who also values it high.
- **Item 5**: Valuations are 23, 62, 0, 56, 14. Agent 1 values it the most.

To ensure each agent gets at least one item, we adjust allocations as follows:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3, 5]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [4]

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
