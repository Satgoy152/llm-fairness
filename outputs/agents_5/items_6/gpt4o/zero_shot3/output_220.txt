Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59   5  69  58  37  46
1  50  83  62   5  68  69
2  41  59  52  88  97  55
3  22  31   6  85  41  16
4  47   0  69  41   6  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. This approach ensures that every agent receives at least one item and the allocation maximizes the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 69.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 83.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest at 97.
4. Agent 3 values item 3 the highest at 85.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the highest at 95.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and each agent has received an item. We need to allocate the last item, which is item 0:

- Item 0 can go to Agent 0, who values it at 59, the highest among remaining unallocated items.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation maximizes the individual satisfaction based on agent valuations and ensures that each agent receives at least one item.
