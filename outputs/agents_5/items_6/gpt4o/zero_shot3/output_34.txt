Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  10  43  62   6  51  69
1  56  73  10  28  47  31
2  47  92   0  42  98  37
3  15   1   6  99  22   9
4  49  67  36   2  67  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation. One common approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each item is allocated only once.

Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it at 56, which is the highest amongst all agents.
2. **Item 1:** Agent 2 values it at 92, which is the highest amongst all agents.
3. **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it at 62, which is the highest amongst all agents.
4. **Item 3:** Agent 3 values it at 99, which is the highest amongst all agents.
5. **Item 4:** Agent 2 values it at 98, which is the highest amongst all agents.
6. **Item 5:** Agent 0 values it at 69, which is the highest amongst all agents.

With this allocation strategy, each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most. 

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent and all items are allocated.
