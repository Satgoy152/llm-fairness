Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  55  77  98  26  46
1  68  41  98  61  50  83
2  85   5  77  31  18  75
3  91  62  44  91  29  42
4  18  24  30  71  78  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to each agent, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. This is a typical example of an assignment problem, which can be solved using algorithms such as the Hungarian method. However, since this is a small problem, we can manually assign the items to achieve a reasonable distribution.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 98).
2. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 98).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 3 (value 91).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value 78).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 75).
6. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (value 62).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it highly, balancing the distribution of value received by each agent.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
