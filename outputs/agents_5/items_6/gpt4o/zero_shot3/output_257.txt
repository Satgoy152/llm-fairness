Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 91.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  99  24  90   3  39
1  19  52  91   3  62  71
2  28   1  52  85  59  16
3  99  52  27  83  10  45
4  81  56  92  38  88  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we'll consider the valuations and attempt to distribute the items so that each agent gets a decent total value. We need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation of items based on the given valuations:

- **Agent 0** values item 1 highly, so we can give item 1 to them.
- **Agent 1** values item 2 highly, so we can give item 2 to them.
- **Agent 2** values item 3 highly, so we can give item 3 to them.
- **Agent 3** values item 0 highly, so we can give item 0 to them.
- **Agent 4** values items 4 and 5 highly, so we can give items 4 and 5 to them.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent is given consideration based on their highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
