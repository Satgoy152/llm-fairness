Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  88  26  67  94  43
1  48  34  46  67  46   3
2  17  33  53  48  69   5
3  37  32  58  78  70  78
4  22  11  40  54  63  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations for each item by each agent. One approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent's allocations are integers and all items are distributed.

Let's go through the items:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 3
   - Agent 1 values it at 48
   - Agent 2 values it at 17
   - Agent 3 values it at 37
   - Agent 4 values it at 22
   - Highest valuation: Agent 1

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 88
   - Agent 1 values it at 34
   - Agent 2 values it at 33
   - Agent 3 values it at 32
   - Agent 4 values it at 11
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 26
   - Agent 1 values it at 46
   - Agent 2 values it at 53
   - Agent 3 values it at 58
   - Agent 4 values it at 40
   - Highest valuation: Agent 3

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 67
   - Agent 1 values it at 67
   - Agent 2 values it at 48
   - Agent 3 values it at 78
   - Agent 4 values it at 54
   - Highest valuation: Agent 3

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 94
   - Agent 1 values it at 46
   - Agent 2 values it at 69
   - Agent 3 values it at 70
   - Agent 4 values it at 63
   - Highest valuation: Agent 0

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 43
   - Agent 1 values it at 3
   - Agent 2 values it at 5
   - Agent 3 values it at 78
   - Agent 4 values it at 52
   - Highest valuation: Agent 3

Based on the highest valuations, the allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 4
- Agent 1 gets item 0
- Agent 2 gets no items
- Agent 3 gets items 2, 3, and 5
- Agent 4 gets no items

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 3, 5],
    "4": []
}
```
