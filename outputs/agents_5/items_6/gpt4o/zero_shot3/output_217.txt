Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  25  90  20  59  62
1  32  15  46  81  38  83
2  60  96  32  82  11   2
3  61  94   6  74  61  88
4  25  42   7  14  86  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. We'll try to allocate items to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Since there are more items than agents, some agents will receive multiple items.

Let's attempt a fair allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest with 90, so allocate item 2 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest with 83, so allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the highest with 96, so allocate item 1 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the second highest after agent 2, but since item 1 is taken, the next highest is item 5, which is also taken. Therefore, allocate item 0 with 61 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest with 86, so allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- Item 3 is valued highly by agent 1, but since agent 1 already has item 5, and considering fairness, we will allocate it to agent 3 who also values it with 74.
  
Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all six items are allocated.
