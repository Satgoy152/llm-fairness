Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  29  88  75  97  76
1  40  58  70  39  41  37
2  21  78  96  49  90  66
3  33  85  25  95  74  58
4  20  59  56  24  42  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an equitable portion based on their valuations. A common approach to achieve this is to use a "maximin" strategy, which aims to maximize the minimum value that each agent receives. However, given the integer constraint of item allocation and the requirement that all items must be allocated, we might have to make some compromises.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Calculate Total Value for Each Agent:**  
   Determine the sum of each agent's valuation for all items.

2. **Assign Items to Maximize Fairness:**  
   Start by assigning items to agents based on who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

3. **Adjust for Integer Allocation:**  
   Since each agent must receive an integer number of items, adjust the allocation to ensure that exactly 6 items are allocated in total.

Here's how we can allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (97).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (70).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (96), but since it's already taken, the next highest is item 4 (90).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (95).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (59).

Let's allocate based on these observations:

- **Agent 0** gets item 0.
- **Agent 1** gets item 2.
- **Agent 2** gets item 4.
- **Agent 3** gets item 3.
- **Agent 4** gets item 1 and item 5.

Thus, each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. 

Here's the JSON allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
