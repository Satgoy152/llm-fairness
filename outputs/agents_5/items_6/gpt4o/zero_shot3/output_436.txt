Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  90  86  64  79   1
1  58  79  22  99  18  13
2   2  27  35  10  26  32
3  19  56  30  11  65  33
4  48   9  63  42   1  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the overall value for each agent. One method to achieve this is through a greedy approach, where we assign items to agents based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and every item is assigned.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued item for each agent first.
2. Ensure all items are assigned, and adjust if necessary.

Let's try to allocate the items fairly:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 1.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 3.
3. Agent 2 can be assigned item 5.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 4.
5. Agent 4 can be assigned item 2.

Now, let's check if all items are allocated:

- Item 0 is not yet allocated. We can assign item 0 to Agent 0 as they have the next highest valuation for it.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and every agent receives at least one item.
