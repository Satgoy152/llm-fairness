Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  94   2  62  50  56
1  62  98  49  99  56  34
2  62  31  52  46  45   6
3  61  45  45  11  94  96
4  24  14  50  32  72   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We will aim for an allocation where each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.

Let's start by assigning the items one by one to agents based on their highest value for each item:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 1 values it at 62, which is the highest among all agents.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it at 98, which is the highest among all agents.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it at 49, which is the highest among all agents.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it at 99, which is the highest among all agents.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 3 values it at 94, which is the highest among all agents.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it at 96, which is the highest among all agents.

Now, let's verify the allocations to ensure at least one item per agent:

- Agent 0: No items (adjustment needed)
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 2, 3
- Agent 2: No items (adjustment needed)
- Agent 3: Items 4, 5
- Agent 4: No items (adjustment needed)

Since Agent 1 has been allocated 4 items, we can reallocate some items to ensure each agent gets at least one item. Let's adjust as follows:

- Reallocate Item 2 from Agent 1 to Agent 2.
- Reallocate Item 0 from Agent 1 to Agent 0.
- Keep Item 4 and Item 5 with Agent 3.
- Allocate Item 3 to Agent 4 from Agent 1.

Thus, the final allocation could look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated, each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.
