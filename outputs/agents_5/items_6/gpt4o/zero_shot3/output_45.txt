Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  89  44  68  26  59
1  66  53  82  22   1  56
2  33  76  44  31  65  62
3  49  64  62  27   0  70
4  63  12  87  68  45  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[57 89 44 68 26 59]
 [66 53 82 22  1 56]
 [33 76 44 31 65 62]

 [63 12 87 68 45 35]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's analyze the table and make the allocations:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 values it at 57
   - Agent 1 values it at 66
   - Agent 2 values it at 33
   - Agent 3 values it at 49
   - Agent 4 values it at 63
   - Assign to Agent 1 (highest value: 66)

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 values it at 89
   - Agent 1 values it at 53
   - Agent 2 values it at 76
   - Agent 3 values it at 64
   - Agent 4 values it at 12
   - Assign to Agent 0 (highest value: 89)

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 44
   - Agent 1 values it at 82
   - Agent 2 values it at 44
   - Agent 3 values it at 62
   - Agent 4 values it at 87
   - Assign to Agent 4 (highest value: 87)

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 values it at 68
   - Agent 1 values it at 22
   - Agent 2 values it at 31
   - Agent 3 values it at 27
   - Agent 4 values it at 68
   - Assign to Agent 0 (tie between agent 0 and agent 4, choose agent 0)

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 values it at 26
   - Agent 1 values it at 1
   - Agent 2 values it at 65
   - Agent 3 values it at 0
   - Agent 4 values it at 45
   - Assign to Agent 2 (highest value: 65)

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 59
   - Agent 1 values it at 56
   - Agent 2 values it at 62
   - Agent 3 values it at 70
   - Agent 4 values it at 35
   - Assign to Agent 3 (highest value: 70)

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```
