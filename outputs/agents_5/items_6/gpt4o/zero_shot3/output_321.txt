Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  80  37  47  73  56
1  85  72  35  95  15  72
2  35  48  82  99   5  93
3  59  39  70  92  63  44
4  59  71  31  63  78  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, we'll need to distribute the items such that:

1. Each agent receives at least one item.
2. One agent will receive two items.

Let's analyze the table and allocate based on the highest value each agent places on an item.

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most with 80.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most with 95.
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most with 99, but since that item is already taken, we'll consider the next highest, which is item 5 with 93.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most with 92, but that item is taken, so we'll consider item 2 with 70.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most with 78.

At this point, all agents have at least one item, and we have one item left to allocate. The item left is item 0. We'll allocate it to the agent that values it the most and who can still gain from an additional item.

- Item 0 is valued the highest by Agent 1 with 85.

Now, let's present the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
