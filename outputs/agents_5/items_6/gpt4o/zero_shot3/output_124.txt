Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  70  27  20  13  97
1  58  15  67  65  43  62
2  88  14  35  32  43  97
3  74  13  52  70  50   0
4  78  26  64  56  58  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 15 67 65 43 62]
 [88 14 35 32 43 97]

 [78 26 64 56 58 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction or total value that each agent receives, while ensuring that all items are allocated. This can be a complex problem, but one approach is to use a greedy algorithm to allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (valuation of 97).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (valuation of 88).
3. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (valuation of 70).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (valuation of 67).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (valuation of 58).
6. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (valuation of 70).

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
