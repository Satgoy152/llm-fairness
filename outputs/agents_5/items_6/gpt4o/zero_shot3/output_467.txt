Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  12  40  37  92  87
1  73  42  15  48  75  63
2  73  51  95  85  98  45
3  32  93  23  39  30  47
4  53  72  95   3  97  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[93 12 40 37 92 87]
 [73 42 15 48 75 63]
 [73 51 95 85 98 45]

 [53 72 95  3 97 49]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 2, who values it most at 95.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 2, who values it second most at 85.
3. Assign item 4 to agent 2, who values it most at 98.
4. Assign item 0 to agent 0, who values it most at 93.
5. Assign item 1 to agent 3, who values it most at 93.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0, who values it second most at 87.

This allocation gives each agent the maximum total valuation possible under the constraints of the problem.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2, 3, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.
