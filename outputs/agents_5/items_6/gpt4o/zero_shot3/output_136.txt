Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  77  71   7  23  97
1  36  26   9  55  69  15
2  36  24  63  44  80  22
3  78  53  18  37  65  24
4   8  74   6  94  30  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 1 and 5.
2. **Agent 1** might prefer item 4 due to a relatively higher valuation.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 2.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 0.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 3.

Given this analysis, one possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: Item [0]
- Agent 4: Item [3]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated, with each agent obtaining an item they value highly.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```
