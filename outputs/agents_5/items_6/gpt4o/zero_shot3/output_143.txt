Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  51  64  81  57   6
1  90  43   4  54  46  16
2  53  76  82  61  22  93
3  13  40  79   3  44  76
4  72  16  89  92  90  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.
2. If an agent does not receive any items, consider reallocating items to ensure all agents get at least one.

Let's execute this strategy:

- Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most at 90.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 51.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most at 89.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most at 92.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most at 90.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 93.

Now, let's check the allocation:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: []
- Agent 4: [2, 3, 4]

Agent 3 has not been assigned any items, and Agent 4 has been assigned three items. We need to adjust the distribution to ensure Agent 3 receives at least one item. Let's reallocate item 4 from Agent 4 to Agent 3, as Agent 3 values it reasonably well (44).

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [2, 3]

Now each agent has at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```
