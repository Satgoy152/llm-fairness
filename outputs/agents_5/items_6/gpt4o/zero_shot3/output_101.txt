Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  50  16  93  83  29
1  19  20  35  56  42   7
2  31  79  73  29  58  34
3  47  13  42   2  56  56
4   5  51  32  41  29  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that the overall satisfaction or value derived is maximized, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [44, 50, 16, 93, 83, 29]
Agent 1: [19, 20, 35, 56, 42, 7]
Agent 2: [31, 79, 73, 29, 58, 34]
Agent 3: [47, 13, 42, 2, 56, 56]
Agent 4: [5, 51, 32, 41, 29, 70]
```

We will aim to allocate items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. 

1. **Item 3** has the highest value for Agent 0 (93), so assign it to Agent 0.
2. **Item 1** has the highest value for Agent 2 (79), so assign it to Agent 2.
3. **Item 5** has the highest value for Agent 4 (70), so assign it to Agent 4.
4. **Item 4** has the highest value for Agent 0 (83), but Agent 0 already has an item. Agent 3 values it at 56, which is the next highest, so assign it to Agent 3.
5. **Item 2** has the highest value for Agent 2 (73), but Agent 2 already has an item. Agent 1 values it at 35, which is the next highest, so assign it to Agent 1.
6. **Item 0** has the highest value for Agent 0 (44), but Agent 0 already has an item. Agent 3 values it at 47, which is the highest remaining value, so assign it to Agent 3.

Now, let's verify the allocations:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [0, 4]
- Agent 4: [5]

This ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```
