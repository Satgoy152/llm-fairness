Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  11  97  21   4   9
1  31  84  93  98  89  30
2  93   5  90  42   3   1
3  62  54  36  79  36  69
4  66  31  52  88  15  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy aiming to maximize the total value each agent receives. We will assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives a roughly equal number of items since there are 6 items and 5 agents.

Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:

1. **Identify Maximum Valuation for Each Item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. **Assign Items**: Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.
3. **Balance the Allocation**: Since there are 6 items and 5 agents, one agent will receive 2 items and others will receive 1 item each. If necessary, adjust the allocation to maintain fairness.

Let's go through the items:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values this item the most at 93.
- **Item 1**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 84.
- **Item 2**: Agent 0 values this item the most at 97.
- **Item 3**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 98.
- **Item 4**: Agent 1 values this item the most at 89.
- **Item 5**: Agent 3 values this item the most at 69.

Initially, the assignment is:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [1, 3, 4] (3 items, need to reassign 2 items)
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: []

To balance the allocations:
- Move item 4 from Agent 1 to Agent 4 since Agent 1 has too many items.
- Move item 1 from Agent 1 to Agent 0 since Agent 1 has too many items and Agent 0 has only one item, and Agent 0 values item 1 second highest.

The adjusted allocation is:
- Agent 0: [2, 1]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [4]

This allocation gives each agent one item, except Agent 0 who gets two, which is fair given the constraints.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```
