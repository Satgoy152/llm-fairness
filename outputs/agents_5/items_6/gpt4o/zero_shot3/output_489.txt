Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  56   3  58  57  95
1  14  80  44   0  64   8
2  43  41   2  66  68   2
3  70  67  24  75  59  56
4  82  51  89  66  18  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 56  3 58 57 95]
 [14 80 44  0 64  8]
 [43 41  2 66 68  2]
 [70 67 24 75 59 56]
 [82 51 89 66 18 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method where each agent receives at least one item, and we try to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 5 the highest (95). Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 1 the highest (80). Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest (68). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the highest (75). Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 2 the highest (89). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. The remaining item is 0. We check who values it the most among the agents who have not already received their highest valued item:

- Agent 4 values item 0 at 82, which is the highest remaining valuation for item 0.

Thus, assign item 0 to Agent 4 as well.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.
