Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  59  32  45  55  66
1  24  55  87  45  99  70
2  53  61  28   7  39   5
3  84  38   7  88  67   5
4  67  52  13  73  32  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy approach that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will have to receive two items. We will start by assigning the highest valued items to the agents who value them most, and then adjust to ensure fairness.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Identify the highest value for each item and allocate it to the corresponding agent.
2. Adjust the allocations to ensure fairness, so that no agent is left without items unless absolutely necessary.

Here's the allocation process:

- Item 0: Highest value is 84 (Agent 3)
- Item 1: Highest value is 61 (Agent 2)
- Item 2: Highest value is 87 (Agent 1)
- Item 3: Highest value is 88 (Agent 3)
- Item 4: Highest value is 99 (Agent 1)
- Item 5: Highest value is 70 (Agent 1)

After the initial allocation, Agent 1 has three items, which needs adjustment as it exceeds the number of items an agent should ideally receive.

Reallocate to balance the load:

- Reassign Item 5 to Agent 0, who values it at 66 (next highest after Agent 1's 70).

Now, the allocation looks like this:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Items 2, 4
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 0, 3
- Agent 4: No items

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly and each agent gets at least one item, except Agent 4 who unfortunately does not value any item highly enough to justify a switch. 

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": []
}
```
