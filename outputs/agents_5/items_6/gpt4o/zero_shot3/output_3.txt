Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  35  21  24  90  16
1  21  57  29  30  30  17
2  82   1  90  26   0  41
3   0  56  44  76  10  12
4  60  33  97   1  13  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents based on the highest valuations for each item, ensuring each agent receives a fair distribution of items.
2. Try to balance the number of items each agent receives.

Let's consider the valuations and allocate accordingly:

- **Agent 0** has the highest valuation for item 4.
- **Agent 1** has a decent valuation for item 1.
- **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 2.
- **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 3.
- **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 5.
- We need to allocate item 0, which has high value for Agent 0.

Based on these considerations, here is one possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [0, 4]
- **Agent 1**: [1]
- **Agent 2**: [2]
- **Agent 3**: [3]
- **Agent 4**: [5]

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
