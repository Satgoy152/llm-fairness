Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 82.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  93  81  33  55  60
1  97  57  82  25  85  68
2  47  43   4   6  70  71
3  48  88  89  54  33  85
4  72  31  24  36  88   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[42 93 81 33 55 60]
 [97 57 82 25 85 68]
 [47 43  4  6 70 71]
 [48 88 89 54 33 85]
 [72 31 24 36 88  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate all the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or value. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (93)
   - Allocation: Item 1

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (97)
   - Allocation: Item 0

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (71)
   - Allocation: Item 5

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (89)
   - Allocation: Item 2

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (88)
   - Allocation: Item 4

Now, we have allocated 5 items. The remaining item is Item 3. Let's allocate it to an agent with a reasonable valuation:

- Agent 3 has a reasonable valuation of Item 3 (54).

Thus, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
