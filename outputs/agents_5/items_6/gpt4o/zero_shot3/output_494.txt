Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  31  45  72  40  40
1  29   9  92  35  58   2
2  26  29  13  87  79  20
3   1  43  16  82  29  38
4  99  79   9  23  52   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are distributed. One common approach is to maximize the total valuation by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 3 (72), Item 0 (45), Item 2 (45)
   - Assign Item 3 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (92)
   - Assign Item 2 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (79)
   - Assign Item 4 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (82) (already taken by Agent 0)
   - Next highest: Item 1 (43)
   - Assign Item 1 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (99), Item 1 (79) (already taken by Agent 3)
   - Assign Item 0 to Agent 4

Now we have one item remaining (Item 5). To ensure fairness and considering remaining unallocated items:

- **Agent 2**: Assign the remaining Item 5 (20) to Agent 2, as Agent 2 values it more than Agent 3 and Agent 4.

The final allocation results in:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```
