Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  56   6   5  95  97
1  51  48  96  73  43  57
2  57  53   7  12  42  13
3  46  41  83  36  36  69
4  63  38  82  33  13  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives according to their preferences. Given the valuations provided, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets items they value highly, while ensuring all items are allocated.

To begin, we can analyze the highest values each agent assigns to the items and try to allocate items accordingly. Hereâ€™s one way to fairly distribute the items:

1. **Agent 0** highly values items 4 and 5, with values of 95 and 97 respectively.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 2 with a value of 96.
3. **Agent 2** does not have particularly high valuations, but item 0 has the highest value at 57.
4. **Agent 3** has a high valuation for item 2, but it's already allocated to Agent 1. Item 5 is their next highest valued item, with a value of 69.
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 highly, but it has been allocated, so they can be given item 1, which they value at 38.

Based on this analysis, a possible allocation could be:

- **Agent 0** receives items 4 and 5.
- **Agent 1** receives item 2.
- **Agent 2** receives item 0.
- **Agent 3** receives no items since their highest preferred items are already allocated.
- **Agent 4** receives item 1.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1]
}
```
