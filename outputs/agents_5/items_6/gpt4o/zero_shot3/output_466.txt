Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  84  51  62  43  43
1  46  91  60  57   0  66
2  13  83  19  42  51  31
3  22   9  96  14  98  96
4  95  40  10  64  41  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 91 60 57  0 66]
 [13 83 19 42 51 31]

 [95 40 10 64 41 33]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, let's consider maximizing the total valuation of items received by each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. We will also ensure that all 6 items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (84), Item 3 (62)
   - Allocate: Item 1

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (91), Item 5 (66)
   - Allocate: Item 5

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest values: Item 1 (83), Item 4 (51)
   - Allocate: Item 4

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest values: Item 4 (98), Item 5 (96)
   - Allocate: Item 2

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest values: Item 0 (95), Item 3 (64)
   - Allocate: Item 0, Item 3

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated only once, and each agent receives an integer number of items. All 6 items are allocated in total.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```
