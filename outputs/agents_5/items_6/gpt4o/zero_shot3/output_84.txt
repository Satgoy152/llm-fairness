Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  88  87  86  31  46
1  90  96  13   9  41   9
2  48  30  15  92  34  59
3  11  99  17  80  67  23
4  77  87  17  42  81  74

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's one potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 1 (value 88). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 1 (value 96), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 0 (value 90). Assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 3 (value 92). Assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 1 (value 99), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 3 (value 80), but it's also taken. The next highest is item 4 (value 67). Assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 4 (value 81), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 1 (value 87), but it's taken. The next highest is item 0 (value 77), but it's taken. The next highest is item 5 (value 74). Assign item 5 to agent 4.

After assigning the highest available valued items, we have allocated five items. The unallocated item is item 2. Since agent 3 has not received an item yet, we can assign item 2 to agent 3.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to an agent, and each agent receives items fairly based on their valuation preferences.
