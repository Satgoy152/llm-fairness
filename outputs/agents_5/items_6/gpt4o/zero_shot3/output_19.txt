Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  86  24  13  70  55
1  50  35  20  19  72  80
2  39  73  84  29  70  87
3  12  42  86  44  21  36
4  39  58   7  25  71  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can use a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most and then ensure that the distribution is balanced among agents.

Let's go through the valuations to allocate items such that each agent gets at least one item and no agent gets more than two items (since there are 5 agents and 6 items).

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the items to the agents with the highest valuations for each item:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most with 65.
   - Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most with 86.
   - Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most with 86.
   - Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most with 44.
   - Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most with 72.
   - Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most with 87.

2. Check if any agent has more than two items, and make adjustments if necessary:
   - Agent 0 has items 0 and 1.
   - Agent 3 has items 2 and 3.
   - Agent 1 has item 4.
   - Agent 2 has item 5.
   - Agent 4 has no items.

3. Since Agent 4 has no items, we can try to reallocate one item from an agent with two items to Agent 4:
   - Reallocate item 3 from Agent 3 to Agent 4.

Now, the allocation is balanced with each agent having at least one item, and no agent having more than two items. Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```
