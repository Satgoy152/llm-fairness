Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15   5  21  64  12  52
1  39  87  42  13  54  94
2  83  98  53  30  74  33
3  75  76  41  94   6  73
4  96  16  53  39  70  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the "maximin" approach, where we try to maximize the minimum valuation each agent receives. This approach ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the allocations are as fair as possible given the constraints.

Let's examine the valuations and determine a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (64).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (94).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (98).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (94), but since it's already considered for Agent 0, we'll look at the next highest, which is item 1 (76), but it's considered for Agent 2. So, we look at item 0 (75).
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (96), but since it's considered for Agent 3, we'll look at item 5 (86).

Considering these valuations, we allocate as follows to ensure no conflict and all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: item 3 (64)
- Agent 1: item 5 (94)
- Agent 2: item 1 (98)
- Agent 3: item 0 (75)
- Agent 4: item 2 (53) and item 4 (70)

Now, letâ€™s represent this allocation in the JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are fairly distributed.
