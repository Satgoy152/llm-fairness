Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  36  76  56  88  46
1   1  19  80  41  21  15
2  93  46  35  88  99  94
3   7  63  71  28  60  99
4  34  69  30  41  58  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the remaining agents will each get 1 item.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 values:
  - Item 0: 11
  - Item 1: 36
  - Item 2: 76
  - Item 3: 56
  - Item 4: 88
  - Item 5: 46

- Agent 1 values:
  - Item 0: 1
  - Item 1: 19
  - Item 2: 80
  - Item 3: 41
  - Item 4: 21
  - Item 5: 15

- Agent 2 values:
  - Item 0: 93
  - Item 1: 46
  - Item 2: 35
  - Item 3: 88
  - Item 4: 99
  - Item 5: 94

- Agent 3 values:
  - Item 0: 7
  - Item 1: 63
  - Item 2: 71
  - Item 3: 28
  - Item 4: 60
  - Item 5: 99

- Agent 4 values:
  - Item 0: 34
  - Item 1: 69
  - Item 2: 30
  - Item 3: 41
  - Item 4: 58
  - Item 5: 25

Based on the valuations, let's allocate the items for maximum fairness:

1. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest with 99, and item 5 with 94. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
2. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest with 99. Assign item 5 to agent 3.
3. After removing these items, allocate the remaining items based on highest valuations.
4. Agent 0 values item 2 the highest with 76. Assign item 2 to agent 0.
5. Agent 1 values item 2 the highest but it's taken, next highest is item 3 with 41. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
6. Agent 4 values item 1 the highest with 69. Assign item 1 to agent 4.
7. The remaining item 0 goes to Agent 2 who valued it at 93.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the values provided by each agent.
