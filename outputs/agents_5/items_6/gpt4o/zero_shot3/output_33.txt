Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27   2  92  38  24  12
1  76  19  72   5  42  95
2  82  93  74  40   9  96
3  11  74  85  27  66  87
4  29  10  81  39  63  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[27  2 92 38 24 12]
 [76 19 72  5 42 95]
 [82 93 74 40  9 96]

 [29 10 81 39 63 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuation that each agent has for each item. Our goal is to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and all items are distributed. Let's look at the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [27, 2, 92, 38, 24, 12]
Agent 1: [76, 19, 72, 5, 42, 95]
Agent 2: [82, 93, 74, 40, 9, 96]
Agent 3: [11, 74, 85, 27, 66, 87]
Agent 4: [29, 10, 81, 39, 63, 11]
```

A fair allocation should take into consideration the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring a fair distribution of items. Let's see how we can allocate items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (92).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (95).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (93).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (27), but item 2 (85) is already taken, so item 4 (66) is best remaining.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (63), but item 4 is already taken, so item 3 (39) is best remaining.

Let's finalize the allocation based on maximizing valuations and ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, item 0 is left. We'll assign it to Agent 0 since they have space, and this increases their total valuation without taking away from others.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [2, 0]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [3]

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
