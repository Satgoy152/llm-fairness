Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  95  10  29  50  11
1  61  37  42  40  52  13
2  42  71  94  61  50  95
3  57  24  36  21  79  59
4  11  96  40  74   6  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm approach. The basic idea is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation for item 0 is by agent 1 with a value of 61.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation for item 1 is by agent 4 with a value of 96.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation for item 2 is by agent 2 with a value of 94.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation for item 3 is by agent 4 with a value of 74.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation for item 4 is by agent 3 with a value of 79.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation for item 5 is by agent 2 with a value of 95.

Let's ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible:

- Agent 0 has no items assigned, so we will allocate an item with the next highest value that can be reassigned without significantly reducing fairness. Agent 0 has the second highest value for item 0 (22), but since agent 1 already has item 0, let's look for a different reassignment. Agent 0’s highest value is for item 4 (50, but it’s already assigned to agent 3 with a value of 79). Reallocation isn’t possible without reducing fairness significantly, so agent 0 will remain unassigned.

- Agent 1 has item 0.
- Agent 2 has items 2 and 5.
- Agent 3 has item 4.
- Agent 4 has items 1 and 3.

Now we ensure the allocation is fair and complete:

- Total items allocated: 6 (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Here’s the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```
