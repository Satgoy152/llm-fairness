Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  14  13  92  27  86
1  33  29  36   4  18  27
2  80  57  45  74  43  59
3  81  58  60  97  79  23
4  69  98  62   5  72   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[89 14 13 92 27 86]
 [33 29 36  4 18 27]
 [80 57 45 74 43 59]

 [69 98 62  5 72  3]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. A good approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through this process:

1. For item 0, the highest value is 89 by agent 0.
2. For item 1, the highest value is 98 by agent 4.
3. For item 2, the highest value is 62 by agent 4.
4. For item 3, the highest value is 97 by agent 3.
5. For item 4, the highest value is 79 by agent 3.
6. For item 5, the highest value is 86 by agent 0.

Now let's compile these allocations:

- Agent 0 gets items [0, 5]
- Agent 1 gets no items []
- Agent 2 gets no items []
- Agent 3 gets items [3, 4]
- Agent 4 gets items [1, 2]

Here's how the allocation would look in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```
