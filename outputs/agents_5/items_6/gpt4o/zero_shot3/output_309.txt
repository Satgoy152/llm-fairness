Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  36  44   7  93  42
1   5  18  15  19  17  93
2  93   1  11  79  98  25
3  46  66  42  92  30  60
4  63  67  92  27  24  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive, considering their individual valuations. The goal is to distribute the items so that the overall satisfaction across all agents is balanced.

Here is one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (93).
- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (93).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (98).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (92).
- Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (92).

To ensure fairness, we can allocate the highest-valued items to the respective agents and then distribute the remaining items to balance out the allocation. Here is a fair allocation:

- Allocate item 4 to agent 2.
- Allocate item 5 to agent 1.
- Allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- Allocate item 2 to agent 4.
- Allocate item 0 to agent 0.
- Allocate item 1 to agent 4 (since agent 4 values item 1 significantly).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while considering the agents' preferences.
