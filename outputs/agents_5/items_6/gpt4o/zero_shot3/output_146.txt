Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  84  42  30  34  66
1  93  62  25  25  62  12
2  19  91  22  23  25  24
3  49  35  46  87  94  80
4  12  46  46  53  56   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent. The goal is to ensure that the items are distributed in a way that each agent's total valuation of their allocated items is maximized, while ensuring every item is allocated exactly once.

Let's consider the given valuation table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  84  42  30  34  66
1  93  62  25  25  62  12
2  19  91  22  23  25  24
3  49  35  46  87  94  80
4  12  46  46  53  56   0
```

A potential method to allocate items could be to assign each item to the agent that values it the most, while keeping track of the total number of items assigned to each agent. Let's follow this approach:

1. Item 0: Agent 1 values it the most (93).
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (91).
3. Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most (42).
4. Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most (87).
5. Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most (94).
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (66).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an item if possible:

- Agent 0: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [0]
- Agent 2: Item [1]
- Agent 3: Items [3, 4]
- Agent 4: No items

This allocation ensures each item is allocated exactly once, and the allocations are as fair as possible based on the given valuations.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation uses all 6 items and provides each agent with an integer number of items.
