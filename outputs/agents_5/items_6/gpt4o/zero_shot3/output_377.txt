Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  38  22  21  41  26
1  26   1  10   4  95  55
2  67  55  96  32  74  93
3  95  47  61  32  78  13
4  80  53  82  48  55  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach to maximize the total value assigned while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. This problem can be likened to a constrained optimization problem.

Here's a step-by-step plan for a fair allocation:

1. **Initial Consideration**: Check the total number of items (6) and ensure each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, we can start by assigning one item to each agent based on their highest valuation.

2. **Maximize Individual Satisfaction**: Assign each agent their most valued item first, unless it has already been assigned.

3. **Remaining Items**: Once each agent has at least one item, assign the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction by looking at remaining highest valuations.

Here's how it can be done:

- Agent 0's highest value item is 0 (57).
- Agent 1's highest value item is 4 (95).
- Agent 2's highest value item is 2 (96).
- Agent 3's highest value item is 0 (95), but item 0 is already taken, so we move to their next highest, item 4 (78).
- Agent 4's highest value item is 0 (80), but it's taken, so we go to item 5 (94).

Now let's assign the remaining items:

- Items 1 and 3 are not yet assigned. Assign item 1 to the agent with the next highest valuation for it, which is Agent 2 (55).
- Assign item 3 to the agent with the next highest valuation for it, which is Agent 4 (48).

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 1],
    "3": [],
    "4": [5, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed while attempting to maximize each agent's satisfaction given the constraints.
