Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  21  42  39  56  15
1  58  58  65  14  19  24
2  99  91  76  85  91  64
3  56  39  15  70  61  66
4  99   3  50  51  45  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We can use a greedy approach to assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring no agent ends up with more than one item until all agents have at least one item, if possible.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most (99), so assign Item 0 to Agent 4.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most (91), so assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most (65), so assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most (70), so assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most (56), so assign Item 4 to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 3 values it the most (66) among the remaining choices, but Agent 3 already has an item. The next highest is Agent 2, but they also have an item. Therefore, assign Item 5 to Agent 0, who values it at 15 and has only one item so far.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated while maximizing individual agent satisfaction based on their valuations.
