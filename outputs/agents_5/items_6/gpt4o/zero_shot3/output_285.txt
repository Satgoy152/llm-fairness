Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3  97  89  35  30  42
1  80  73  87   1  12  18
2  31  40  52  68  75  32
3  29  65  46  76  17  23
4  71  25  23   0  11  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach where we try to maximize the sum of the valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and every item is allocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. Identify the highest value for each agent and allocate that item to the respective agent if it hasn't been allocated yet. If an item has already been allocated, move to the next highest value for that agent.

2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.

3. Continue allocating the remaining items to the agents based on the next highest values.

Using this approach, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high value for item 1.
- Agent 1 has high value for item 2.
- Agent 2 has high value for item 4.
- Agent 3 has high value for item 3.
- Agent 4 has high value for item 0.

Now, allocate the remaining item (item 5) to the agent with the next highest value for unallocated items.

Here's the allocation based on this approach:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

Each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.
