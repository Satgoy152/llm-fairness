Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  24  72  10  33  28
1  38  25  65  89  92  19
2  72  42  17  71   7  87
3  15  52  92  17  59  41
4  83  88  51  53  96  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. This involves considering the valuations each agent has for the items and distributing the items in a way that attempts to maximize the total value received by each agent.

Let's examine the valuations and try to assign items to agents:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - High value for item 0: Value 81
   - High value for item 2: Value 72

2. **Agent 1**:
   - High value for item 4: Value 92
   - High value for item 3: Value 89

3. **Agent 2**:
   - High value for item 5: Value 87
   - High value for item 0: Value 72

4. **Agent 3**:
   - High value for item 2: Value 92
   - High value for item 4: Value 59

5. **Agent 4**:
   - High value for item 4: Value 96
   - High value for item 1: Value 88

Let's allocate items based on these valuations while ensuring each agent receives some items and all 6 items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 0 (Value 81)
- Agent 1: Allocate item 3 (Value 89), item 4 (Value 92)
- Agent 2: Allocate item 5 (Value 87)
- Agent 3: Allocate item 2 (Value 92)
- Agent 4: Allocate item 1 (Value 88)

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
