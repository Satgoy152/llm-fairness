Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  55  11   1  47  44
1  26   4   0   0  98   6
2  38  80   4  63  75  79
3  38  90  37  65  34  56
4  66  90  42  93  69  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use an approach that attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction or value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. One simple way is to iteratively assign the item with the highest available value to the agent who values it the most, then remove that item from consideration.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 4** has the highest value for agent 1, so assign item 4 to agent 1.
2. **Item 3** has the highest value for agent 4, so assign item 3 to agent 4.
3. **Item 1** has the highest value for agent 3, so assign item 1 to agent 3.
4. **Item 5** has the highest value for agent 2, so assign item 5 to agent 2.
5. **Item 0** has the highest value for agent 0, so assign item 0 to agent 0.
6. **Item 2** can be assigned to agent 4, who has the highest remaining value for it.

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most and attempts to distribute items fairly among the agents.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and all items are distributed among the agents.
