Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  84  71  47  82  53
1  43   5  32  78  80   2
2  59   0  52  75   2   5
3  31  51  58  71  91  55
4   7  68  61  20  27  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on the given valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** Look for the highest valuations each agent has for the items. This helps ensure that each agent gets at least one item they value highly.

2. **Assign Items:** Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most. If any conflicts arise (two agents valuing the same item the highest), resolve them by comparing the next highest valuations or finding a fair compromise.

3. **Distribute Remaining Items:** Once each agent has at least one item, distribute the remaining items to maximize the total valuation each agent receives.

Let's apply this approach to the given data:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 1 the most at 84.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 4 the most at 80.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 0 the most at 59.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 4 the most at 91.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 1 the most at 68.

Given the conflicts, let's resolve them:

- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values at 84, Agent 4 values at 68. Assign to Agent 0.
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values at 80, Agent 3 values at 91. Assign to Agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- **Item 0:** Agent 2 values at 59.
- **Item 2:** Highest left valuation is by Agent 0 at 71.
- **Item 3:** Highest left valuation is by Agent 1 at 78.
- **Item 5:** Highest left valuation is by Agent 3 at 55.

Now that all items are allocated, let's present the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets an integer number of items, all items are distributed, and the assignments reflect the highest possible valuations.
