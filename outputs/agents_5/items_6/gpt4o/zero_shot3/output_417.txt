Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82   7  30   4  43  52
1  34  51  66  30  43  42
2  56  36   4  82  14   8
3  62  75  83  75   1  49
4  10  61   7  36   8  56

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are distributed, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. This involves assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it highest at 82.
2. Assign item 2 to agent 3 because agent 3 values it highest at 83.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 3 because agent 3 values it highest at 75.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 4 because agent 4 values it highest at 56.
5. Assign item 0 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it highest at 82.
6. Assign item 4 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it highest at 43.

Every item has been assigned, and each agent has received items based on their highest valuations among the remaining unallocated items. Hereâ€™s the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [5]
}
```
