Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5   5  14  60  45  90
1  39  92  80  61  18  60
2  28  80  76  26  67  66
3  64  96  54  99  72  42
4  99  66   2  93  98  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. The goal is to allocate the items in such a way that each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences. One approach is to maximize the total value for each agent by examining the valuations and assigning items accordingly. Here's how we can do this:

1. **Prioritize High Valuation Items:** Assign items to agents who value them the most, ensuring each item is allocated.
2. **Ensure Each Agent Receives Items:** While maximizing the valuation, ensure that the allocation is fair and covers all items.
3. **Check Total Number of Items:** Ensure that all 6 items are allocated among the agents.

Based on the provided valuations, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 highly (90), so assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (92), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly (76), so assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly (99), so assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly (99), so assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, for item 4 which has not been assigned, we can allocate it to:
- Agent 4, who values it at 98, which is the highest valuation left.

Finally, we can present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is allocated based on the highest valuation while distributing the items among the agents fairly.
