Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  21  63  24  42  40
1  25  66   8  35  93  97
2  62  73  99  18  57  51
3  64  36  54  72   7  33
4  95  37   0  12  90  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing total valuation while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. This involves assigning items to agents such that the total value is maximized under the constraint that each agent receives some items, even if it's possible to have some agents receive none.

To achieve this, we can follow a simple greedy strategy:
1. Analyze the value each agent has for each item.
2. Assign items to agents based on maximizing the individual agent's valuation for each item.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values it the most at 95.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 1 values it the most at 66.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 99.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most at 72.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it the most at 93.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most at 97.

Now let's check the allocation:
- Agent 0 does not get any item.
- Agent 1 gets items 1, 4, and 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 0.

The allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 4, 5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are allocated and the total valuation is maximized based on the given preferences.
