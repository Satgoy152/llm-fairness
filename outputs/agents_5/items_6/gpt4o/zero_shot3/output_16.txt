Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  57  87  81  41  48
1  13  76  92  36  53  80
2   1  94  94  38  30  70
3  95  69  61  10  17  26
4  45  13  53  89  93  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the strategy of maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. There are 5 agents and 6 items, so at least one agent will receive more items than others.

Let's look at the valuations provided:

```
Agent 0: [4, 57, 87, 81, 41, 48]
Agent 1: [13, 76, 92, 36, 53, 80]
Agent 2: [1, 94, 94, 38, 30, 70]
Agent 3: [95, 69, 61, 10, 17, 26]
Agent 4: [45, 13, 53, 89, 93, 93]
```

We aim to distribute the 6 items among the 5 agents in a way that maximizes their individual valuations. The allocation involves assigning the highest valued unallocated item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 3 (value 95).
2. Assign item 1 to Agent 2 (value 94).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 1 (value 92).
4. Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (value 89).
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 4 (value 93).
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 80).

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it the most. Let's confirm that every item is assigned:

- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [2, 5]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [3, 4]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This approach ensures that the items are allocated to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.
