Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4   2  78  15  85  44
1  14  86  43  42  72  51
2  94  80  87  48  41   8
3  23  68   7  99  94  16
4  65  13  93  69  43  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all 6 items being allocated. One approach is to maximize the total valuation for the group by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. However, since this is a small problem, we can also look for a balanced allocation that considers fairness.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 2 (value 94).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 86).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 4 (value 93).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 99).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (value 85).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 51).

This ensures that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item, except for agent 0 who still receives an item, maintaining fairness by valuation.

Here is the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation respects the requirement that all six items are distributed among the agents, while trying to maximize the value each agent receives based on their preferences.
