Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  60   0  82  13  72
1  54  70  56  73   0  22
2  66  41  89  17  27  37
3  53  99  39   1  54  47
4  68  16  24  80  69  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify the Agent with Highest Valuation for Each Item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. **Allocate Items Based on Highest Valuation**: Assign each item to the agent that values it the most. This ensures that each item is allocated to an agent that places the highest worth on it.
3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated**: We need to ensure that all 6 items are allocated among the agents.

Let's apply this method to the given valuations:

- **Item 0**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 28
  - Agent 1 values it at 54
  - Agent 2 values it at 66
  - Agent 3 values it at 53
  - Agent 4 values it at 68
  - Highest Valuation: Agent 4

- **Item 1**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 60
  - Agent 1 values it at 70
  - Agent 2 values it at 41
  - Agent 3 values it at 99
  - Agent 4 values it at 16
  - Highest Valuation: Agent 3

- **Item 2**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 0
  - Agent 1 values it at 56
  - Agent 2 values it at 89
  - Agent 3 values it at 39
  - Agent 4 values it at 24
  - Highest Valuation: Agent 2

- **Item 3**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 82
  - Agent 1 values it at 73
  - Agent 2 values it at 17
  - Agent 3 values it at 1
  - Agent 4 values it at 80
  - Highest Valuation: Agent 0

- **Item 4**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 13
  - Agent 1 values it at 0
  - Agent 2 values it at 27
  - Agent 3 values it at 54
  - Agent 4 values it at 69
  - Highest Valuation: Agent 4

- **Item 5**: 
  - Agent 0 values it at 72
  - Agent 1 values it at 22
  - Agent 2 values it at 37
  - Agent 3 values it at 47
  - Agent 4 values it at 49
  - Highest Valuation: Agent 0

Now, let's assign the items to agents based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 5
- Agent 1: No items
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Items 0, 4

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
