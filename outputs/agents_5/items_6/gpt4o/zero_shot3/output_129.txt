Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  67  26  53  17  85
1  69   4  30  90  51  95
2   7  89  25  28  43   6
3  54  49  57  99  69  29
4  34  27  69  94  30  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. This involves assigning items such that the total value each agent derives from their allocated items is as high as possible, given the constraint that each item can only be assigned to one agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 5 (85).
- Agent 1 has high values for items 3 (90) and 5 (95).
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 1 (89).
- Agent 3 has the highest value for item 3 (99).
- Agent 4 has high values for items 2 (69) and 3 (94).

By examining these values, we can make some assignments:

1. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, because Agent 1 values it the most at 95.
2. Assign item 3 to Agent 3, because Agent 3 values it the most at 99.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2, because Agent 2 values it the most at 89.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0, because it is the highest remaining value for Agent 0 at 62.
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 1, as Agent 1 values it significantly at 51.
6. Assign item 2 to Agent 4, as it is the highest value that remains for Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly, maximizing overall satisfaction.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives items in a manner that considers their valuations.
