Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13   8  11  69  85  71
1  22  18  93   6  69  30
2  31  44  35  73  38  47
3  71  53  45  21   4  63
4  21  39  97  86  70  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total satisfaction or value for all agents. One common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 3 values it the most with 71.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 3.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 3 values it the most with 53.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 3.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 4 values it the most with 97.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 4.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 2 values it the most with 73.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 2.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 0 values it the most with 85.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 0.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it the most with 71.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents in a manner that maximizes their individual valuations for the items they receive.
