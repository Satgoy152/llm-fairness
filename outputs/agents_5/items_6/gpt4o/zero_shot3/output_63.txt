Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  37  49  99  65  96
1  97  14  31  73  60  57
2  35  36  54  80  15  41
3  74  10  65  56  63  38
4  31  18  45  70  83  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on the given valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation might look:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 97.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 37.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 65.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 99.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 83.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 96.

Let's allocate the items accordingly:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3, 5
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 4

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
