Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  69  61   2  12   1
1  45   1  56  15  15  20
2  32  60  78  41  37   7
3  17  59  51  14   1   3
4  27  83  78  19  68  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and exactly 6 items are allocated overall. One common approach is to use a greedy method where we allocate items based on the highest valuations first.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0** 
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value = 97)
   - Allocation: [0]

2. **Agent 4**
   - Highest valuation (after Agent 0's allocation): Item 1 (value = 83)
   - Allocation: [1]

3. **Agent 2**
   - Highest valuation (after previous allocations): Item 2 (value = 78)
   - Allocation: [2]

4. **Agent 2**
   - Next highest valuation for remaining items: Item 3 (value = 41)
   - Allocation: [2, 3]

5. **Agent 4**
   - Next highest valuation for remaining items: Item 4 (value = 68)
   - Allocation: [1, 4]

6. **Agent 1**
   - Highest valuation for remaining items: Item 5 (value = 20)
   - Allocation: [5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
