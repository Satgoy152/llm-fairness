Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  34  45  24   4  75
1  28  31  58  52  61  83
2  18  22  96  35   2  76
3  42  90  10  58  44  26
4  75   3  20  95  66  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach by trying to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We need to allocate exactly 6 items among the 5 agents.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value items for Agent 0 are 0 (83) and 5 (75).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value items for Agent 1 are 5 (83) and 4 (61).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is 2 (96).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is 1 (90).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is 3 (95).

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets item 0
- Agent 1 gets item 5
- Agent 2 gets item 2
- Agent 3 gets item 1
- Agent 4 gets item 3

Finally, we still have item 4 left to be allocated. Looking at the remaining valuations:

- Agent 1 values item 4 at 61, which is the highest remaining valuation for this item.

Thus, allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
