Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  58  21  46  83  46
1  69  95   0  51  92  18
2  79  22  38  90  93  37
3  20  64  15  49  53  45
4  59  37  59  62   5  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6. We also consider the preferences of each agent based on the valuations given in the table. Here's a possible allocation that tries to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so item 0 is allocated to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most, so item 1 is allocated to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most, so item 4 is allocated to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most, so item 5 is allocated to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the most, but since it is already taken, we allocate item 3 to agent 4 as it is the next highest valued item for agent 4.
6. The remaining item, item 2, can be allocated to the agent with the least value currently, which is agent 1, as they only have one item, and item 2 has zero value to agent 1.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
