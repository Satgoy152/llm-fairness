Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  18  22  29  54  14
1  32   4  58  38  98   0
2   0  37  40  47  39  60
3  47  53  48  20  32   7
4  62  44   7  11  91  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[85 18 22 29 54 14]
 [32  4 58 38 98  0]
 [ 0 37 40 47 39 60]

 [62 44  7 11 91 13]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can aim to maximize the satisfaction or valuation each agent gets from the items they receive. One common approach is to use a method that considers the valuations and tries to optimize the allocation based on them.

Here's one possible fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Allocate item 4 to agent 1 because agent 1 has the highest valuation (98) for this item.
2. Allocate item 2 to agent 1 because agent 1 has the highest valuation (58) for this item.
3. Allocate item 0 to agent 0 because agent 0 has the highest valuation (85) for this item.
4. Allocate item 5 to agent 2 because agent 2 has the highest valuation (60) for this item.
5. Allocate item 1 to agent 3 because agent 3 has the highest valuation (53) for this item.
6. Allocate item 3 to agent 2 because agent 2 has the second highest valuation (47) for this item after allocations are made.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": []
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are assigned and that each agent receives the items they value most, as much as possible given the constraints.
