Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66   4  30  73  35  13
1  41  87  60  22  66  40
2  35  36  72  71  74  29
3  91  67  14  62  65  92
4  53  21  54  81  19  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items among the agents fairly, we need to consider the valuations and ensure that all items are distributed. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, one of the agents will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's consider a strategy where each agent gets the item they value the most. If there is a conflict (i.e., two agents value the same item the highest), we'll assign the item to the agent with the higher valuation and then proceed to the next highest valued item for the other agent. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (73), so assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (87), so assign item 1 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (74), so assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (92), so assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (81), but since item 3 is already assigned, assign the next highest valued item, which is item 5, to Agent 4.

After this, items 0 and 2 remain unassigned. We can assign them based on remaining highest valuations:

6. Agent 3 also values item 0 highly (91), so we assign item 0 to Agent 3.
7. Agent 2 values item 2 highly (72), so we assign item 2 to Agent 2.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [5, 0],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, with two agents receiving two items to ensure all 6 items are allocated.
