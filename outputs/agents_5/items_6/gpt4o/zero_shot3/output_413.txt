Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  54  39  99   3  68
1  59  49  55  36   9  83
2  74  92  77  46  61  78
3  52  70   9   4  84  98
4  39  46  23  27  40  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated. We can use a greedy approach where we assign the highest valued item available to each agent one by one until all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0: [7, 54, 39, 99, 3, 68]
- Agent 1: [59, 49, 55, 36, 9, 83]
- Agent 2: [74, 92, 77, 46, 61, 78]
- Agent 3: [52, 70, 9, 4, 84, 98]
- Agent 4: [39, 46, 23, 27, 40, 31]

We will proceed with allocating items based on maximizing individual agent satisfaction:

1. Assign the item with the highest valuation for Agent 0, which is item 3 (99).
2. Assign the item with the highest valuation for Agent 1, which is item 5 (83).
3. Assign the item with the highest valuation for Agent 2, which is item 1 (92).
4. Assign the item with the highest valuation for Agent 3, which is item 5 (98). Since item 5 is already allocated, assign the next highest, which is item 4 (84).
5. Assign the item with the highest valuation for Agent 4, which is item 1 (46). Since item 1 is already allocated, assign the next highest, which is item 4 (40). Since item 4 is also allocated, assign the next highest, which is item 0 (39).

Now we have allocated:
- Agent 0: item 3
- Agent 1: item 5
- Agent 2: item 1
- Agent 3: item 4
- Agent 4: item 0

Items 2 remains unallocated, so let's assign it based on the highest remaining valuation:
- Agent 2 has the highest remaining valuation for item 2 (77).

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item.
