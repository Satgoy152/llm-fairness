Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  13  47  32  41  38
1  89  48  17  74  29  85
2  55  94  90  67  22  66
3  15  56  73  97  94  93
4  91  64  80  18  95  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value that each agent receives while ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent. Each agent should receive at least one item, and all items should be allocated.

Here's a possible allocation using a simple greedy approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure each agent gets at least one item. If an agent doesn't have an item, swap items to maximize overall value until each agent has at least one item.

For this problem, let's allocate the items as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 1 (value = 89)
- Item 1: Agent 2 (value = 94)
- Item 2: Agent 2 (value = 90)
- Item 3: Agent 3 (value = 97)
- Item 4: Agent 4 (value = 95)
- Item 5: Agent 1 (value = 85)

Now let's ensure each agent gets at least one item. In this allocation, all agents except Agent 0 have received items. To fix this, we'll swap items between agents to ensure fairness:

- Swap item 5 from Agent 1 to Agent 0.

This gives us the final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Items 1, 2
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 4

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
