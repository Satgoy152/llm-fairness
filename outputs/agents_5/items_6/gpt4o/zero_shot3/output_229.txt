Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22   8   4  91  10  18
1  41  59  11  57  71  57
2  52  85  87  24  23  34
3  33   6   4  35  52  83
4  57  84  83  95  92  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to the agents, we should consider distributing the items based on maximizing the overall satisfaction or value for each agent. Let's use a greedy approach where we assign the highest value item to each agent in a round-robin manner until all items are allocated. This approach tries to ensure that each agent gets items they value highly, and the allocation is as fair as possible.

First, we'll convert the table into a list of tuples with each tuple containing (agent, item, value) for easy sorting and allocation:

```
values = [
    (0, 0, 22), (0, 1, 8), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 91), (0, 4, 10), (0, 5, 18),
    (1, 0, 41), (1, 1, 59), (1, 2, 11), (1, 3, 57), (1, 4, 71), (1, 5, 57),
    (2, 0, 52), (2, 1, 85), (2, 2, 87), (2, 3, 24), (2, 4, 23), (2, 5, 34),
    (3, 0, 33), (3, 1, 6), (3, 2, 4), (3, 3, 35), (3, 4, 52), (3, 5, 83),
    (4, 0, 57), (4, 1, 84), (4, 2, 83), (4, 3, 95), (4, 4, 92), (4, 5, 44)
]
```

Next, we sort this list in descending order based on the value:

```
sorted_values = sorted(values, key=lambda x: x[2], reverse=True)
```

Now, we'll allocate items to agents. Each agent will receive items in the order of their highest valuations, ensuring each item is allocated only once and that all items are assigned:

```python
allocations = {0: [], 1: [], 2: [], 3: [], 4: []}
allocated_items = set()

for agent, item, value in sorted_values:
    if item not in allocated_items and len(allocated_items) < 6:
        allocations[agent].append(item)
        allocated_items.add(item)
```

Finally, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving items they value highly.
