Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  36  66  23   4  80
1  71  58  54  42  46  25
2  43  64  70   9  37  39
3  86   6  89  57   1  32
4   9  82  91   9  58  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm where items are allocated one at a time to the agent who values them the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's follow this approach to allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (86), so item 0 is allocated to agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (82), so item 1 is allocated to agent 4.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (89), so item 2 is allocated to agent 3.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (57), but since agent 3 already has two items, let's consider the next highest valuation. Agent 1 has a valuation of 42, so item 3 is allocated to agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (58), so item 4 is allocated to agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (80), so item 5 is allocated to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, aiming for a fair distribution based on their valuations.
