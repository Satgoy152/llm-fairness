Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  82  85  32   5  40
1  26  15  65  22  24  63
2  98  81  53  19  65  32
3   4  26  47  12  84  42
4  19  73   1  23  60   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[17 82 85 32  5 40]
 [26 15 65 22 24 63]
 [98 81 53 19 65 32]
 [ 4 26 47 12 84 42]
 [19 73  1 23 60  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives items that have the highest value for them, while also ensuring that all items are allocated. Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives item 2 (value = 85).
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 5 (value = 63).
3. **Agent 2**: Receives item 0 (value = 98).
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 4 (value = 84).
5. **Agent 4**: Receives item 1 (value = 73).

Now, we have one item left to allocate, item 3. Let's find the agent who values it the most among those who have not received their optimal items:

- Agent 0 values item 3 at 32.
- Agent 1 values item 3 at 22.
- Agent 2 values item 3 at 19.
- Agent 3 values item 3 at 12.
- Agent 4 values item 3 at 23.

Agent 0 values item 3 the highest among the remaining options. Therefore, Agent 0 will also receive item 3.

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
