Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  12  18  21  15  70
1  46  67  14  77  14   8
2  42  91  42  69  53  38
3  63  82  48  21  87  93
4  31  28   9  47  45  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the overall valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent can receive an additional item to balance the allocation. Here is a possible allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. Assign each agent an item that they value highly.
2. Assign the remaining item to an agent that provides the highest value for it.

Let's analyze the values:

- Agent 0 has high values for items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 4 does not have particularly high values but can receive a less contested item.

Using this analysis, a possible allocation is:

- Agent 0: item 5 (value 70)
- Agent 1: item 3 (value 77)
- Agent 2: item 1 (value 91)
- Agent 3: item 4 (value 87)
- Agent 4: items 0, 2 (values 31, 9)

This ensures each agent receives at least one item and maximizes total valuation.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
