Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47   8   7   3  40  55
1  11  42  64  39  75   3
2  30  72  67  25  39  50
3  95  75  67  28  47  99
4  29  94  92   6  47  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will get 2 items while the others will each get 1 item.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the highest valued allocations**: Start by identifying the highest valuation each agent has for a particular item, and try to allocate that item to them.

2. **Ensure everyone gets at least one item**: Make sure no agent is left without an item, unless all items are fairly allocated.

3. **Optimize for fairness**: If possible, adjust allocations to ensure that no agent feels significantly disadvantaged compared to others.

Let's execute this allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 55.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 75.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest at 72.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest, but it's already taken by Agent 0, so allocate item 0 to Agent 3, valued at 95.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest, but it's already taken by Agent 2, so allocate item 2 to Agent 4, valued at 92.

Now, we have 5 items allocated. One item is left, which is item 3:

- Allocate item 3 to the agent with the least total valuation so far. Agent 1 has the least valuation with only item 4. Assign item 3 to Agent 1, which gives them an additional item.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.
