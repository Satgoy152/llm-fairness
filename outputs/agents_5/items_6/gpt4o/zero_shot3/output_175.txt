Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  40  32  10  29  37
1  38  62  70  31  16  34
2   1  11  49  53  75  18
3  87  82  87  48  65  69
4  47  19  63   3  29  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [47 19 63  3 29 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach, such as maximizing the individual satisfaction of each agent by considering their highest-valued items first. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 2 because agent 2 values it the most at 53.
2. Assign item 4 to agent 2 as well because agent 2 values it the most at 75.
3. Assign item 0 to agent 3 because agent 3 values it the most at 87.
4. Assign item 1 to agent 3 because agent 3 values it highly at 82.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 1 because agent 1 values it the most at 70.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0 because agent 0 values it the most at 37.

Now, we will present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed, and each agent receives items based on their valuations, with no agent left without consideration.
