Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  95   0  57  68   2
1  80  15  90  78  83  73
2  76  19  34   4  49  56
3  62  11  29  24  84  32
4  86  81  59  60   0  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. We'll attempt to distribute the items in a balanced manner according to the given valuations.

Here is one possible allocation of the items:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (95) compared to other agents, so we allocate item 1 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 very highly (90), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest (56), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 doesn't have any standout values, but they value item 0 (62) more than other agents, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 3 and item 4 highly and uniquely compared to others, but since item 4 is valued by Agent 0 as well, we will allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, let's check:
- Items allocated: 0, 1, 2, 3, 5.
- Item 4 is unallocated.

To ensure all items are allocated, we can assign item 4 to Agent 4 as it is the only remaining item, and Agent 4 values it differently compared to others.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are fairly distributed among the agents.
