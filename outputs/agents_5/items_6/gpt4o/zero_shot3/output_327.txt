Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  90  25   8  33  31
1  61  38  46  92  81  42
2  91  99  63  38  30  11
3  84  32  13  51  74  13
4  82  82  37  24  49  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it most. This approach ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who considers it most valuable. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most (91), so assign item 0 to agent 2.
2. Item 1: Agent 2 values it the most (99), so assign item 1 to agent 2.
3. Item 2: Agent 2 values it the most (63), so assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Item 3: Agent 1 values it the most (92), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
5. Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most (81), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
6. Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most (31), so assign item 5 to agent 0.

Based on this allocation, the JSON representation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0, 1, 2],
    "3": [],
    "4": []
}
```

This distribution ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it most, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.
