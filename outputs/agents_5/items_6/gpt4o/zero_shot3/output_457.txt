Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  30  62  32  36  38
1  44  42  24  62  15  65
2  68  37  94  21  39  50
3  19  13  30  97  87  72
4  71   7  28  65  16  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the value that each agent receives based on their valuations. We'll use a simple greedy approach by assigning items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. 

Let's start assigning the highest valued items to the respective agents:

1. Agent 2 values item 2 the most at 94.
2. Agent 3 values item 3 the most at 97.
3. Agent 1 values item 5 the most at 65.
4. Agent 4 values item 0 the most at 71.
5. Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 62, but it's already allocated. Next highest is item 0 at 41, but it's also taken. The next is item 4 at 36.

With the remaining items, we can now assign them to agents aiming to balance the allocations:

6. For item 1, Agent 1 has not received any item yet. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.

Now, let's ensure every agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated:

Reviewing the allocations so far:
- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [0]

There is one item left:
- Item 1 is left and can be given to Agent 0.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [1, 4]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [0]

Thus, the allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
