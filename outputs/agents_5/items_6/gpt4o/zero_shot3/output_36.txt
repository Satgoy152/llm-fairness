Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  69  18  66  20  93
1   3  46  27  77  65  33
2  28  56  24  68  78  55
3  57  61  57  29  44  58
4  68   9  17  21  67  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[51 69 18 66 20 93]
 [ 3 46 27 77 65 33]
 [28 56 24 68 78 55]
 [57 61 57 29 44 58]
 [68  9 17 21 67 57]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will analyze the valuations each agent has for each item. A common method for fair allocation is to use the max-min fair approach, which ensures that each agent gets at least one of their highly valued items if possible.

Given the table of valuations, I'll perform the allocation:

### Valuation Table:
```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  69  18  66  20  93
1   3  46  27  77  65  33
2  28  56  24  68  78  55
3  57  61  57  29  44  58
4  68   9  17  21  67  57
```

### Allocation Strategy:
1. Identify the highest value each agent has for any item.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item where possible.
3. If conflicts arise where two agents value an item equally, choose based on the next highest value or randomly to ensure fairness.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 4 values it at 68 (highest).
   - Assign item 0 to agent 4.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 69 (highest).
   - Assign item 1 to agent 0.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Both agent 0 and agent 3 value it at 57.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 3 to balance allocation since agent 0 already has item 1.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 77 (highest).
   - Assign item 3 to agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 78 (highest).
   - Assign item 4 to agent 2.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 93 (highest).
   - Assign item 5 to agent 0.

### Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation aims to respect the highest valuations where possible.
