Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33   2  49  83  89   5
1  98  23  48   5  26  88
2  81  52   7  29  49  62
3   3  44  56  45  17  82
4  82   8  67  28   7  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives items in a manner that maximizes their satisfaction based on their valuations. One common approach to achieve fairness is to use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent's allocated items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item wherever possible.

Given the matrix of valuations, let's proceed with an allocation that considers the highest valuations first, with the goal to maximize overall satisfaction:

1. Agent 1 strongly values item 0 (98), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.
2. Agent 0 highly values item 4 (89), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
3. Agent 4 strongly values item 5 (97), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
4. Agent 0 also highly values item 3 (83), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 (67), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
6. Agent 3 values item 1 (44), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 3.

This allocation ensures that items are distributed based on the highest individual valuations while respecting the condition that exactly six items are allocated in total.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```
