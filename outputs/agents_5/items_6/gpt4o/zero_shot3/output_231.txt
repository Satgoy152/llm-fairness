Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  47  61  90   5  55
1  15  13  35  15   6  23
2  94  89  24  30  22  88
3  76  56  28  87  28  47
4   2  78  67  20  39  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Let's also aim for each agent to receive at least one item if possible.

Here's one possible allocation approach:

1. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and adjust if necessary to make the allocation fairer.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations first:

- Item 0: Highest value is 94 by Agent 2
- Item 1: Highest value is 89 by Agent 2
- Item 2: Highest value is 67 by Agent 4
- Item 3: Highest value is 90 by Agent 0
- Item 4: Highest value is 39 by Agent 4
- Item 5: Highest value is 88 by Agent 2

Assign these items:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: (no initial allocations, needs adjustment)
- Agent 2: Items 0, 1, 5
- Agent 3: (no initial allocations, needs adjustment)
- Agent 4: Items 2, 4

To ensure all agents receive at least one item, we can adjust the allocation slightly. For instance, we can transfer item 1 from Agent 2 to Agent 1, and item 4 from Agent 4 to Agent 3:

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0, 5]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [2]

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is six.
