Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 31.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  88  56  60  45  51
1  70  10  31  84  66  77
2  73  54   5   3  26  46
3  37  72  31  29  68  32
4  46  88  64  32   0   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46 88 64 32  0  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent can get zero or more items. Here is a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - High valuation on item 1: 88
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - High valuation on item 3: 84
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - High valuation on item 0: 73
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - High valuation on item 4: 68
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - High valuation on item 2: 64
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 4

Now we have allocated 5 items. Item 5 remains unallocated. We need to find the agent who has the highest valuation for item 5:

- Valuations for item 5:
  - Agent 0: 51
  - Agent 1: 77
  - Agent 2: 46
  - Agent 3: 32
  - Agent 4: 8

The highest valuation for item 5 is from Agent 1 with a value of 77. However, Agent 1 already has item 3. We can choose another agent with the next highest valuation for item 5, which is Agent 0 with a value of 51. 

Thus, we allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents while attempting to maximize their individual valuations.
