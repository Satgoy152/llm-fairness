Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  22  90  74   7   4
1  93  67  67  91  92  17
2   9  46  46   5  15  22
3  15  92  26  41  44  38
4  23  42  31  33   5  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, wherever possible, and all items are allocated. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will get an extra item. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by finding the highest value for each agent and allocate that item to them if it hasn't been allocated yet.
2. Ensure that all agents receive at least one item.
3. Allocate the remaining items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring all items are allocated.

Based on the valuations provided, here is a fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 the most (90).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (91).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (46).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (92), but since item 1 is already allocated, they get item 4 which they value at 44.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most (86).

After the initial allocation, item 0 remains unallocated. We will assign it to the agent that values it the most among those with the least total value:

- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (93), but since they already have an item, we'll consider the other agents.
- Thus, item 0 goes to Agent 2, who values it at 9.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```
This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item where possible.
