Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  48  20  97  50  34
1   2  18  49  56  78  23
2  31   9  59  55  73  55
3  89  43  58  11  14  24
4  26  14  59  69  97  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 48 20 97 50 34]
 [ 2 18 49 56 78 23]
 [31  9 59 55 73 55]
 [89 43 58 11 14 24]
 [26 14 59 69 97 20]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can look for an allocation that maximizes total valuation for each agent. Let's proceed with this approach and assign the items:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valuation item: Item 3 (97)
   - Next highest: Item 0 (75)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation item: Item 4 (78)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation item: Item 2 (59)
   - Next highest: Item 5 (55)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation item: Item 0 (89), but already taken by Agent 0
   - Next highest: Item 2 (58), already taken by Agent 2
   - Third highest: Item 1 (43)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuation item: Item 4 (97), already taken by Agent 1
   - Next highest: Item 3 (69)

Now, let's summarize and allocate the remaining items:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Items [2, 5]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 4: No item available (since all items are already allocated)

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": []
}
```
