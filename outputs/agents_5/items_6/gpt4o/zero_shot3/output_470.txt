Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  86  15  59   9  29
1  18  75  39  44  20  29
2  37  56  22  22  13  94
3  46  13  44  62  74  57
4  44  10  69  54   9  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [44 10 69 54  9 53]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while distributing exactly 6 items among them. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Evaluate the highest valuation for each item and allocate it to the agent with the maximum value for that item.
2. Ensure that each item is allocated and each agent's allocations are balanced as fairly as possible.

Below is the allocation based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 99.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most at 69.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most at 62.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the most at 74.
- Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 94.

Based on these valuations, the allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items for which they have the highest valuation, while ensuring that all 6 items are allocated.
