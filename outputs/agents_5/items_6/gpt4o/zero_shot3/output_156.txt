Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  20  13  30  59  25
1  64  65  68  13  20  82
2  13   6  71  31  70  13
3  96  94  20  89  10  31
4  75  78  57  15  65  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider using a method that maximizes each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with at least one item if possible.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most (96). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values item 1 the most (94). Assign item 1 to agent 3.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values item 2 the most (71). Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the most (89). Assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values item 4 the most (70). Assign item 4 to agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values item 5 the most (82). Assign item 5 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, and all 6 items are distributed among the agents.

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": []
}
```
