Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  21   0  86  79  95
1  41  88  44  11  90  36
2  86  60  17  51  68  32
3  66  91  57  83  70  48
4  64  25   9  56  21  70

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations given in the table for each item and try to maximize the overall satisfaction of each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible, by adjusting the allocations.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 86 (Agent 2).
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 91 (Agent 3).
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 57 (Agent 3).
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 86 (Agent 0).
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 90 (Agent 1).
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 95 (Agent 0).

Now, we have:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 1, 2
- Agent 4: No items

Since Agent 4 has no items, we need to adjust to ensure fairness. Let's reassign one item from an agent with multiple items to Agent 4.

Reallocate:
- Transfer Item 2 from Agent 3 to Agent 4, as Agent 4 has a low valuation for items, and this transfer minimally impacts the overall satisfaction.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 3, 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 2

Here's the JSON format for the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
