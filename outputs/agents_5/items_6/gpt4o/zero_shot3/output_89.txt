Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  62  75  85  89  85
1  49  23  86  17  17  88
2  55  48  68  36  80  39
3   7  67  64  51  13  96
4  79  65  68  19   5  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes overall satisfaction by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Analyze the Valuations:** We will first identify which agent values each item the most and allocate that item to them.
2. **Ensure Fairness:** Since each agent must get at least one item and no more than two, we will adjust allocations to meet these constraints.

Let's see the highest valuation for each item:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it at 79
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it at 67
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it at 86
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 85
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it at 80
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it at 96

Based on these valuations, the initial optimal allocation would be:
- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 0
- Item 1 is unallocated

Since each agent should get at least one item, we need to reallocate to ensure fairness. Let's allocate item 1 to the agent with the next highest valuation who doesnâ€™t already have an item:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Items 1, 5
- Agent 4: Item 0

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [0]
}
```
