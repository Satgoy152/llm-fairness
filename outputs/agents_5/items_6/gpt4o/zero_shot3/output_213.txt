Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  93   1  60  54  83
1  80  88  89  56  17  60
2  80  99  43  95  90  10
3  19  80  25  49  44  67
4  72  53  57   2  92   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [80 88 89 56 17 60]
 [80 99 43 95 90 10]

 [72 53 57  2 92  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. A possible approach is to assign each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, as long as no conflicts occur. If conflicts do arise (i.e., two agents both value an item the highest), we can resolve these by considering the next highest valuation each agent has for any unallocated item. 

Let's follow this process for the given data:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 96).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 89).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 99).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 80), but it's already assigned, so next highest is item 5 (value 67).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 92).

Now, let's see the allocations so far:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 4

The only item left unallocated is item 3. Now, we need to assign this item to one of the agents. We consider the remaining valuations for item 3:

- Agent 0: 60
- Agent 1: 56
- Agent 2: 95
- Agent 3: 49
- Agent 4: 2

Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3 among those who have not been assigned it yet. Therefore, item 3 goes to Agent 2.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [2]
- Agent 2: [1, 3]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [4]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```
