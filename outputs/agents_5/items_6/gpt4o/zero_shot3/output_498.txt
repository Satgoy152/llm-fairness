Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  42   4  38   3  65
1  22  30  94  83  76  13
2  84  25  36  27  22  37
3   1  15  89  50  34  99
4  20   5  77   8  91  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the Maximum Nash Welfare (MNW) approach, which aims to maximize the product of the utilities of all agents. This often leads to a fair distribution of items, especially when each agent must receive an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 70).
- **Agent 1**: Has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 94).
- **Agent 2**: Has a relatively higher valuation for item 0 but since it's already allocated to agent 0, we consider item 5 for agent 2 (value 37).
- **Agent 3**: Has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 99), but since it's allocated to agent 2, item 3 (value 50) is the next best option.
- **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 91).

Let's revise this slightly to ensure all items are allocated fairly, considering the next highest valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 70)
2. **Agent 1**: Item 2 (value 94)
3. **Agent 2**: Item 1 (value 25)
4. **Agent 3**: Item 3 (value 50)
5. **Agent 4**: Item 4 (value 91)
6. **Agent 0**: Item 5 (value 65), since agent 0 had a strong second preference here.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed based on the highest possible valuations considering the constraints.
