Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  86  74  96  82  16
1  63  76  50  36  88  79
2  14  48  84  59  84  92
3  24  61   5  66  30  56
4  90  75  21  51  76  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for all agents. One common approach for such problems is to use a greedy algorithm, which aims to assign items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's proceed with this method:

1. Create a list of all items and their respective agent valuations.
2. Sort this list in descending order based on valuations.
3. Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item, ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

- Item 3 has the highest valuation by Agent 0 (96).
- Item 4 has the highest valuation by Agent 1 (88).
- Item 5 has the highest valuation by Agent 2 (92).
- Item 1 has the highest valuation by Agent 0 (86).
- Item 2 has the highest valuation by Agent 2 (84).
- Item 0 has the highest valuation by Agent 4 (90).

Allocations based on the above valuations:

- Agent 0: Items [3, 1]
- Agent 1: Item [4]
- Agent 2: Items [5, 2]
- Agent 3: No items assigned
- Agent 4: Item [0]

All items are allocated, and each agent receives an integer number of items. 

The allocation in the specified JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0]
}
```
