Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 17.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  51  30  23  48   7
1  12  88  17  99  11  45
2  82  31  52  77  18  27
3  39   6   8  11  91  22
4  55   0  17  40  69  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent with their allocations based on their valuations. We'll look for an allocation where each agent gets items they value more, while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (72), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (99), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (82), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 3 (77), but it's also assigned. The next highest is item 2 (52), so we allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest (91), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest (78), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Now we have one item left, item 1, which has not been allocated yet. This item should go to the agent who has not been allocated any item yet and values this item the highest:

- Agent 1 values item 1 the highest among the remaining agents without items (88), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 1.

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```
