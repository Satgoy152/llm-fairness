Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  85  82  70  71  64
1  58  39  83  66  38  83
2  16  42  34  36  46  26
3  91  61  61  86  45  96
4  15  87  93  16  36  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items. Additionally, we must allocate all six items among the five agents.

Here's one way to approach this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 0 (value 86).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 2 (value 83).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 4 (value 46).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 5 (value 96).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 2 (value 93), but since item 2 is already allocated, we choose item 1 (value 87).

Next, we need to ensure all the items are allocated. Since we have assigned items 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5, we still need to allocate item 3.

6. For item 3, let's look at the agent who values it the most among those who still have room in their allocation. Agent 3 values item 3 at 86, which is the highest among those who haven't reached their allocation limit. 

So, the final allocation can be:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 5.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.

The final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all six items are assigned and each agent receives at least one item, with a focus on maximizing each agent's valuation.
