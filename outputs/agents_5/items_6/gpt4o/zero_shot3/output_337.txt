Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  13  63  78  34  36
1  61   6  99   9  89  53
2  80  82  78  82  62  60
3  57  18  35  31  49  80
4  29  12  71  57  32  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [61  6 99  9 89 53]

 [29 12 71 57 32 69]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation of the allocated items. Let's evaluate the highest valuation each agent has for each item and allocate accordingly to ensure fairness, while also ensuring that each agent receives as close to an equal number of items as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process considering the given valuations:

1. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 99).
2. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (value 78).
3. Assign item 1 to agent 2 (value 82).
4. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 89).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 3 (value 80).
6. Assign item 0 to agent 4 (value 29).

This allocation ensures that items are distributed fairly based on their highest valuation, and each agent receives at least one item. Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation meets the requirement of assigning each item to an agent while maximizing the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.
