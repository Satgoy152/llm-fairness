Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  54  72  15  30  30
1  30  46  61  13  70  99
2   4  18  91   2  92  52
3  30  93   4  78  91  58
4  85   3  48  91  49  44

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent receives at least one item. We aim to maximize the total valuation of the items for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** The highest valuation for Agent 0 is item 0 with a value of 97. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1:** The highest valuation for Agent 1 is item 5 with a value of 99. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 4 with a value of 92. Assign item 4 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** The highest valuation for Agent 3 is item 1 with a value of 93. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:** The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 3 with a value of 91. Assign item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, we have one item left, item 2, which needs to be allocated. We will assign it to the agent with the next highest valuation for that item:

6. **Item 2:** 
   - Agent 0 values it at 72.
   - Agent 1 values it at 61.
   - Agent 2 values it at 91.
   - Agent 3 values it at 4.
   - Agent 4 values it at 48.

Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 with a value of 91. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.

The final allocation is:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
