Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  40  76  34  37  59
1   2  73  36  54  50  26
2  35  24  79   1  37  68
3  34  26  90  75  11   0
4  45  48  80  19  71  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives at least one item, and that the total number of allocated items equals the number of items available, which is 6. We also want to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations for the items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: Look at the valuations to determine which items are particularly valuable to each agent.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign each agent at least one item, focusing on items with high valuations for each agent.

3. **Refinement**: Adjust the allocation to ensure all items are allocated and no item is allocated more than once.

4. **Final Check**: Ensure that each agent has an integer number of items and that the total number of allocated items is exactly 6.

Following these steps, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 1.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 3.
- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 4.

These considerations lead to the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated.
