Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  77  87  88  60  32
1  20  39  52  49  66  42
2   8   9  74  92  85  51
3  99  82   3  36  57  35
4  22   5  79  54  19  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated. We can use a simple heuristic approach where each agent is assigned the item they value the most, provided it has not already been allocated. Here's one way to approach this:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most.
2. Ensure no item is assigned to more than one agent.
3. Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's go through the process:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 88.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 66.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest at 92, but item 3 is already taken by agent 0. Agent 2's next highest is item 4 at 85, but it's taken by agent 1. The next highest is item 2 at 74.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 the highest at 99.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 the highest at 79, but it's taken by agent 2. The next highest is item 5 at 45, which is available.

After these initial allocations, we have:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [5]

The only remaining item is item 1. We need to allocate it to one of the agents:
- Agent 0 values item 1 at 77.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 39.
- Agent 2 values item 1 at 9.
- Agent 3 values item 1 at 82.
- Agent 4 values item 1 at 5.

Agent 3 values item 1 the highest among those who don't have it yet, so they get item 1. 

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent receives items they value highly, within the constraints of the problem.
