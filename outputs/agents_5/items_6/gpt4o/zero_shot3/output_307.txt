Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82   4  51   9  23  75
1  92  17  23  79   3  71
2  50  42  99  67  75  11
3  36  47   9  91  10  76
4  38  96  64  46  21  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items, with all 6 items being allocated in total. Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the highest, so assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest, so assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest, so assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the highest, so assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the highest, so assign item 1 to agent 4.
6. For the remaining item 4, we choose the agent with the next highest valuation not already assigned an item. Agent 2 values item 4 the second highest after item 2, so assign item 4 to agent 2.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
