Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  19   6  41  35   2
1  95  65  72  51  91  99
2  52  48  85  84  97  84
3  18  91  86  11  48  90
4  12   0  88  34   4  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73 19  6 41 35  2]
 [95 65 72 51 91 99]
 [52 48 85 84 97 84]
 [18 91 86 11 48 90]
 [12  0 88 34  4 25]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy approach prioritizing the highest valuations first. Since there are 6 items and 5 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. Let's go through the allocations:

1. Identify the highest valuations and allocate them first to maximize satisfaction.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.

Here is a step-by-step allocation process:

- Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (99). Assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (97). Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (91). Assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the highest (88). Assign item 2 to agent 4.
- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (73). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- The remaining item 3 has the highest value for agent 2 (84). Assign item 3 to agent 2.

Now, let's present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
