Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  82  58  37  98   5
1  41  44  40  17   5  65
2   3  72  99  70  29  24
3  34  93  65  74  32  67
4  39   9  13  50  72  48

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [41 44 40 17  5 65]
 [ 3 72 99 70 29 24]

 [39  9 13 50 72 48]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim for maximizing the total valuation across all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 4.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 4, but it's already allocated to Agent 0, so we will consider their next highest value.

Based on this analysis, we can propose the following allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (value 98).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (value 65).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 2 (value 99).
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (value 93).
5. Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (value 50).
6. Finally, item 0 can be assigned to Agent 0 (value 8).

This allocation strategy tries to maximize the valuation for each agent based on their highest remaining preference after initial allocations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
