Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  60  69   1  27   3
1  27  60  72  77  36  49
2  63  73  18  58  87  25
3  21  21   0  13  84  74
4  60  90   2  94  38  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can use a simple method by ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We'll prioritize allocating items based on the highest valuations to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest value for item 0. Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has the highest value for item 3. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest value for item 4. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has the second highest value for item 5. Assign item 5 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest value for item 1. Assign item 1 to agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. One item remains:

6. For the remaining item 2, the highest remaining value is by agent 1. Assign item 2 to agent 1.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

Each agent has been assigned at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated.
