Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  53  56   9  42  13
1  50   4  40  25  21  63
2  81  69  46  70  38  45
3  93  33  82  17  85  27
4  41  19  49  45  15  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we consider each agent's valuation of the items and attempt to distribute the items such that the allocation is as balanced as possible according to their preferences. We aim to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents, ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item. Here's one way to perform the allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 and 2.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest.
3. Agent 2 values item 0 the highest.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 and item 4 highly.
5. Agent 4 doesn't have any extremely high valuations but can be allocated some items based on remaining availability.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Items 1 (value 53)
- Agent 1: Item 5 (value 63)
- Agent 2: Item 0 (value 81)
- Agent 3: Item 4 (value 85)
- Agent 4: Items 2 (value 49) and 3 (value 45)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items and preferences are fairly considered.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```
