Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  86  23  99  64  56
1  28  12  78  28  24  78
2  41  71  35  47  69   8
3  10  55  69  49  49  38
4  94  94   5  54  51  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed. Given the valuations, we'll attempt to allocate items based on highest value preferences of the agents.

Let's start by examining the highest valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (99).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (78).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most (71).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (69), but since item 2 is taken, next is item 1 (55).
- Agent 4 values item 0 and 1 the most (94).

We can assign items based on these preferences, ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 0 to Agent 4.
5. Assign item 5 to Agent 3, as it is the next highest available value (38 for agent 3).
6. Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as it maximizes their total value.

Now let's ensure each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed:

- Agent 0: item 3
- Agent 1: item 2
- Agent 2: item 1
- Agent 3: item 5
- Agent 4: items 0, 4

This allocation gives each agent at least one item and uses all items. Below is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
