Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88   3  71  98  93  11
1  39  56  34  14  40  56
2  44  62  18  74   5   4
3  81  60  16  59  94  26
4  71   1  44  98  39  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's highest valuation for the items and try to maximize each agent's satisfaction. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 3 the most at 98. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 1 the most at 56. Allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 1 the most at 62, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 0 at 44. Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 4 the most at 94. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 3 the most at 98, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 0 at 71, but it's already taken. The next is item 5 at 58. Allocate item 5 to Agent 4.
6. There is one item left, item 2, which hasn't been allocated yet.

Re-evaluating for the remaining item:

- **Agent 0**: Has item 3.
- **Agent 1**: Has item 1 and values item 2 at 34.
- **Agent 2**: Has item 0.
- **Agent 3**: Has item 4 and values item 2 at 16.
- **Agent 4**: Has item 5 and values item 2 at 44.

Based on the remaining valuations, allocate item 2 to Agent 4, since they value it the highest among those who haven't been allocated the most valued items.

Here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value highly and all 6 items are allocated.
