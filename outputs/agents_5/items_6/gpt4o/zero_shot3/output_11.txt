Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  48  89  36  67   2
1   1  68   0  16  72   4
2  54  31  99   2  47  33
3  40  30  11  34  61  52
4  29  21  64  74  28  89

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives. A common approach is to use a "greedy" algorithm where we allocate items based on the highest value-to-agent ratio until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how the allocation can be approached:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item across all agents.** Allocate that item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Repeat the process** until all items are allocated to ensure each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most.

Let's apply this method to the given data:

- Item 0: Highest value is 76 (Agent 0)
- Item 1: Highest value is 68 (Agent 1)
- Item 2: Highest value is 99 (Agent 2)
- Item 3: Highest value is 74 (Agent 4)
- Item 4: Highest value is 72 (Agent 1)
- Item 5: Highest value is 89 (Agent 4)

Allocating items based on the highest value for each:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets no items since it doesn't have the highest value for any item.
- Agent 4 gets items 3 and 5.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

All 6 items have been allocated appropriately.
