Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 75.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  86   4   8  83  75
1  65  19  75  20  99  22
2  52  19   5  85  65  54
3  62  68  72  27   6   5
4   1  11  47  23  78   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are assigned, and each agent can receive an integer number of items. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List each agent's highest-valued items**: 
   - Agent 0: [1(86), 4(83), 5(75)]
   - Agent 1: [4(99), 2(75), 0(65)]
   - Agent 2: [3(85), 4(65), 0(52)]
   - Agent 3: [1(68), 2(72), 0(62)]
   - Agent 4: [4(78), 2(47), 3(23)]

2. **Assign items based on highest valuation preferences, ensuring no item is duplicated**:
   - Start with the highest single valuation, which is Agent 1 for item 4 (99). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
   - Next, assign item 1 to Agent 0 since it's their highest preference (86), and no other agent competing with a higher value for it.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 2, as it's their highest preference (85) and not yet assigned.
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 3, as it's their highest preference (72) and not yet assigned.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 0, since it's their next highest preference (75) not yet assigned.
   - Lastly, assign item 0 to Agent 1, as it's their next highest preference (65) not yet assigned.

3. **Review allocations to ensure fairness and completeness**:
   - Ensure all 6 items are allocated.
   - Ensure each agent is considered.

Based on these steps, here is a fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are assigned and addresses agents' preferences to the extent possible within the constraint of integer allocations.
