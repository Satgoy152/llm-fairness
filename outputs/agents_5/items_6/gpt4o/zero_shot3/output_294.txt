Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  55  33  34  18  90
1  63  94  15  84  87  24
2  68  92  68  90  74   9
3  27  89  31  40  71  93
4  81   9  49  38  99  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring every item is assigned. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the valuations for each agent**: We have a table with 5 agents and 6 items. Each cell in the table represents the value an agent assigns to an item.

2. **Initial Assignment**: Ideally, each agent should get at least one item, but since there are more agents than items, some agents may not receive any items. We will prioritize those agents with the highest valuations for particular items.

3. **Assign Items**:
   - Find the highest value for each item and assign that item to the respective agent.
   - Ensure each item is only assigned once and that the total number of items assigned is exactly 6.

Let's proceed with assigning the items based on maximizing individual agent valuations for each item:

- **Item 0**: The highest value is 81 (Agent 4).
- **Item 1**: The highest value is 94 (Agent 1).
- **Item 2**: The highest value is 68 (Agent 2).
- **Item 3**: The highest value is 90 (Agent 2).
- **Item 4**: The highest value is 99 (Agent 4).
- **Item 5**: The highest value is 93 (Agent 3).

Allocations are as follows:

- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [0, 4]

The JSON format for the allocations is:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
