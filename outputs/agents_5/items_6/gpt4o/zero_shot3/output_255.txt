Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97   8   5  21  49  12
1  74  73  58  15  19   2
2  99  19  69  72  35  54
3  86  56  27  51  52   6
4  80  81  19  44  50  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction, given their valuations. One way to do this is by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's evaluate the highest values each agent assigns to the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 0, but since item 0 is taken, we consider the next highest value, which is item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 0, but it's taken, so we move to item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is for item 0, but it's taken, so we move to item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 1, but it's taken, so we move to item 2.

Now let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0 (since Agent 0 values it the most).
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now we have assigned 5 items, and only item 5 is left.

- Item 5 can be assigned to Agent 2, as their next highest preference is unfulfilled.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [3, 5]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [2]

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
