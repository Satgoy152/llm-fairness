Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  71  71  57  28  79
1   0  15  55  47  52  33
2  19  63  44  39  82  65
3  31  75  88  24  25  15
4  64  86  40   7  57  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim for a solution where each agent receives items that they value relatively highly, while ensuring all items are allocated. This problem resembles a variant of the "assignment problem," where we have to match items to agents.

Let's analyze the given valuations and attempt to assign items to agents, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Here's a potential allocation solution:

- Agent 0 gets item 5 (highest value for them).
- Agent 1 gets item 2 (highest value for them).
- Agent 2 gets item 4 (highest value for them).
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (highest value for them).
- Agent 4 gets item 0 (highest value for them).

This allocation leaves item 3 unallocated. To ensure fairness and complete allocation, let's consider an alternative assignment such that:

- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 4.
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 3 (next highest value for them).
- Agent 4 gets item 0.

Now all items are allocated, and each agent receives items they value highly.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and it attempts to align with the agents' highest valuations to the extent possible.
