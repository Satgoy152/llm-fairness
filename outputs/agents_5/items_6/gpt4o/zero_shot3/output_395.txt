Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  22  85  67  85  46
1  56  90  89  34  46  25
2  70  54  18  59  62  90
3  49  62   9  12  61  11
4  59  79   4   2  64  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, except in cases where it's impossible due to the total number of items relative to agents.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that each agent can get at least one item if possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (84).
2. **Item 1**: Highest valuation by Agent 1 (90).
3. **Item 2**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (85).
4. **Item 3**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (67).
5. **Item 4**: Highest valuation by Agent 0 (85).
6. **Item 5**: Highest valuation by Agent 2 (90).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an item. Agent 0 has received too many items, so we will reallocate some:

- Reassign Item 3 to Agent 4, who has a valuation of 2, to ensure they get an item.
- Reassign Item 4 to Agent 3, who has a valuation of 61, to ensure they get an item.

After reallocation, the agent distribution is:

- Agent 0 gets Items [0, 2]
- Agent 1 gets Item [1]
- Agent 2 gets Item [5]
- Agent 3 gets Item [4]
- Agent 4 gets Item [3]

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
