Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  33  24  55   5  42
1  17  66   4  64  81  16
2  28  86   6  62  79  85
3  78  62  49  15  64  25
4  56  63  72  14  82  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We need to allocate all 6 items, and since there are 5 agents, one agent will receive 2 items.

Let's approach this step-by-step:

1. **Identify high-value items for each agent**: Look for items that have a notably high value for an agent compared to others, as this may indicate a strong preference or utility for that item.
2. **Initial allocation**: Assign each agent the item for which they have the highest unique valuation, if possible.
3. **Balance remaining items**: Ensure all items are allocated, considering the overall distribution and any remaining items.

Let's examine the table and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (value 55).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value 81).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value 86).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value 78).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (value 72).

We have allocated 5 items so far, one to each agent. Now, we need to allocate the remaining one item:

- **Item 5**: This item has the highest valuation from Agent 2 (value 85), so we can assign it to Agent 2 as they already have another high-value item.

With these allocations, we have distributed all 6 items. Here is the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed among the agents.
