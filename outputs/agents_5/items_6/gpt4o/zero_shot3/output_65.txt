Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  71  65  87  78  65
1  94  45  85  20  50  45
2  17  29  14  54  28  67
3  90   8  88  25  95  24
4   8  69  70  90  67   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 8 71 65 87 78 65]
 [94 45 85 20 50 45]
 [17 29 14 54 28 67]
 [90  8 88 25 95 24]
 [ 8 69 70 90 67  4]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a simple algorithm that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. One approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most. Let's determine the best allocation based on the given valuations:

- Item 0: The highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 94.
- Item 1: The highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 71.
- Item 2: The highest valuation is by agent 3 with a value of 88.
- Item 3: The highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 87.
- Item 4: The highest valuation is by agent 3 with a value of 95.
- Item 5: The highest valuation is by agent 2 with a value of 67.

Now, let's assign these items to the agents based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0 gets items 1 and 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 4 gets no items.

The item allocation can be expressed in the requested JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": []
}
```
