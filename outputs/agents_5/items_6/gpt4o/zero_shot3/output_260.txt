Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  15  57  72  40  30
1  69  19  41  90  49  54
2  71  61  76  69  93  14
3  38  53  14  12  56   6
4  10  90  67  34   6  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [10 90 67 34  6 88]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a greedy approach, where each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most. Hereâ€™s how the allocation can be done based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 93.
   
2. Item 1: 
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 90.
   
3. Item 2: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 76.
   
4. Item 3: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 90.
   
5. Item 4: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 93.
   
6. Item 5:
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 88.

Now, let's distribute these items among the agents:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 3 gets no items as they don't have the highest valuation for any item.
- Agent 4 gets items 1 and 5.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents based on their highest valuations, and each agent is listed even if they receive no items.
