Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  57  67  74  62  38
1  63  78  52  20  85  47
2  75   3  11  24  62  25
3  70  37  36  13  54  43
4  40  86  17  77   3  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all 6 items are allocated. A common approach to this type of problem is to try maximizing the total valuation across all agents, ensuring fairness by considering each agent's preferences.

Let's examine the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [42, 57, 67, 74, 62, 38]
Agent 1: [63, 78, 52, 20, 85, 47]
Agent 2: [75, 3, 11, 24, 62, 25]
Agent 3: [70, 37, 36, 13, 54, 43]
Agent 4: [40, 86, 17, 77, 3, 78]
```

To maximize the total valuation, we should prioritize allocating items to agents based on their highest valuations. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it at 75, which is the highest valuation for this item.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it at 86, which is the highest valuation for this item.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it at 67, which is the highest valuation for this item.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it at 77, which is the highest valuation for this item.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values it at 85, which is the highest valuation for this item.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 values it at 78, which is the highest valuation for this item.

Let's allocate these items based on the highest valuations:

```
Agent 0: [2]
Agent 1: [4]
Agent 2: [0]
Agent 3: []
Agent 4: [1, 3, 5]
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, maximizing the overall satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 3, 5]
}
```
