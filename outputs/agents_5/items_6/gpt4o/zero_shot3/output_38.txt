Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  36  68  12  39  57
1  84  39  66  10  51  81
2  25  34  72  69  78  76
3  46  10  37  98  84  90
4  25  74  54  93  25  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives and ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will need to receive two items. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value item for Agent 0 is item 2 (value 68).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value item for Agent 1 is item 0 (value 84).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value item for Agent 2 is item 4 (value 78).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value item for Agent 3 is item 3 (value 98).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value item for Agent 4 is item 1 (value 74).

At this point, all agents except one have received one item, and item 5 is still unallocated:

- **Item 5**: To allocate the remaining item fairly, we'll consider who values it the most among those who might benefit from an extra item. Both Agent 1 (value 81) and Agent 3 (value 90) have high valuations for item 5. Allocating it to Agent 3 maximizes the overall distribution of value.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total value received by all agents combined.
