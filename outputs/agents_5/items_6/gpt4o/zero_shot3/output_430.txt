Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  50  83  63  47  50
1  43  76   9  85  23  72
2  26  49  81  56  73  52
3   3  41  77   6  68  27
4   0   0  38  21  78  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction by considering their valuations. One potential approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. However, we also need to ensure that each agent ends up with a fair share of items. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, most agents will receive one item, and one agent will receive two items.

Let's go through the items one by one and assign them to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring fairness in distribution:

1. **Item 0**: Valuations are [74, 43, 26, 3, 0]. Agent 0 values it the highest.
2. **Item 1**: Valuations are [50, 76, 49, 41, 0]. Agent 1 values it the highest.
3. **Item 2**: Valuations are [83, 9, 81, 77, 38]. Agent 0 values it the highest. However, since agent 0 already has item 0, we consider the next highest valuation, which is agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: Valuations are [63, 85, 56, 6, 21]. Agent 1 values it the highest. However, since agent 1 already has item 1, we consider the next highest valuation, which is agent 0. Since agent 0 also has an item, we allocate it to agent 2, who has the next highest valuation.
5. **Item 4**: Valuations are [47, 23, 73, 68, 78]. Agent 4 values it the highest.
6. **Item 5**: Valuations are [50, 72, 52, 27, 58]. Agent 1 values it the highest. However, since agent 1 has an item, we allocate it to agent 4, who has the next highest valuation.

Let's summarize the allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets items 2 and 3.
- Agent 3 gets no items.
- Agent 4 gets items 4 and 5.

Here's the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
