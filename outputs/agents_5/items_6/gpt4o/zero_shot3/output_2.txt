Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 49.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  94  24  76  89  20
1  24  75  49  97  95  96
2   1  72  66  17  95  34
3   5  35  80  28  34  28
4  56  69   8  20  15  54

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and attempt to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction. We can use a simple heuristic approach, such as assigning each item to the agent that values it the most. This approach is not guaranteed to be optimal in all cases but provides a straightforward and reasonable distribution, given the constraints.

Let's go through the items one by one:

- **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (56).
- **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (94).
- **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (80).
- **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (97).
- **Item 4**: There is a tie for the highest valuation between agents 1 and 2 (95). We can assign it to agent 1 for simplicity.
- **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (96).

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible and that the allocation remains fair and complete:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Items 3, 4, 5
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 0

Now, we can present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
