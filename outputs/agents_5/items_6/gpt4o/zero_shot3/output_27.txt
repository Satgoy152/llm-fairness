Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  33  68  13  93  26
1  97  18  45  66  72  22
2  18  86  48  75  90  90
3  52  16  57  92  20  92
4  29  56  33   9  37  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [29 56 33  9 37 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that the distribution is as balanced as possible. Here is a possible allocation that attempts to achieve this:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest.
2. Assign item 3 to agent 3, as agent 3 values it the highest.
3. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as agent 0 values it the highest.
4. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as agent 2 values it the highest.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as agent 1 values it the highest.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 4, as agent 4 values it the highest.

Now, let's present these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation should ensure that each agent receives items based on their highest valuation, while also distributing all six items.
