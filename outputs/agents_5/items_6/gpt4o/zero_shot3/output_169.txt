Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  61  38  45  49  80
1  56   2  23   1  49  82
2  65  49  60   3  73  85
3  91   6  10  18  29  48
4  76  59  84  83  16   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach to ensure that every agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

One way to do this is to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets Item 0 (value 89, highest value for Agent 0).
2. Agent 1 gets Item 5 (value 82, highest value for Agent 1).
3. Agent 2 gets Item 4 (value 73, highest value for Agent 2).
4. Agent 3 gets Item 3 (value 18, highest value for Agent 3).
5. Agent 4 gets Item 2 (value 84, highest value for Agent 4).
6. The remaining item, Item 1, can be allocated to Agent 0, as it has the next highest value for Agent 0.

Allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation distributes all 6 items and ensures that each agent receives at least one item.
