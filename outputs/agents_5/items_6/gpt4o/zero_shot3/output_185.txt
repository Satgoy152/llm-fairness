Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  12  68  66  52  45
1  17  67  28  90  38  81
2  59   0  81  38   4  73
3  62  37  11  83  37   6
4  47  49  83  87  76  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[15 12 68 66 52 45]
 [17 67 28 90 38 81]
 [59  0 81 38  4 73]
 [62 37 11 83 37  6]
 [47 49 83 87 76 72]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's total valuation of their allocated items. We can follow a greedy approach to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that all items are assigned.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is 62 by agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is 67 by agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is 83 by agent 4.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is 90 by agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is 76 by agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is 81 by agent 1.

Let's allocate these items to the agents based on the highest valuations:

- Agent 0: No items
- Agent 1: Items 1, 3, 5
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Items 2, 4

Now, we convert this allocation into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 3, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
