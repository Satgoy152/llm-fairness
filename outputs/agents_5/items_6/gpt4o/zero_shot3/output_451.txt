Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  19  30  12  59  30
1  23  23  71  52  12  67
2  41  74  45  49  61  65
3  75  14  40  85  61  64
4  84  19  14  57  67  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the overall satisfaction or valuation for each agent. We need to distribute the 6 items among the 5 agents based on their valuations, ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent and that each agent receives at least one item where possible.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** For each item, identify which agent values it the most.
2. **Assign Items Based on Valuation:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
3. **Adjust for Fairness:** Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, and adjust allocations if necessary to ensure fairness.

### Allocation Process

- **Item 0:** Agent 4 values it the most (value 84).
- **Item 1:** Agent 2 values it the most (value 74).
- **Item 2:** Agent 1 values it the most (value 71).
- **Item 3:** Agent 3 values it the most (value 85).
- **Item 4:** Agent 4 values it the most (value 67).
- **Item 5:** Agent 4 values it the most (value 97).

From this, we have:
- Agent 0 receives no items.
- Agent 1 receives item 2.
- Agent 2 receives item 1.
- Agent 3 receives item 3.
- Agent 4 receives items 0, 4, and 5.

To ensure fairness and that all agents except one receive at least one item, let's adjust the allocation slightly:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 4.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 4.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (ensuring Agent 0 receives at least one item).

### Final Allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent (except one due to the number of agents) receives at least one item, maximizing fairness based on the highest valuations.
