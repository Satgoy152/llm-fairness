Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  74  36  20  95  25
1  18  33  74  96  52  66
2  93  65  89  38   3  31
3  94  50  40   4  85  84
4  89  92  17   1  72   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated. One possible approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how we can proceed:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 94 (Agent 3).
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 92 (Agent 4).
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 89 (Agent 2).
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 96 (Agent 1).
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 95 (Agent 0).
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 84 (Agent 3).

Based on the highest valuations, the items are allocated as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 4: Item 1

Now, we can represent this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
