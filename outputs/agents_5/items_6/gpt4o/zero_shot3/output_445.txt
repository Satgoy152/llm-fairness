Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  92  80  10  31  74
1  40  49  90  32  15  65
2  67  78  33  40  94  49
3  93  17   8   3  45  21
4  42  88  51  56  42  36

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that all 6 items are distributed among the agents.

Let's consider each item and allocate it to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible, and no agent receives more than required.

1. Item 0: 
   - Highest value is 94 by agent 0.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 0.

2. Item 1: 
   - Highest value is 92 by agent 0.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 0.

3. Item 2: 
   - Highest value is 90 by agent 1.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 1.

4. Item 3:
   - Highest value is 56 by agent 4.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 4.

5. Item 4:
   - Highest value is 94 by agent 2.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 2.

6. Item 5:
   - Highest value is 74 by agent 0.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 0.

After these allocations, we have:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 1, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [2]
- Agent 2: Item [4]
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Item [3]

Here's the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3]
}
```
