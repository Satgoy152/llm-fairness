Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  43  36  29  31  57
1  25  39  56  93  75   3
2   1   0  30  52  74  16
3  53  83  69  18  11  30
4  74  58  24  75   3  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[65 43 36 29 31 57]
 [25 39 56 93 75  3]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the satisfaction for each agent by assigning them items they value highly. 

1. **Agent 0**:  
   - Values: [65, 43, 36, 29, 31, 57]
   - Highest values: item 0 (65), item 5 (57)

2. **Agent 1**:  
   - Values: [25, 39, 56, 93, 75, 3]
   - Highest values: item 3 (93), item 4 (75)

3. **Agent 2**:  
   - Values: [1, 0, 30, 52, 74, 16]
   - Highest value: item 4 (74), item 3 (52)

4. **Agent 3**:  
   - Values: [53, 83, 69, 18, 11, 30]
   - Highest value: item 1 (83), item 2 (69)

5. **Agent 4**:  
   - Values: [74, 58, 24, 75, 3, 65]
   - Highest values: item 3 (75), item 0 (74)

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it highly (65).
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it highest (83).
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it highly (69).
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it highest (93).
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it highly (74).
6. **Item 5**: Agent 0 values it highly (57).

Based on this allocation plan, here's the distribution:

- Agent 0: [0, 5]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [1, 2]
- Agent 4: []

This allocation ensures that each item goes to an agent who values it highly, maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": []
}
```
