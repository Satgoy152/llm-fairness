Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  43  28  72  16  65  41
1  35  90  70  84  72  13
2  84  81  42   9   0  34
3  30   4  82  55  97  67
4  65  49  89  65  37  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive two items.

Let's consider the highest valuations for each agent and assign items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (72)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value: Item 1 (90)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value: Item 0 (84)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value: Item 4 (97)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value: Item 2 (89), but Item 2 is already taken.
   - Next highest value: Item 3 (65)

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate one more item. Let's look at the remaining unallocated items and assign them based on the next best valuation:

- Remaining items are: Item 5
- Highest remaining valuation for Item 5 is by Agent 3 (67)

Thus, the allocations can be:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation aims to fairly distribute the items based on the highest valuations for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, and a total of six items are allocated.
