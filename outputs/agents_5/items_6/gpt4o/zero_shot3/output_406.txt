Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  10  42  63  26  77  48
1  56  43  73  58  24  40
2  49  41  99  45  65  26
3   0  67  67  82  82  73
4  61  94  57  57  10  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. This approach doesn't guarantee the absolute optimal distribution but aims for a reasonable and fair allocation. Here's one way to do it:

1. Start by assigning each agent their highest valued item.
2. Then, assign remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction (total value).

Let's go through the allocations:

- **Agent 0**: Highest value is for item 4 (77).
- **Agent 1**: Highest value is for item 2 (73).
- **Agent 2**: Highest value is for item 2, but already taken, next highest is item 0 (49).
- **Agent 3**: Highest value is for items 3 and 4 (82), choose item 3.
- **Agent 4**: Highest value is for item 1 (94).

Now, two items are left (items 5 and 2).

- Since Agent 2 already has item 0, we look at the next highest value for remaining items for other agents. Agent 0 values item 5 next highest (48).
- Agent 1 can take item 2 as a second option (73), or alternatively, we can give it to another agent based on their next highest value.

Here's one potential allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items, and all 6 items are distributed among the agents.
