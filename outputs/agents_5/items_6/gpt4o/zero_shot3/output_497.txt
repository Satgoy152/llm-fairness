Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  70  63  16  11  18
1  11  13  38  26  13  81
2  70  69  39  74   1  89
3  37  86  72  47   9  49
4  86  51  32  96  37  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  70  63  16  11  18
1  11  13  38  26  13  81
2  70  69  39  74   1  89
3  37  86  72  47   9  49
4  86  51  32  96  37  76
```

We will perform the allocation by considering the highest value each agent places on the items and ensuring no item is over-allocated.

1. Agent 0 values item 1 highly (70). Allocate item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 highly (81). Allocate item 5 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly (89), but since it's already allocated, we move to the next best, item 3 (74). Allocate item 3 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 highly (86), but since it's already allocated, allocate their next best, item 2 (72), to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 highly (96), but since it's already allocated, allocate their next best, item 0 (86), to agent 4.

Now, the allocations are such that:
- Agent 0 has item 1.
- Agent 1 has item 5.
- Agent 2 has item 3.
- Agent 3 has item 2.
- Agent 4 has item 0.

This leaves item 4 unallocated. To resolve this, we can reevaluate to ensure all items are allocated:

- Reevaluate item 4: Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (37 after item 0). Assign item 4 to agent 4.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [1]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [0, 4]

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
