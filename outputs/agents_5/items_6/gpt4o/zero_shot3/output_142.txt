Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  24   1   8  13  81
1  18  86  99  79  64   1
2  33  15  46  59  67  32
3  75  13  40   6  36  49
4  11  15   7  52  48  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. This is done by considering the individual values each agent places on the items and trying to distribute the items in a way that maximizes each agent's satisfaction. 

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 1** values item 2 the highest (99). Let’s allocate item 2 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** values item 0 the highest (95). Let’s allocate item 0 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 3** values item 0 the highest, but since it's already allocated, we consider the next highest item, which is item 5 (49). Let’s allocate item 5 to agent 3.
4. **Agent 2** values item 4 the highest (67). Let’s allocate item 4 to agent 2.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 the highest (52). Let’s allocate item 3 to agent 4.
6. Now, we need to allocate the remaining item 1. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest among the remaining agents (86), so we allocate item 1 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets items based on the highest available value they place on remaining items, while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```
