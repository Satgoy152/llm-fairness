Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  45  10  93  30  56
1  80   5  52  25  64  36
2  31  27  67  47  43  19
3  32  72  34  40  58  15
4  59  42  44  83  15   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to take into account the valuations each agent places on the items. One common method to achieve a fair allocation is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. List all the item valuations for each agent.
2. Assign the highest valued item to each agent if possible.
3. Repeat until all items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (93).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (80).
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest (67).
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest (72).
- Agent 4 values item 3 the highest (83), but since item 3 is taken, the next highest is item 0 (59), which is also taken. So, we allocate item 4 (15), the next available highest.

Now, we have the allocations for the highest valued items for each agent. Let's check and allocate the remaining items:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 are taken. The remaining items are 5.
- Assign the remaining item 5 to the agent with the next highest valuation that hasn't received any of their top choices.

After following this process, here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items (6 in total) are allocated as required.
