Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  41  79  93  78  55
1   9  11  22  62  53  38
2  91  51   7  81  12  60
3  50  62  28   2  88  49
4  65  31  41  21  67  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents based on their valuations, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item (since there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive two items).

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Allocate High-Value Items First:** Start by assigning items to agents based on the highest value they have in their respective rows.
2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item:** We need to make sure every agent receives at least one item, while maximizing their satisfaction.
3. **Assign Remaining Items:** Distribute the remaining items to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Below is one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 93.
- Agent 1 values item 3 next at 62.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the highest at 91.
- Agent 3 values item 4 the highest at 88.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the highest at 76.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and each agent has received at least one item. We have one item left to allocate (item 2), which is valued as follows:

- Agent 0: 79
- Agent 1: 22
- Agent 2: 7
- Agent 3: 28
- Agent 4: 41

Agent 0 values item 2 the highest at 79, so we allocate item 2 to agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```
