Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  90  45  80   8  32
1  16  53  52  36  49  54
2  79  52  26  35   9   7
3  93  16  75   9   0  73
4  73  97  12  98  90  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach by considering the valuations of each agent for each item. One way to achieve a fair allocation is by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's walk through the process:

1. Look at each item and determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign that item to that agent.
3. Ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- Item 0: Agent 3 values it the most with 93.
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most with 97.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most with 75.
- Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most with 98.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most with 90.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most with 73.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and no agent is left out:

- Agent 3 has been allocated items 0, 2, and 5.
- Agent 4 has been allocated items 1, 3, and 4.

No items were allocated to agents 0, 1, and 2. Since we need to ensure every agent is included in the result, we will assign empty lists to those agents.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 2, 5],
    "4": [1, 3, 4]
}
```
