Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  18  46  63  95  12
1  54  28  81  20  54  11
2  53  42  27  93   1  17
3  26  75  28  72  58  81
4  46   0  61  61  10  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [46  0 61 61 10 22]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can attempt to maximize the total value each agent receives. Given the matrix of valuations, one way to approach this is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: 18, 18, 46, 63, 95, 12
Agent 1: 54, 28, 81, 20, 54, 11
Agent 2: 53, 42, 27, 93, 1, 17
Agent 3: 26, 75, 28, 72, 58, 81
Agent 4: 46, 0, 61, 61, 10, 22
```

We assign each item to the agent who values it the most:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 54 by Agent 1.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 75 by Agent 3.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 81 by Agent 1.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 93 by Agent 2.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 95 by Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 81 by Agent 3.

Now, let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 0, 2
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 1, 5
- Agent 4: No items

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": []
}
```
