Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  52   9  45  84  11
1  71  29  79  86  14  64
2  33  52  48   6  75  27
3   2   6  21  35  41  94
4  33   5  55  51  64  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we can use a strategy to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Since we are working with a small number of agents and items, we can manually determine an allocation that evenly distributes the items in a way that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Let's consider each agent's highest valued items and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest-valued item for Agent 0 is item 0 (valuation of 93). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest-valued item for Agent 1 is item 3 (valuation of 86). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest-valued item for Agent 2 is item 4 (valuation of 75). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest-valued item for Agent 3 is item 5 (valuation of 94). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest-valued item for Agent 4 is item 5 (valuation of 67), but since item 5 is already assigned, we look for the next highest available. Assign item 2 (valuation of 55) to Agent 4.

Now we have assigned 5 items. There is one item left, item 1, which needs to be allocated:

- **Item 1**: Remaining agents who can take this item are Agent 0, Agent 1, Agent 2, and Agent 3. The highest valuation for item 1 among these agents is by Agent 0 (valuation of 52). Since Agent 0 already has one item, consider the next agent with the highest valuation who has fewer items. In this case, Agent 1 or Agent 2 could be a candidate. Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it maximizes the distribution balance and valuation (Agent 1 has valuation 29).

Now, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent has at least one item, with agents getting items they value highly where possible.
