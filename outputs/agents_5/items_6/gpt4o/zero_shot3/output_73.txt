Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  10   8   3  27  52
1  93  54  99  57  59   7
2  32  66  74  52  86  32
3  72  95   1  23  71  40
4  36   3   1  50  57  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, let's aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring an equitable distribution of items. We should ensure that each agent receives at least one item, given we have 5 agents and 6 items.

Here's a potential allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 5 (52) the most.
2. Agent 1 values item 2 (99) the most.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 (86) the most.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 (95) the most.
5. Agent 4 values item 3 (50) the most.

This leaves item 0, which Agent 1 values the most after his allocated item.

Let's allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Gets item 5.
- Agent 1: Gets items 0 and 2.
- Agent 2: Gets item 4.
- Agent 3: Gets item 1.
- Agent 4: Gets item 3.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6. The allocations maximize the agents' valuations based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
