Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  69  52   9  84   1
1  51  12  90  60  79  22
2  22  31  32  92  83  22
3   7  61   6  65  68   1
4  30  91  34   8  17  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use the concept of maximizing the minimum valuation each agent receives. This approach attempts to distribute the items in a way that ensures no agent is left with extremely low total value compared to others.

Let's analyze the situation and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valued items: 4 (84), 1 (69)
   
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valued items: 2 (90), 4 (79)

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (92), 4 (83)

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valued items: 3 (65), 4 (68)

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valued items: 1 (91), 5 (46)

Given these preferences, let's attempt to allocate items considering each agent's highest preferences:

- Agent 0 will receive item 4.
- Agent 1 will receive item 2.
- Agent 2 will receive item 3.
- Agent 3 will receive item 1.
- Agent 4 will receive item 5.

This leaves item 0 unallocated. To ensure all items are allocated, let's assign item 0 to Agent 0, since it will give them an additional item without significantly impacting other agentsâ€™ valuations.

Final Allocation:
- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 5

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
