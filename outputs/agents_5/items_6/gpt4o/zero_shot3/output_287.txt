Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  61  49  71  48  61
1  39   6  19  10  74  90
2  39   3  33  95  16  91
3  36  50  13  42  42  87
4  40  79  70  20  89  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a variety of strategies. One common method is to maximize the overall satisfaction or total value. We can start by assigning items to agents who value them the most while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Item 3** has the highest value for agent 2 with a value of 95.
2. **Item 4** has the highest value for agent 4 with a value of 89.
3. **Item 0** has the highest value for agent 0 with a value of 34.
4. **Item 1** has the highest value for agent 4 with a value of 79.
5. **Item 2** has the highest value for agent 4 with a value of 70.
6. **Item 5** has the highest value for agent 1 with a value of 90.

Now, let's ensure all agents receive a fair distribution and adjust accordingly:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: Item 1, Item 2, Item 4

This allocation maximizes the total valuation by assigning items to the agents who value them the most. Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1, 2, 4]
}
```
