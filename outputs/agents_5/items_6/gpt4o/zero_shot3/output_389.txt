Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  30  79  91   1  90
1  38  55   7  35  89   5
2  42  11  18  30  31  29
3  66  50  76  86  93  73
4  62  55  24  38  42  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives, ensuring a balanced distribution. We need to distribute exactly 6 items among the 5 agents, which means one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1 item each.

Let's consider each agent's preferences and allocate the items accordingly:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 3 with a value of 91.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 4 with a value of 89.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 0 with a value of 42.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 4 with a value of 93, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 3 with a value of 86.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 0 with a value of 62, but it's already taken. The next highest is item 1 with a value of 55.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate 1 more item. Agent 0 can take item 5 with a value of 90, which is the second highest value for them.

Here is the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 1

Now, let's format these allocations into the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
