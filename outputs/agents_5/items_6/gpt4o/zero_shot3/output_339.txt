Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  98  57  13  68  15
1   8  99   3  30  22  41
2  63  80  94  44  20  87
3  12  15  82  54  61  43
4  73  51   4  34  50  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach to maximize the total valuation for each agent. One common method is to allocate items based on the highest individual valuations, ensuring each item is assigned to the agent who values it most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. This approach does not guarantee an absolutely fair allocation in terms of distribution but attempts to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (89). Assign to Agent 0.
2. Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (99). Assign to Agent 1.
3. Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (94). Assign to Agent 2.
4. Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (54). Assign to Agent 3.
5. Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (68). Assign to Agent 0.
6. Item 5: Highest valuation is by Agent 2 (87). Assign to Agent 2.

Now, let's verify the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 4
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Items 2, 5
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: No items

This allocation ensures each item is allocated based on the highest valuation, and each agent is considered. Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation satisfies the condition that only and at least 6 items are allocated in total.
