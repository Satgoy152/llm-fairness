Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  19  84  35  81  17
1  36  93   5  75   3  75
2  27   2  78  25  65  90
3  97  87  55  19  42  85
4  54  30  35  52  69  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [54 30 35 52 69 64]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and ensure that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6. We also want to ensure that the allocations are made in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction or valuation across all agents.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (84), so let's allocate item 2 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (93), so let's allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5 highly (90), so let's allocate item 5 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly (97), so let's allocate item 0 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly (69), so let's allocate item 4 to agent 4.
- We still need to allocate item 3. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 3 (75), so it seems fair to allocate item 3 to agent 1.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and maximizes the total valuation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
