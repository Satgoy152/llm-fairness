Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  83  90  86  24   4
1   3  68  70  84   0  78
2  13  43  28  96   7  49
3  71  50  39  60   6  75
4  34  96  34  75  42  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we want to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6. One possible approach is to maximize the total value of items assigned to each agent.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (value 90)
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 (value 78)
- Assign item 3 to agent 2 (value 96)
- Assign item 0 to agent 3 (value 71)
- Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 96)
- Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value 42)

This allocation provides each agent with at least one item and maximizes their respective values, given the constraints.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed fairly, with no agent being left without an item, and every item being allocated.
