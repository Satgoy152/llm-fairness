Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  26  43  10  79  20
1  87  24  54  62  13  28
2  57  93  88  92  64  29
3  23  79  56  22  64  12
4  88   0  92  60  18  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 5 agents, we need to consider their valuations for each item and try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. Here, we'll aim for a fair distribution based on the preferences of the agents.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values item 4 the highest at 79.
   - Next highest value is item 2 at 43.
   - Could be best to allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Values item 0 the highest at 87.
   - Next highest value is item 3 at 62.
   - Could be best to allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Values item 1 the highest at 93.
   - Next highest value is item 3 at 92.
   - Could be best to allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Values item 1 the highest at 79.
   - Next highest value is item 4 at 64.
   - Could be best to allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Values item 2 the highest at 92.
   - Next highest value is item 0 at 88.
   - Could be best to allocate item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, each agent has been allocated one item based on their highest or second highest preference. We still have the following unallocated items: 5.

To complete the allocation, let's see who values the remaining item the most:

- **Item 5**:
  - Agent 0 values at 20
  - Agent 1 values at 28
  - Agent 2 values at 29
  - Agent 3 values at 12
  - Agent 4 values at 86

Since Agent 4 values item 5 the highest, allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```
