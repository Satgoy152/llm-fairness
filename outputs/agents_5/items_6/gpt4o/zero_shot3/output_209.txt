Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  60  44  75  32  99
1  52  16  23  85  75  32
2  53  46  77   5  67  24
3  45  78  41  70  46  31
4  88  92   6  77  37   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that every agent gets at least one item and that the distribution considers the valuations each agent has for the items. We will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives by choosing the items they value most.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. Evaluate the highest valuation each agent has for any item.
2. Assign each agent the item with their highest valuation, provided it has not been already assigned.
3. If there are unassigned items, assign these to agents based on their next highest valuations.

Let's determine the allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the highest at 99.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest at 85.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 77.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the highest at 78.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest at 92, but item 1 is already taken by agent 3. The next highest is item 0 at 88.

Now, all agents have one item, and we have assigned 5 items. We have one more item to allocate.

The remaining unallocated item is item 4. We will assign this item based on the highest remaining valuation:

- Agent 0: 32
- Agent 1: 75
- Agent 2: 67
- Agent 3: 46
- Agent 4: 37

Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 4, so we assign it to them.

Here are the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.
