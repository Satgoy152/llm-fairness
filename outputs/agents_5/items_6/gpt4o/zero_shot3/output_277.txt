Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32   8  64  28  74  67
1  42  72  27  90  70   1
2  10  19   2  95  64  58
3  26   9  18  64  99  80
4  32  63  78  67  26  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To ensure a fair allocation of items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for each item. One common approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total valuation or ensuring that each agent receives the items they value the most, while still distributing all items.

Here is a possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's total valuation:

- Agent 0 values item 4 highly (74).
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly (90).
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly, but it's already taken by agent 1, so we can consider item 5 (58).
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly, but it's already taken by agent 0, so we consider item 5, but it's already taken, so we consider item 3, but it's already taken, finally we consider item 0 (26).
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly (78).

Now, we need to make sure all items are allocated. Let's fill in the gaps considering remaining items and their values to agents.

Here is an allocation that ensures all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [3, 1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [2]

Thus, the JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents with consideration to their valuations.
