Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  62  91  22  53  28  72
1  57  59  41   0  80   4
2  59  52  90  60  33  67
3  28  99  85  46  45  57
4  11  61  11  13  92  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize overall satisfaction by attempting to assign items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of the items. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, we can distribute items such that some agents get more items than others, but the overall distribution should aim for fairness.

After reviewing the valuations, a possible allocation is as follows:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly (91) and item 5 (72).
- Agent 1 values item 4 highly (80).
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly (90).
- Agent 3 values item 1 highly (99), but since item 1 is already allocated to Agent 0, we look for the next best option.
- Agent 4 values item 4 (92) highly, but since item 4 is already allocated to Agent 1, we look for the next best option.

Considering these observations, here's a fair allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

This allocation distributes all 6 items among the agents, ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Thus, the JSON representation of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
