Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  93  20  61   1  67
1  88  27   6  14  67  42
2  93  98  35  65  67  47
3  69  12  10  62  25  10
4  16  19  51  37  96  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim for a balanced allocation of value, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to do it:

1. Evaluate the highest value item for each agent and assign it if it hasn't been taken.
2. Continue this process while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, and no item is allocated more than once.
3. Balance the remaining items based on the next highest valuations, ensuring all items are allocated.

Following this approach, here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the highest (93).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (88).
- Agent 2 values item 1 the highest (98) but since it's already taken, item 0 is next (93).
- Agent 3 values item 0 the highest (69) but since it's already taken, item 3 is next (62).
- Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (96).

From this point, distribute the remaining items considering the remaining highest valuations:

- Agent 0 also values item 5 highly (67).
- Agent 1 could take item 4 (67).
- Agent 2 could take item 2 (35).
- Agent 3 could take item 2 (10) but since it's taken, item 5 is next (10).
- Agent 4 could take item 3 (37).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": []
}
```

Here, all 6 items are allocated, with each agent receiving at least one item, except for agent 4 who doesn't get an item due to lower valuations. Adjustments can be made if a different fairness criterion is preferred, such as ensuring each agent gets at least one item.
