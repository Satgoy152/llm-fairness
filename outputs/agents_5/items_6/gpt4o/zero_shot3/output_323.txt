Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  88  40  18  65  49
1  20  15  73  86  23  54
2  56  24  20  77   0  47
3  60   4  32  50  88  95
4  90  80  69  43  28  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents, we can consider using a method such as maximizing the total value of items each agent receives, or ensuring each agent gets at least one item with a value they consider relatively high. Given the constraints, below is a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (88) and 4 (65).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (86) and 2 (73).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (77).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (95) and 4 (88).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (90).

Allocating based on highest values while ensuring each agent gets a fair share:

- **Agent 0**: Items 1 (88)
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (73)
- **Agent 2**: Item 3 (77)
- **Agent 3**: Items 4 (88) and 5 (95)
- **Agent 4**: Item 0 (90)

This allocation maximizes each agent's high-value items and ensures all items are distributed.

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": [0]
}
```
