Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46  63  25  84  81  15
1  83  54  36  16  98  44
2  69  70  95  62  43  35
3   0  73  59  55  99  77
4  20  54  84  39  30  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction with the items they receive. This generally involves assigning items to agents who value them most highly, while ensuring that each agent receives a reasonable share of the total value.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **List the Items and Their Valuations**: For each item, list the values that each agent assigns to it.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation**: Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no agent receives more than one item until all agents have had a chance to receive one.

3. **Continue Allocation**: If some agents have not received any items, continue assigning the remaining items based on the next highest valuations.

4. **Ensure Fairness**: Check the allocations to ensure that each agent receives a fair number of items, and make adjustments if necessary.

Following this method, here's one possible fair allocation of the items:

- Item 0 (highest value by agent 1): Assign to agent 1
- Item 1 (highest value by agent 3): Assign to agent 3
- Item 2 (highest value by agent 2): Assign to agent 2
- Item 3 (highest value by agent 0): Assign to agent 0
- Item 4 (highest value by agent 3): Assign to agent 3
- Item 5 (highest value by agent 4): Assign to agent 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 gets item 3.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.
