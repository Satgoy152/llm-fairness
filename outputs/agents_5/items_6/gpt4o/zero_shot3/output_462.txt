Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  16  44  26  64  39
1  20  96  14  89  56  47
2  44   4  62  74  63  54
3  55  55  21   2  65  37
4  50  47  24   3  74  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total value perceived by each agent is balanced as much as possible. Here's a possible approach to achieve this:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation for Each Item Across All Agents**: We sum up each column to see how much value each item contributes to the total pool. This helps us understand which items are generally more valuable to the group.

2. **Greedy Allocation**: Start allocating items to agents based on the highest value they assign to the remaining items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Balance the Allocation**: Adjust the allocation to ensure a fair distribution of total value among agents, trying to keep their perceived total value as close as possible.

After performing these steps, here is a possible fair allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives item 0, which they value highly.
- Agent 1 receives item 1, where they have the highest valuation across all agents.
- Agent 2 receives item 3, which they value significantly.
- Agent 3 receives item 4, having a relatively high value for it.
- Agent 4 receives items 2 and 5, balancing out the total perceived value across agents.

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of allocated items equals six.
