Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  53  14  47   4  20
1   4  64  87  64  79  69
2  78   8  47  32  33  18
3   0  52  40  96  63  65
4  98  37   9  79  69  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuations while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and exactly 6 items are allocated in total. A common approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, or alternatively, a "greedy" approach where we prioritize assignments based on valuations while ensuring fairness.

Let's analyze the given valuations and assign the items:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 1, as they value it highly at 79.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 4, as they value it the highest at 98.
3. Assign item 3 to agent 3, as they value it the highest at 96.
4. Assign item 1 to agent 0, as they value it at 53, and this item hasn't been assigned yet.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 1, as they value it the highest at 87.
6. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as they value it at 65, and it hasn't been assigned yet.

This results in the following allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 1.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 4.
- Agent 2 gets no items.
- Agent 3 gets items 3 and 5.
- Agent 4 gets item 0.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair chance at high-valued items based on their preferences, and exactly 6 items are allocated in total.
