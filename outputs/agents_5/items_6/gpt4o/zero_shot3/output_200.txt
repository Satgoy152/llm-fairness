Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  63  23  75  85  77
1  89  89  41  13  72  27
2  24  97  11  82  10  45
3  51  39   9  35  72  16
4  28  83  86  59  99  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a strategy that attempts to maximize the satisfaction or total value for each agent, while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 4 with a value of 85.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 0 with a value of 89 (tied with item 1, but we choose item 0 to diversify allocations).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 1 with a value of 97.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 4, but it's already taken, so we choose item 0 with a value of 51.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 4 with a value of 99, but it is taken; the next highest is item 5 with a value of 82.

Now, we need to reconsider because some items are duplicated in allocation. Adjusting to ensure all items are allocated without duplication:

1. **Agent 0**: Gets item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Gets item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Gets item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: Gets item 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Gets items 2 and 5.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, taking into account their preferences as closely as possible while keeping allocations integer and unique per item.
