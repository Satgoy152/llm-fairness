Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  60  37   1  56  29
1  98  20   8  67  63   4
2  36  45  46   9  50   2
3  58  78  23  65   9  99
4  97  47  47  21  99  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[22 60 37  1 56 29]
 [98 20  8 67 63  4]
 [36 45 46  9 50  2]
 [58 78 23 65  9 99]
 [97 47 47 21 99 68]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent. Below is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**  
   - Value of items: [22, 60, 37, 1, 56, 29]  
   - Highest value item: Item 1 with a value of 60  

2. **Agent 1:**  
   - Value of items: [98, 20, 8, 67, 63, 4]  
   - Highest value item: Item 0 with a value of 98  

3. **Agent 2:**  
   - Value of items: [36, 45, 46, 9, 50, 2]  
   - Highest value item: Item 2 with a value of 46  

4. **Agent 3:**  
   - Value of items: [58, 78, 23, 65, 9, 99]  
   - Highest value item: Item 5 with a value of 99  

5. **Agent 4:**  
   - Value of items: [97, 47, 47, 21, 99, 68]  
   - Highest value item: Item 4 with a value of 99  

Now, each agent has been allocated one item based on the highest value they have for an unallocated item. We need to allocate one more item to complete the allocation of 6 items. 

Agent 4's next highest value is for item 0, but that's already allocated. The next highest unallocated item is item 3 for agent 3 with a value of 65.

Therefore, the final allocation will be:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
