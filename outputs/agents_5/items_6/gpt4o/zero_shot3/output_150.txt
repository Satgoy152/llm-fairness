Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  68  92  65  51  72
1  45  32  50  99  46  36
2  60  29  82  12  42  90
3  55  96  92   5  11  66
4  94  70  39  54  65  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. We need to consider the valuations provided for each item by the agents and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction or utility. Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given values:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Agent 0 has high valuations for items 2 and 5. Therefore, we can allocate item 2 (value 92) and item 5 (value 72) to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 99). Therefore, we can allocate item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 90), but it is already allocated to agent 0. The next highest is item 0 (value 60). Therefore, we can allocate item 0 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 1 (value 96). Therefore, we can allocate item 1 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 94), but it is already allocated to agent 2. The next highest is item 4 (value 65). Therefore, we can allocate item 4 to agent 4.

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on maximizing their valuations while distributing all 6 items.
