Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  95   4  19  25  73
1  30  77  80   2  21  26
2  68  34  60  39  42  72
3   6  44  64  69  78  76
4   4  49  44  79  86  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 4 49 44 79 86 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, we can use a simple allocation strategy that maximizes total agent satisfaction. This means trying to assign items to agents based on their highest valuations. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value = 94).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 0 (value = 95).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value = 80).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value = 79).
5. Assign item 4 to agent 4 (value = 86).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value = 72).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, thereby maximizing the total satisfaction. Let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
