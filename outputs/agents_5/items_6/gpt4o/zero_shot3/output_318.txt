Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 8.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  15  97  94  26  93
1  54  25   8   7  73  83
2  62  66  25  29  80  98
3  19  21  88  57  35  12
4  27  66  89   0  44  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations given in the table. A fair allocation could be interpreted in different ways, such as maximizing the total satisfaction or ensuring each agent receives an equitable share.

Let's try to allocate these items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences:

1. Agent 0 values item 2 and item 3 highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 and item 5 highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 highly.
5. Agent 4 values items 2 and 5 highly.

Given that each agent should receive at least one item and based on the preferences, a fair allocation might be:

- Agent 0 receives item 3.
- Agent 1 receives item 4.
- Agent 2 receives item 5.
- Agent 3 receives item 2.
- Agent 4 receives item 0 and item 1.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and tries to give each agent items they highly value, while distributing all items.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```
