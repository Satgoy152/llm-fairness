Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  37  67  65  15  64
1   3  83  48  56  13  66
2  77  87  66  45  36  28
3   5  57  67  11  72   0
4  27  78  83  93  43   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that attempts to maximize the total valuation across all agents. One strategy is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most. We'll go through each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item. Let's do this step-by-step for each item:

1. **Item 0**:  
   - Agent 0: 7
   - Agent 1: 3
   - Agent 2: 77
   - Agent 3: 5
   - Agent 4: 27  
   **Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2** (highest valuation is 77)

2. **Item 1**:  
   - Agent 0: 37
   - Agent 1: 83
   - Agent 2: 87
   - Agent 3: 57
   - Agent 4: 78  
   **Allocate Item 1 to Agent 2** (highest valuation is 87)

3. **Item 2**:  
   - Agent 0: 67
   - Agent 1: 48
   - Agent 2: 66
   - Agent 3: 67
   - Agent 4: 83  
   **Allocate Item 2 to Agent 4** (highest valuation is 83)

4. **Item 3**:  
   - Agent 0: 65
   - Agent 1: 56
   - Agent 2: 45
   - Agent 3: 11
   - Agent 4: 93  
   **Allocate Item 3 to Agent 4** (highest valuation is 93)

5. **Item 4**:  
   - Agent 0: 15
   - Agent 1: 13
   - Agent 2: 36
   - Agent 3: 72
   - Agent 4: 43  
   **Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3** (highest valuation is 72)

6. **Item 5**:  
   - Agent 0: 64
   - Agent 1: 66
   - Agent 2: 28
   - Agent 3: 0
   - Agent 4: 4  
   **Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1** (highest valuation is 66)

Now let's format these allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.
