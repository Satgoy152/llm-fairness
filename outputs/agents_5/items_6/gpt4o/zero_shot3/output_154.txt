Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  46   2  45  54  98
1  71  52  70  47  46  66
2  52  22  37   6  31  79
3  97  63  53  49  42  17
4  82  44  74  34  23  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items, aiming to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. A fair allocation does not necessarily mean each agent receives an equal number of items, but rather, it considers the overall preferences.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. **Assess the highest value each agent places on the items.**
2. **Try to allocate items based on the highest values to maximize overall satisfaction.**

Following these steps, we can create an allocation plan:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most, so allocate item 5 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most, so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 5, but since it is already taken, the next highest item they value is item 0, allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most, but since it is already taken, the next highest valued item is item 3, allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2, but since it is already taken, the next highest item they value is item 4, allocate item 4 to agent 4.

After this initial allocation, the remaining unallocated item is item 1. We need to find the best fit for this item:

- Agent 0 values item 1 as 46.
- Agent 1 values item 1 as 52 (highest among remaining).
- Agent 2 values item 1 as 22.
- Agent 3 values item 1 as 63.
- Agent 4 values item 1 as 44.

Agent 3 values item 1 the most of those remaining, so allocate item 1 to agent 3.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Items 3 and 1
- Agent 4: Item 4

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
