Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77   6  87  74   3  28
1  38  33  89  36  43  58
2  84  58  77  48  62  39
3  65  86  77   9  31  49
4  33  66  76  94  81  42

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we must consider the valuations that each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated. Given the valuations, we can follow these steps to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is for item 2 (87). Let's allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is for item 2 (89), but it's already taken. The next highest is item 5 (58). Let's allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is item 0 (84). Let's allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is for item 1 (86). Let's allocate item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is item 3 (94). Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Now, every agent except Agent 1 has one item. We have one item left, item 4, which needs to be allocated. We should allocate it to the agent who would benefit the most from it. The valuations for item 4 are:

- Agent 0: 3
- Agent 1: 43
- Agent 2: 62
- Agent 3: 31
- Agent 4: 81

Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 4 (81) and would benefit the most from it. Therefore, we allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and the total number of items allocated is 6.
