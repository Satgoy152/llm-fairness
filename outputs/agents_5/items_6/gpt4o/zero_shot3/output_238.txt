Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  61  77  43  81  70
1  49  61   4  60  74  62
2  84  24  70  13  46  94
3  68  81  88  51  74  86
4  66  80  78   1  47  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that maximizes the total value received by each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Here's one potential allocation approach:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

- **Item 0**: Highest value is by agent 2 (value 84).
- **Item 1**: Highest value is by agent 3 (value 81).
- **Item 2**: Highest value is by agent 3 (value 88).
- **Item 3**: Highest value is by agent 0 (value 43).
- **Item 4**: Highest value is by agent 0 (value 81).
- **Item 5**: Highest value is by agent 2 (value 94).

Now, we check the distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: None
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: Items 1, 2
- Agent 4: None

Agent 1 and Agent 4 have no items. We need to adjust the allocation to ensure fairness by giving each agent at least one item.

To adjust, we can give:

- Move item 3 from agent 0 to agent 1 (agent 1 values it at 60, which is the highest after agent 0).
- Move item 4 from agent 0 to agent 4 (agent 4 values it at 47, which is the highest after agent 0).

The final allocation is:

- Agent 0: None
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Items 0, 5
- Agent 3: Items 1, 2
- Agent 4: Item 4

Now, all agents have at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Here is the final allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
