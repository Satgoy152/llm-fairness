Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17   8  58  46  26  64
1   7  81   5  59   5  36
2  40  69  63  15  54  76
3  95  76  69  58  19  16
4  18  24  91  30  96  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple allocation strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction by focusing on their highest valued items first. We'll proceed with the allocation to ensure that each agent gets at least one item and all six items are distributed:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 5 (64) and 2 (58).
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 (81) the most.
3. **Agent 2** values item 5 (76) the most but also item 2 (63).
4. **Agent 3** values item 0 (95) the most.
5. **Agent 4** values item 4 (96) the most.

Starting with the highest value for each agent and ensuring no item is doubly allocated:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0 as it's their highest value item.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 as it's their highest value item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 since item 5 is already taken, and item 2 is their next highest value.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 as it's their highest value item.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4 as it's their highest value item.

Now, we have assigned 5 items, and we need to allocate the last remaining item (item 3):

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0, who has the next highest valuation for it (46).

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and all items are distributed fairly based on the preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
