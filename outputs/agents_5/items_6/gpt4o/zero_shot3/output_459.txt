Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  34  26  95  64   4
1  29   6  41  85  45  25
2  28  14  64  84  39  52
3  45  29   7  92  33  45
4  59  64  68   2  26  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations. We have 5 agents and 6 items, so one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: High valuation for item 3 (95). Assign item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: High valuation for item 2 (41). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: High valuation for item 5 (52). Assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: High valuation for item 0 (45). Assign item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: High valuation for item 1 (64). Assign item 1 to agent 4.

Now, we have one item left, item 4, which we need to distribute fairly. Since agent 0 received an item with the highest valuation (95), let's consider other agents for item 4. 

Agent 1 has a reasonable valuation for item 4 (45), so we can assign item 4 to agent 1.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their valuations, with a preference towards items they value highly, while ensuring all items are distributed.
