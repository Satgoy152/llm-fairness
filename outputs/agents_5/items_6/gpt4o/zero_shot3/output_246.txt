Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  91  55  21  29  68  96
1  35  17  52   0  42   1
2  89  68   4  78  93  61
3  47  57  82   1  25  75
4  19  13  31  55  37  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach is to utilize a max-min fairness strategy, which attempts to distribute items such that the agent with the lowest total valuation gets their allocation increased.

Let's evaluate each agent's interest in each item and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** values items highly, particularly item 5.
2. **Agent 1** has a unique preference for item 2.
3. **Agent 2** values item 4 highly.
4. **Agent 3** has a significant interest in item 2.
5. **Agent 4** seems to have the lowest valuation across the board.

Given these observations, let's try to allocate the items:

- **Item 5** is highly valued by Agent 0, so allocate item 5 to Agent 0.
- **Item 2** is uniquely valued by Agent 1, so allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
- **Item 4** is highly valued by Agent 2, so allocate item 4 to Agent 2.
- **Item 3** is not highly valued by any agent but can be given to Agent 4 who has lower overall preferences.
- **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 0 but to balance things, we can give it to Agent 3 who values it decently.
- **Item 1** can be given to Agent 2 who values it decently while already having a high-value item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4, 1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

Each agent gets a fair share based on their valuation preferences, ensuring all items are allocated.
