Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  52  46   1  47  68
1   2  80  43  93   4  68
2   7  44  30  41  90   9
3  23  96  58  70  69  48
4  58   4  48  96   0  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

 [ 7 44 30 41 90  9]

 [58  4 48 96  0 58]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated.

One possible approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent, ensuring each item is only assigned once. Let's work through this:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations are for items 5 (68), 0 (56), and 1 (52). Assign item 5 to maximize Agent 0's satisfaction.
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (93), 1 (80), and 5 (68). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuations are for items 4 (90), 1 (44), and 3 (41). Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuations are for items 1 (96), 3 (70), and 2 (58). Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuations are for items 3 (96), 0 (58), and 5 (58). Since items 3 and 1 are taken, assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, we allocate the remaining items:

- **Items Allocated**: 5, 3, 4, 1, 0.
- **Remaining Items**: 2.

To finalize the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Already has item 5.
- **Agent 1**: Already has item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Already has item 4.
- **Agent 3**: Already has item 1.
- **Agent 4**: Has item 0, allocate remaining item 2 to Agent 4 to ensure all items are allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
