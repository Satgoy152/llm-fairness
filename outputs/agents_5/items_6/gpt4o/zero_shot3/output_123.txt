Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58   3  54  13   8  19
1  41  32  68  94  50  72
2  40  48  59  63  95  76
3  65  12   9  61  37  24
4  14  97  60   2  12  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy where we try to maximize the overall satisfaction or total valuation of the items by the agents. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item where possible.

Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is from Agent 3 (value 65).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is from Agent 4 (value 97).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is from Agent 1 (value 68).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is from Agent 1 (value 94).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is from Agent 2 (value 95).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is from Agent 2 (value 76).

Now, let's ensure that each agent receives at least one item and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0 currently receives no items. We can consider reallocating an item to Agent 0, but given that reallocating would reduce the total satisfaction, and only one agent (Agent 0) is without items, we will proceed with this allocation as it maximizes total satisfaction.

The final allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and maximizes the total valuation.
