Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1   5  38  88  90  16
1  61   5  38   0  76  91
2  20  25  60  64  55  93
3  81  12  76  74  73  40
4  18  32  84  18  87   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets at least one integer number of items and all items are allocated, we can follow a strategy such as maximizing the total valuation for each agent.

Given the valuations, we can use the following greedy approach:
1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.
2. If an agent gets more than one item, check if reallocating any of those items to another agent (who hasn't received any items yet) would still satisfy their needs and increase fairness.

Here is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- Assign item 3 to agent 0 since agent 0 values it the most (88).
- Assign item 5 to agent 2 since agent 2 values it the most (93).
- Assign item 1 to agent 4 since agent 4 values it the most (32).
- Assign item 0 to agent 3 since agent 3 values it the most (81).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1 since agent 1 values it second most (76) and agent 4 already has an item.
- Assign item 2 to agent 4 since agent 4 values it the most (84).

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.
