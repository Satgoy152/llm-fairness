Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  32  96   1  96  48
1  73  17  34  53  71  69
2  22  99  23  83  58  65
3  38  53  38  21  95  19
4  42  24  46  98  12   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, and no item is allocated to more than one agent. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify High-Value Allocations**: Assign items to agents where their valuation is significantly higher compared to others.
2. **Ensure Fair Distribution**: Each agent should receive at least one item.
3. **Maximize Total Valuation**: Try to ensure that the total value assigned to each agent is as high as possible.

Let's start by looking at the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76  32  96   1  96  48
1  73  17  34  53  71  69
2  22  99  23  83  58  65
3  38  53  38  21  95  19
4  42  24  46  98  12   5
```

**Allocation Strategy:**

- **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 2 and 4 (both valued at 96). Let's assign item 2 since it is less valuable to others.
- **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 0 (valued at 73).
- **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 (valued at 99).
- **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 4 (valued at 95).
- **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 3 (valued at 98).

Now, only one item (5) is left unallocated. We can assign it to the agent who values it the most and hasn't already received an item with a comparable value.

- **Agent 1**: Assign item 5 (valued at 69), as itâ€™s the next highest value for them after item 0.

**Allocations:**

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and items are distributed respecting their valuation preferences.
