Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98  22  81  51  31  76
1  38  17  27  10  98  24
2  99  70  21  66  38  80
3  59  90  46  74  88  39
4  37  31  26  61  59  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[98 22 81 51 31 76]
 [38 17 27 10 98 24]
 [99 70 21 66 38 80]
 [59 90 46 74 88 39]
 [37 31 26 61 59 66]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the rest will receive 1 item each.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (98) and item 2 (81). Let's assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 4 (98). Let's assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 highly values item 0 (99), but since it's already taken, the next highest valuation is for item 5 (80). Let's assign item 5 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 highly values item 1 (90). Let's assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4's highest valuation is for item 3 (61). Let's assign item 3 to agent 4.

Now, one item (item 2) remains unassigned. We can assign it to the agent who will benefit the most without exceeding one additional item for that agent. Agent 0 values item 2 at 81, which is the highest available valuation for this item among all agents. Since agent 0 currently has one item, they can receive an additional item.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
