Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  59  43  68  99  72
1  34  51  69  62  81  63
2   5  40  11  48  25  45
3  30   5  22   0  19  40
4  99  37  77   8  79  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items from the table are allocated exactly once. The allocation should be made such that the distribution is as balanced as possible given the available valuations.

Here is the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: With the highest valuation for item 4 (99), allocate item 4 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The next highest remaining valuation is agent 1 for item 2 (69), allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 4**: Allocate item 0 to agent 4, as they value it the most (99).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocate item 5 to agent 3, as agent 3 has a relatively high valuation (40) compared to their other options.
5. **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 to agent 2, as agent 2 has a higher valuation for it (48) than for any other remaining item.
6. **Agent 1**: Allocate item 1 to agent 1, as they value it more (51) than any remaining agent.

Based on this allocation strategy, the items are distributed fairly among the agents based on their valuations. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

Each agent has been assigned a number of items, and all 6 items have been distributed.
