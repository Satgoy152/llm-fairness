Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 25.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48   5  84  38  80  57
1  63  68  25  39  62  85
2  83  45  21   3  37   8
3  73  42  50  50   8  91
4  71  71  82  89  77  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuation each agent gets while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the highest valuations per item**: We want to assign items to agents who value them the most to maximize fairness and satisfaction.

2. **Allocate items**:
   - Item 0: Agent 2 values it the most with 83.
   - Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with 68.
   - Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most with 84.
   - Item 3: Agent 4 values it the most with 89.
   - Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most with 80.
   - Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most with 91.

3. **Check allocations**: Ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible. Adjust if necessary to meet any fairness criteria.

4. **Adjustments**: If any agent receives no items, consider swapping items to ensure that each agent receives at least one, if possible.

After following the above steps, here is a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of allocated items is exactly 6.
