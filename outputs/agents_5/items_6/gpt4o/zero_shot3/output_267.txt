Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  25  37  36   2  12
1  30  97  11  44  78  39
2  97  18  64  28  47  97
3  41  57  37  11  76  75
4  18  27  37  36  24  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total valuation across all agents. This approach is commonly referred to as the "maximum sum allocation" or "utilitarian allocation." Here's how we can proceed:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents to maximize their total valuation.
3. Ensure that all items are allocated, and each agent gets an integer number of items.

Let's calculate the allocation:

- Agent 0: Values items 0, 2, and 3 highly.
- Agent 1: Values item 1 highly.
- Agent 2: Values items 0 and 5 highly.
- Agent 3: Values item 4 and 5 highly.
- Agent 4: Values item 2 highly.

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 (73).
- Agent 1 gets item 1 (97).
- Agent 2 gets item 5 (97).
- Agent 3 gets item 4 (76).
- Agent 4 gets item 2 (37).
- Agent 0 gets item 3 (36) (since it still has a high value for Agent 0).

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to maximize the total valuation, and all items are distributed fairly. Here's the JSON representation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
