Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63  17  53  74  89  75
1  77   7  51  25   6  88
2  96  36  13  98  76  87
3  13  81  24  85  86  18
4  36  76  97  31  34  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items, while ensuring that every item is allocated. We also ensure that the allocation is fair, meaning that each agent should receive at least some value according to their preferences.

Here is one possible allocation that attempts to balance these considerations:

1. Agent 0: 
   - Items 3, 4 (Values: 74, 89)

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 5 (Value: 88)

3. Agent 2:
   - Items 0, 2 (Values: 96, 13)

4. Agent 3:
   - Item 1 (Value: 81)

5. Agent 4:
   - No items

This allocation gives each agent a portion of the items, trying to maximize their valuation where possible. Now, let's present this allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": []
}
```
