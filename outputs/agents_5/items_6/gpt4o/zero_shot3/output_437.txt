Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 22.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  44  15  72  86  73
1  90  58  22  19  94  53
2  90  90  48  77  80  99
3  16  61  83  26   4  18
4  49  92  73  77  28  57

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim to maximize the overall satisfaction. The goal is to distribute the six items such that each agent gets at least one item and the total valuations are as evenly distributed as possible.

Here's one approach to achieve this:

1. Start by assigning each agent the item they value the most, if possible.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item.
3. If more than one agent values an item equally, choose the agent who has the lowest overall allocation so far.

Let's go through the process step-by-step:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest at 95.
- Agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 94.
- Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 99.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 83.
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest at 92.

Next, we ensure each agent has at least one item and allocate the remaining item based on the highest valuation for the leftover items:

Items and agents based on highest remaining valuations:
- Agent 0: Item 0 (already allocated)
- Agent 1: Item 4 (already allocated)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (already allocated)
- Agent 3: Item 2 (already allocated)
- Agent 4: Item 1 (already allocated)

The remaining item is 3, which is valued highest by Agent 2 after their already allocated item.

The allocation is finalized as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5, 3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
