Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  40  82  58  37  32
1   5  21  30  51  21  92
2  75  35   3  70  23  58
3  38  46  43  75   8  46
4  10  64   6   5  72  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, one approach is to use a method that ensures each agent receives items that maximize their utility or value. We can start by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** High valuations for items 2 (82) and 3 (58).
2. **Agent 1:** High valuation for item 5 (92).
3. **Agent 2:** High valuation for item 0 (75).
4. **Agent 3:** High valuation for item 3 (75).
5. **Agent 4:** High valuation for item 4 (72).

Given these valuations, a fair allocation can be:

- Allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
- Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 2.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.
- Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

Now, we have one more item left, item 1, which we can allocate to the agent with the next highest valuation for it:

- Agent 4 has the next highest valuation for item 1 (64).

Thus, the final allocation would be:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [4, 1]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 1]
}
```
