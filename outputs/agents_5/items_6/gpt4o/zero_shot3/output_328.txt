Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  23  85  89  23  75
1  17  59  44  32  64  56
2  54  64  82  97  28  26
3  68  89  12  94  40  77
4  74  87  43  79  95  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by assigning items to agents based on their highest valuations. We need to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.

Here is one fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Assign item 3 (value 94) to agent 3, as it is their highest value, and also one of the highest among all agents.
2. Assign item 2 (value 85) to agent 0, as it is their highest value.
3. Assign item 1 (value 87) to agent 4, as it is their highest value.
4. Assign item 0 (value 54) to agent 2, as it is their highest value.
5. Assign item 4 (value 64) to agent 1, as it is their highest value.
6. Assign item 5 (value 75) to agent 0, as it is their next highest value after item 2.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
