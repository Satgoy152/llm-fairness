Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  68  51  87  92  11
1  54  55  15  87  45  73
2  34  56  14  81  17  70
3  63  15  58   1  78  77
4  98  72  92  68  91  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can adopt a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated. Given the valuations, one approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be approached:

1. For each item, determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure each item is allocated exactly once, and each agent is included in the final allocation, even if they end up with no items.

Let's determine the allocation:

- Item 0: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (98).
- Item 1: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (68).
- Item 2: Highest valuation is by Agent 4 (92).
- Item 3: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 and Agent 1 (87). We can assign it to Agent 0.
- Item 4: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (92).
- Item 5: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (77).

Allocating based on these valuations:

- Agent 0 gets items 1, 3, and 4.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets no items.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.
- Agent 4 gets items 0 and 2.

The allocation can be represented in JSON format as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3, 4],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent included in the allocation even if they receive no items.
