Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  69  43  25  24  21
1  15  23  24  53  51  83
2  90  93  93  57  43  98
3  40  15  18  75   0  79
4  96  35  50  10  64  35

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives. One approach is to allocate items based on the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is item 0 (90). Assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is item 5 (83). Assign item 5 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is item 2 (93). Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is item 3 (75). Assign item 3 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is item 0 (96), but it's already assigned. The next highest is item 4 (64). Assign item 4 to agent 4.

Now item 1 is left unassigned. We can allocate it to the agent with the highest remaining valuation for that item:

- **Agent 2** has the highest remaining valuation for item 1 (93). Assign item 1 to agent 2.

Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent gets items based on their highest valuations.
