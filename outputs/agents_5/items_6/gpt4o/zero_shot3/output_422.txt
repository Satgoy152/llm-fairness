Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  57  56  16  76  37
1  37   9  96  40  46  61
2  35  93   5  82   1  28
3  79  33   7  13  73  87
4   1  99  12  62  11  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 5 57 56 16 76 37]
 [37  9 96 40 46 61]
 [35 93  5 82  1 28]

 [ 1 99 12 62 11 10]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction or value for the agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. We also need to ensure that each item is allocated exactly once.

Let's analyze the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [5, 57, 56, 16, 76, 37]
Agent 1: [37, 9, 96, 40, 46, 61]
Agent 2: [35, 93, 5, 82, 1, 28]
Agent 3: [79, 33, 7, 13, 73, 87]
Agent 4: [1, 99, 12, 62, 11, 10]
```

To allocate the items, we can follow a strategy where each agent is allocated the item(s) they value most while ensuring no item is allocated more than once.

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value is 76 for item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is 96 for item 2.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value is 93 for item 1.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is 87 for item 5.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is 99 for item 1, but since item 1 is allocated to Agent 2, the next highest value is 62 for item 3.

Now, let's allocate these items based on the values:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 2.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 5.
- Agent 4 gets item 3.

The remaining item 0 needs to be allocated. Agent 3 has the highest unallocated value for item 0.

- Agent 3 additionally gets item 0.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5, 0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

In this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
