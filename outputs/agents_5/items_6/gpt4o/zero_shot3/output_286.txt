Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 97.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  20  13  93   1  97
1  30  59  97  54  89  72
2  82  44  42   9  67  38
3  47  69  49  86  39  46
4  99   7  77  82  23  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple approach where each agent tries to get the items with the highest value to them. This is a simplified approach that doesn't guarantee an optimal solution but provides a straightforward method to allocate items. Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives item 5 (value 97, highest for agent 0).
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 2 (value 97, highest for agent 1).
3. **Agent 2**: Receives item 0 (value 82, highest for agent 2).
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 3 (value 86, highest for agent 3).
5. **Agent 4**: Receives item 4 (value 23, highest for agent 4).
6. **Agent 0**: Receives item 1 (value 20, highest remaining value for agent 0).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item they value highly, and all items are distributed.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
