Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71   3  46  58  55   4
1  46  57  99  74  72  16
2  34   5  75  70  25   5
3  68  20  60  60  62  14
4  55  24  12  88   9  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 5 agents such that each agent gets an integer number of items, we need to determine a distribution that maximizes fairness based on the given valuations. One common method to achieve this is by using a "maximum sum allocation" or an "envy-free allocation" approach, trying to ensure that agents are as satisfied as possible with their allocations. However, given the constraints and the need for an integer allocation, a simple approach is to aim for a distribution that maximizes total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. Identify the highest value item for each agent and allocate it if it hasn't already been assigned.
2. Ensure all items are assigned by re-allocating items if necessary, while maintaining as much fairness as possible.

Following this process, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most, so assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most, so assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly, but it's already assigned, so assign the next highest, item 3, to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 the most, but it's already assigned, so assign item 4, the next highest, to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most, but it's already assigned, so assign item 5, the next highest, to agent 4.

This leaves item 1 unassigned. To allocate it, consider the remaining agents' preferences and balance the number of items each agent gets. Since agent 0 currently has only one item, assign item 1 to agent 0 to slightly balance the distribution.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This ensures each item is allocated, with a slight preference for agents with fewer items initially.
