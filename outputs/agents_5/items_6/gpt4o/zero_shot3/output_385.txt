Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  65  89  75  84  36
1  49  91  88  47  45  89
2  68  94  85  75  16  64
3  27  13  53  46  36  18
4   6  43  96  55  99  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize the total valuation for all agents while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm or optimization technique to achieve a fair distribution.

Let's allocate the items step-by-step:

1. **Agent 4** highly values item 4 (99), so let's allocate that item to Agent 4.
2. **Agent 1** highly values item 1 (91), so let's allocate that item to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 2 (85), and since item 2 hasn't been allocated yet, we can allocate it to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 0** values item 3 (75) highly, which hasn't been allocated yet, so we allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
5. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 0 (27) among unallocated items, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
6. **Agent 2** also has a relatively high valuation for item 5 (64), so we can allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

Now, let's structure the allocations. Each agent must be accounted for, even if they receive no items.

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, maximizing the total valuation based on the preferences.
