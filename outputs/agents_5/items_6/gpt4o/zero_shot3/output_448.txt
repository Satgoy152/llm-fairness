Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  51  70  53  74  85
1  71  98  63  13  52  55
2  26  27  22  83  24  86
3  70  87  14  12  76   2
4  35  81  37  99  80  58

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives or ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, depending on the goal. One common approach is to aim for an envy-free allocation, where each agent is as satisfied as possible compared to the others given the constraints.

Let's try to allocate the items based on maximizing the total value for each agent, keeping in mind that each agent should get at least one item if possible.

Here's a possible allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Gets item 5 (value 85)
- **Agent 1**: Gets item 1 (value 98)
- **Agent 2**: Gets item 3 (value 83)
- **Agent 3**: Gets item 0 (value 70)
- **Agent 4**: Gets items 2 (value 37) and 4 (value 80)

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and tries to maximize individual agent satisfaction.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
