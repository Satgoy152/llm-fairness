Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  36  44   1  70  26
1  91   5  32  54  42  77
2  61  13  41  70   6  67
3  28  66  29  86  59  64
4  73  72  94  63  26  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim for a distribution where at least each agent's total valuation is somewhat balanced or optimized based on their highest preferences. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. Identify each agent's highest valued items and try to assign those items to them.
2. Ensure that each item is assigned to only one agent and that all items are allocated.

Let's consider each agent's preferences:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (70).
- Agent 1 values item 0 the most (91).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (70).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (86), but Agent 2 has the same preference. We'll assign the next highest available for Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most (94).

Based on these preferences, let's attempt an allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 1.
3. Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
4. Assign item 1 to Agent 3 (second-highest value for Agent 3).
5. Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
6. Assign item 5 to Agent 3 (Agent 3's next highest preference).

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and each agent has a fair distribution based on their preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [2]
}
```
