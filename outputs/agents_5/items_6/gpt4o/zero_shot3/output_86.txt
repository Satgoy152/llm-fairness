Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  71  70   0  95  48
1  79  89  12  83  63   1
2   2  39  25  34  24  16
3  12  71  43  60  82  76
4  84  94  40  90  35  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: High value on item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: High value on items 1 and 3.
3. **Agent 2**: No particularly high values, but item 5 has a relative value.
4. **Agent 3**: High value on item 4, but it's already taken by Agent 0, so we look for the next best item.
5. **Agent 4**: High value on items 1 and 3, but they are already taken, so we look for the next best.

After considering the values and making sure no items are left unallocated, here's one fair allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 3
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 2

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
