Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  57  14  84  90  74
1   8  86  86  91  94  11
2  11  57  48  11  94   1
3  15  86  97  15  18   7
4  10  60  43  86  66  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their individual valuations. One way to approach this is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, provided that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

First, let's break down the allocations for each item:

1. **Item 0:** The highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 78.
2. **Item 1:** The highest valuation is by agents 1 and 3 with a value of 86 each. We'll give it to agent 1.
3. **Item 2:** The highest valuation is by agent 3 with a value of 97.
4. **Item 3:** The highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 91.
5. **Item 4:** The highest valuation is by agents 1 and 2 with a value of 94 each. We'll give it to agent 2.
6. **Item 5:** The highest valuation is by agent 0 with a value of 74.

Considering these choices, we ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible (some agents may end up with no items if their highest valuations are lower than others), and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.

Here's the json allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives items 1 and 3.
- Agent 2 receives item 4.
- Agent 3 receives item 2.
- Agent 4 does not receive any items. 

This distribution attempts to maximize the total values for each agent based on their preferences.
