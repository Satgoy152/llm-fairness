Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  34  82  55  89   5
1   3  82  76  11  98  92
2  24  18  76  21  20  49
3  16  36  50  35  94  25
4  86  22  82   9  13  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use a simple method that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Given the constraint that only and at least 6 items need to be allocated in total, the task is to ensure that every item is assigned to one of the agents.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 highly (90), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 highly (98), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 2 highly (76), so assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 highly (94), but since item 4 is already taken, assign item 5 to agent 3, which is their next highest value (25).
5. Agent 4 values item 0 highly (86), but since item 0 is already taken, assign item 2 to agent 4, which is their next highest value (82), but since item 2 is also taken, assign item 5 to agent 4, which is their next highest value (59).

Now, every agent must have an item, and there should be no duplicates in item allocation. Adjusting the allocation to ensure no item is assigned more than once:

- Agent 0: items [0]
- Agent 1: items [4]
- Agent 2: items [2]
- Agent 3: items [5]
- Agent 4: items [1, 3]

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent has at least one item, and no item is assigned more than once.

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```
