Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  95  96   7  33  35
1  87  47  93  88  52  70
2   8  53  36  70  18  80
3  29  55  74  80  24  24
4   7  44  10  43  65   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that seeks to maximize the total valuation for each agent. A common method for this kind of allocation is to use a greedy algorithm or the maximum weighted matching in a bipartite graph. 

Given the table of valuations, let's allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (96)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 0

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (87)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 1

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (80)
   - Allocate Item 5 to Agent 2

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (80)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 3

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (65)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 4

Now, we have allocated 5 items. The remaining item is Item 1, which should be allocated to the agent with the next highest valuation that has not yet received their top choice.

- **Agent 0** has the highest remaining valuation for Item 1 (95), and since each agent should receive an integer number of items, we can allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on maximizing the valuations from the table.
