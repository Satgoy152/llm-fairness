Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  59  17  31  48  97
1   0  33  47  27  92  43
2  98  43  29  82  96  83
3  72  75  17  75  27  29
4  67  19   2  99   6   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
In order to fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated. We can use a method to maximize the total value each agent gets based on their preferences. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign Agent 0 the item for which they have the highest value.
2. Repeat the process for the other agents, taking into account the items that have already been allocated.

Considering the table and trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction:

- Agent 0 has the highest value for item 5.
- Agent 1 has the highest value for item 4.
- Agent 2 has the highest value for item 0.
- Agent 3 has the highest value for items 1 and 3 (both are equal), but item 1 is free first.
- Agent 4 has the highest value for item 3, but item 3 is already taken, so we check the next highest available.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- Assign item 5 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 4.
- The only item left, item 2, can be assigned to Agent 0 as a secondary consideration.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent gets at least one item based on their highest preferences available.
