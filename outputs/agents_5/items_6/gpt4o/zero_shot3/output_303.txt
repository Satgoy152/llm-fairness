Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  88  23  71  37  18
1  10  93  56  35  31  53
2  65  60  89  60  33  14
3  57  94  21   0   4  76
4   0   6  36  24  57  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is balanced. Here's a possible allocation considering the valuations:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued items to agents who value them the most.
2. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible, balancing the number of items and the total value.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most (88). Assign item 1 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (93), but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 2 (56). Assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (89), but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 0 (65). Assign item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (94), but it's already assigned. Next highest is item 5 (76). Assign item 5 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (57). Assign item 4 to agent 4.

Now, we have assigned 5 items. We need to assign one more item:

- Item 3 is left unassigned. The highest valuation for item 3 is by agent 0 (71), but agent 0 already has an item. Consider balancing the assignments:
  - Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value 24), as it balances out the distribution across agents.

After this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 3]
}
```
