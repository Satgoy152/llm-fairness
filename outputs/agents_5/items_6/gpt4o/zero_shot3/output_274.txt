Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64   3  24  66  54  14
1  53  87  65  94  56  27
2   9  46  60  73  54  12
3  30  55  30  21  45   6
4  18  15  38  24  38  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation of the items each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Additionally, we need to ensure that exactly 6 items are allocated in total.

Let's start by assigning items based on the highest individual valuations for each agent and ensure no agent is left without an item:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest valued item: 3 (value 66)

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest valued item: 3 (value 94)
   - Since item 3 is already assigned to Agent 0, choose next highest valued item: 1 (value 87)

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest valued item: 3 (value 73)
   - Since item 3 is already assigned, choose next highest valued item: 2 (value 60)

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest valued item: 1 (value 55)
   - Since item 1 is already assigned, choose next highest valued item: 4 (value 45)

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest valued item: 5 (value 64)

With this initial allocation, we have assigned items 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Item 0 remains unallocated. Let's assign item 0 based on remaining needs:

- **Agent 4** has only one item, so they will receive item 0 (value 18).

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [3]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [5, 0]

Here's the JSON format of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and all 6 items are allocated.
