Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 88.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  73  82  76  33  74
1  28  26  88   8  17  91
2  66  32  67  25  10  62
3  63  94   1  34  94  59
4  74  76   7   0  29  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Let's try to allocate items to maximize each agent's total value.

Let's start by examining the highest values attributed by each agent and allocate the items accordingly while ensuring that each item is given only once.

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest values for items 2 and 5.
   - Consider allocating items 2 and 5 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest values for items 5 and 2.
   - Since item 5 is already allocated, allocate item 1 to Agent 1 as it's the next highest value.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest values for items 0 and 2.
   - Since item 2 is already allocated, allocate item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest values for items 1 and 4.
   - Since item 1 is already allocated, allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest values for items 0 and 1.
   - Since items 0 and 1 are already allocated, allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Following this allocation, each agent gets items that they value highly while ensuring all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
