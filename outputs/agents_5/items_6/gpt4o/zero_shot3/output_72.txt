Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  15  42   4  80  55
1  89  35  85  97  30   8
2  61  74  66  47  83  72
3  82  98  87  85  99  25
4  25  33  22  55  71  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. This involves analyzing the valuations and distributing the items in a way that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: Start by identifying the highest value each agent assigns to any item. This helps in ensuring that each agent gets at least one item they highly value.

2. **Assign items iteratively**: Allocate items to agents based on the highest remaining valuation, ensuring that each agent gets a fair share and that all items are allocated.

3. **Ensure fairness**: Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure each agent receives a fair share of the total valuation.

Let's start the allocation process:

1. **Agent 3** has high valuations across the board, especially for items 1 (98) and 4 (99). Assign item 4 to agent 3.

2. **Agent 1** values item 3 highly (97). Assign item 3 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 0** values item 4 highly (80), but since it's already assigned, the next highest is item 0 (48). Assign item 0 to agent 0.

4. **Agent 2** values item 5 highly (72). Assign item 5 to agent 2.

5. **Agent 4** can receive item 1 (33) after other top preferences are considered. Assign item 1 to agent 4.

6. **Remaining item (2)** needs to be assigned fairly. Agent 1 has the highest remaining valuation (85) for item 2. Assign item 2 to agent 1.

The allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
