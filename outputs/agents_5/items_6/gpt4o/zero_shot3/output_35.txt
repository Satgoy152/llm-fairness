Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  98  79  16  33  62
1  23  75  87  46  16  76
2  51  51  38  15  22  72
3  32  28  33  51  57  32
4  29  84  11  14   2  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can aim to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. Let's analyze the valuations and try to assign items in a way that each agent gets a fair share considering their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for item 1 and item 5.
2. **Agent 1**: Has high valuations for item 2 and item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a relatively high valuation for item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Doesn't have high valuations, but item 4 is the highest for them.
5. **Agent 4**: Has a high valuation for item 1.

Let's allocate items based on these observations:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (value 98) is the highest overall valuation.
- **Agent 1**: Item 2 (value 87) is one of the highest.
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (value 72) is their highest.
- **Agent 3**: Item 4 (value 57) is their highest.
- **Agent 4**: Item 0 (value 29) is a balance for them.
- **Agent 0**: Item 3 (value 16) can be reassigned to balance the allocation.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the items based on the highest valuations for each agent while ensuring fairness in distribution.
