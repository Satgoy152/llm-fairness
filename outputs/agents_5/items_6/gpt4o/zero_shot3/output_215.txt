Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  34  96  89  16  16
1  39  51   5  75   1  58
2  91  54  80  62  10  22
3  48  29  51  30  84  23
4   2  13  49  22  81  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider maximizing the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive 2 items and the rest will receive 1 item each.

Here is the allocation based on maximizing the agents' valuations:

1. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 0 (91) and should receive it.
2. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (96) and should receive it.
3. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 4 (84) and should receive it.
4. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (51) and should receive it.
5. Agent 1 also has a high valuation for item 3 (75) compared to other agents, so they should receive it.
6. Agent 4 has the highest remaining valuation for item 5 (23) and should receive it.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```
