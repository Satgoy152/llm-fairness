Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  32   1  77  97  26
1   2  13  30  51  17  14
2  71  10  73  26  50  22
3  74  12  17  90  67  42
4  63   1  60  21  46  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [ 2 13 30 51 17 14]
 [71 10 73 26 50 22]

 [63  1 60 21 46 55]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's one way to approach the problem:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent can receive for each item.
2. Allocate the items to the agents in such a way that maximizes the total valuation for each agent.

Using this approach, we can follow these steps to allocate the items:

- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 4 (value 97).
- Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 90).
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 2 (value 73).
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 0 (value 67).
- Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 5 (value 55).
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 1 (value 13).

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent and the total valuation is maximized across all agents. 

Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
