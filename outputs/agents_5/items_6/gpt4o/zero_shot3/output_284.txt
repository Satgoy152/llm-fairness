Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  62  88  90  87   6
1  18  89  19  30  43  42
2  48  76  75  28  43  59
3  72  20  17  38  28  49
4  78   6  89  79  50  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's one possible approach:

1. Begin by identifying each agent's highest-valued items.
2. Allocate items such that each agent receives at least one of their highest-valued items while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a potential allocation based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values items 3 (90) and 2 (88) highly.
- Agent 1 values item 1 (89) highly.
- Agent 2 values item 0 (48) highly.
- Agent 3 values item 0 (72) highly.
- Agent 4 values item 2 (89) highly.

Considering these preferences, here's a proposed allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3 and 5
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 2

This ensures that each agent receives items of high value to them while distributing all items. Below is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
