Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  42  78   8  55  21
1  36  46  76  82  70  31
2  63  23  12  94  54  81
3  61  51  56  57  58  73
4  31  61  94  25  83  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [31 61 94 25 83 86]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated and each agent receives at least one item. This is a kind of fair division problem where we try to assign items based on the preferences (or valuations) of the agents.

Given the matrix of values:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  42  78   8  55  21
1  36  46  76  82  70  31
2  63  23  12  94  54  81
3  61  51  56  57  58  73
4  31  61  94  25  83  86
```

We'll assign items based on the highest valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Below is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 2 (value 78)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (value 82)
- Agent 2: Item 5 (value 81)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (value 61)
- Agent 4: Items 1 and 4 (values 61 and 83)

This allocation ensures that each agent has at least one item and the items are fairly distributed according to the highest valuations.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
