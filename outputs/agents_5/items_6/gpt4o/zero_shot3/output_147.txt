Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  95  56  50  29  10
1  59  86   4  22  23  10
2  80  96  82  59  47  16
3   0  42  39  72  83   4
4  99  86  13  92  53  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we consider the valuations each agent has for each item. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive two items, and the others will receive one item each.

Here is a potential fair allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 1 the most. Assign item 1 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the most. Assign item 0 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 1 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest value for agent 2 is item 2. Assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the most. Assign item 4 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 0 the most, but it's already taken. The next highest value for agent 4 is item 3. Assign item 3 to agent 4.
6. We still have item 5 unallocated. Check which agent can get additional value from this item:
   - Agent 0: 10
   - Agent 1: 10
   - Agent 2: 16
   - Agent 3: 4
   - Agent 4: 14
   
   Assign item 5 to agent 2, as they get the highest value from it.

Thus, the allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
