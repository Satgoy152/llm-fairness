Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 87.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  63  17   3  39   4
1  80  36  87   3  33  33
2  23  51  86  13  18  38
3  93  17  89  90  98  11
4  89  88  13  66  63  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that considers each agent's valuations and seeks to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The aim is to ensure a fair distribution based on the provided valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: [25, 63, 17,  3, 39,  4]
Agent 1: [80, 36, 87,  3, 33, 33]
Agent 2: [23, 51, 86, 13, 18, 38]
Agent 3: [93, 17, 89, 90, 98, 11]
Agent 4: [89, 88, 13, 66, 63, 86]
```

We can assign items to agents based on their highest valuations while ensuring that each item is allocated to only one agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 3 highly values item 4 (value 98), so allocate item 4 to agent 3.
2. Agent 1 highly values item 2 (value 87), so allocate item 2 to agent 1.
3. Agent 4 highly values item 1 (value 88), so allocate item 1 to agent 4.
4. Agent 2 highly values item 5 (value 38), so allocate item 5 to agent 2.
5. Agent 0 highly values item 0 (value 25), so allocate item 0 to agent 0.
6. The remaining item 3 has a reasonable valuation for agent 3 (value 90), so allocate item 3 to agent 3.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item and capitalizes on their high valuations. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
