Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 18.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  36  10  45  45  11   3
1   7  45  18  62  49  94
2  69  63  14  26  23  61
3  98  18  59  83   3   2
4  46  91  15  47  38  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Given the valuations, we aim to distribute the items in a way that is as balanced as possible in terms of value.

Here's one approach to allocate the items:

1. Start by assigning the highest valued item to each agent.
2. Distribute the remaining items in a way that balances the total value for each agent.

Following this approach, here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Balance the remaining item (Item 2) to ensure all agents have at least one item and to balance the total value.

Final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent has at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.
