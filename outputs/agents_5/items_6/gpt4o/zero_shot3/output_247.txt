Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  23  99  73  39  54
1  90  47  74   1  20  31
2  49   5  91  48  84  61
3  43   2  83   8  85  11
4  14  89  68  68   2  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or value that each agent receives from their allocated items, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's use a greedy approach to assign items based on the highest valuation until all items are allocated. Here is how the allocation process can look like, step-by-step:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 1 values it the highest at 90.
   - Allocate item 0 to agent 1.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 4 values it the highest at 89.
   - Allocate item 1 to agent 4.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 99.
   - Allocate item 2 to agent 0.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 0 values it the highest at 73.
   - Allocate item 3 to agent 0.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 3 values it the highest at 85.
   - Allocate item 4 to agent 3.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 4 values it the highest at 97.
   - Allocate item 5 to agent 4.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned to agents and each agent receives an integer number of items.
