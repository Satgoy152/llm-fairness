Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42   4   2   4  27  22
1   6  41  68  26  81  62
2  37  43  12   8  39  32
3  30  68  85  35  58  70
4  44  64  82  20  75  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, at least one agent will receive more than one item.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy:

1. First, we examine the highest valuations for each item across all agents.
2. We then allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations while attempting to distribute the items as evenly as possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- **Item 0** has the highest valuation of 44 from Agent 4.
- **Item 1** has the highest valuation of 68 from Agent 3.
- **Item 2** has the highest valuation of 85 from Agent 3.
- **Item 3** has the highest valuation of 35 from Agent 3 (since Agent 3 has already two items, we can consider other agents for a fair distribution).
- **Item 4** has the highest valuation of 81 from Agent 1.
- **Item 5** has the highest valuation of 70 from Agent 3 (again, Agent 3 has already two items, so we consider other agents).

Now, distribute items to ensure fairness:

- **Agent 0**: No items as no highest valuations.
- **Agent 1**: Item 4
- **Agent 2**: Item 5 (next highest valuation among remaining options)
- **Agent 3**: Items 1 and 2
- **Agent 4**: Items 0 and 3 (based on remaining choices and fair distribution)

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```

This allocation considers the highest individual item valuations while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items, maintaining fairness across the agents given the constraints.
