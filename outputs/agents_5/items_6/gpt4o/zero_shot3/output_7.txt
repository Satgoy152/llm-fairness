Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  86  73  82  82  13
1   2  17   3  38  59  38
2  71  98  73  16  14  70
3  42   7  68  95  65  74
4  93  93  37  50   5  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [93 93 37 50  5 45]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will use a method that ensures each agent gets at least one item and tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent. In this scenario, we have 5 agents and 6 items. Thus, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one item each. 

Let's review the valuations and make the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuations for item 1 (86) and item 3 (82).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation for item 4 (59).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation for item 1 (98).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation for item 3 (95).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation for item 0 (93) and item 1 (93).

To ensure fairness, let's allocate based on these valuations:

- Agent 0 will receive item 1 (86).
- Agent 1 will receive item 4 (59).
- Agent 2 will receive item 5 (70).
- Agent 3 will receive item 3 (95).
- Agent 4 will receive item 0 (93).

Now, we have 5 items allocated, and one item remains unallocated. Let's allocate the remaining item 2, which has moderate valuations across the agents:

- Agent 0 has a valuation of 73 for item 2.
- Agent 2 also has a valuation of 73 for item 2.

To balance allocations, let's give item 2 to Agent 0, who will get two items.

Hereâ€™s the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, with Agent 0 receiving two items.
