Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  87  86  38  53   6
1  81  15  34  68  36  70
2  43  50  34  37   0  11
3  29  14  60  51  90  62
4  51  30  31  36  61  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[14 87 86 38 53  6]
 [81 15 34 68 36 70]
 [43 50 34 37  0 11]
 [29 14 60 51 90 62]
 [51 30 31 36 61 97]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on their given valuations. Hereâ€™s one possible allocation:

- Assign items based on the highest value an agent places on them, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible, and that all items are allocated.

Here is a possible allocation for the given table:

1. Agent 0 should receive item 1 (value 87).
2. Agent 1 should receive items 3 and 5 (values 68 and 70).
3. Agent 2 should receive item 0 (value 43).
4. Agent 3 should receive item 4 (value 90).
5. Agent 4 should receive item 2 (value 31).

Based on the above logic, here is the JSON format for the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents while aiming to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations.
