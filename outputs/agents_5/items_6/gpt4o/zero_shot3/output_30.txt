Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  61  66  78  80  60
1  22  46   1  33  51  58
2  85  48  62  87  90  12
3   7  55  29  79  55  94
4  67  85  69   0  37  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is assigned to an agent. One approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most.

Here is the process for allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation for item 0 is from agent 2 with a value of 85.
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation for item 1 is from agent 4 with a value of 85.
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation for item 2 is from agent 0 with a value of 66.
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation for item 3 is from agent 2 with a value of 87.
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation for item 4 is from agent 2 with a value of 90.
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation for item 5 is from agent 3 with a value of 94.

With this allocation method, we ensure each item is assigned to an agent who values it highly. Here's the allocation presented in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 3, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 6 items are fairly distributed based on the highest valuations per item.
