Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  73  84  40  80  55  77
1  75  99  37  16  74  46
2  47  95  75  82  42  55
3  82  56  35  83  61  96
4  78   9  72  35  19  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[73 84 40 80 55 77]
 [75 99 37 16 74 46]
 [47 95 75 82 42 55]

 [78  9 72 35 19 99]]
Output:
To allocate the 6 items among the 5 agents fairly, we need to ensure each agent receives an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated. Given the valuations table, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.

Let's look for a fair allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 0 highly at 73 and item 3 at 80.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 1 highly at 99.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 3 highly at 82.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 5 highly at 96.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 5 highly at 99.

To ensure fairness, we can allocate items based on maximizing the valuations for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Assign item 3 to Agent 0 because Agent 0 values it highly and it prevents conflict with Agent 2 over item 3.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1 since they value it the most.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 2 as they value it decently, and it doesn't conflict with high-value items for others.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 3 since they have a decent valuation for it.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4 because they value it the most among others.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0 as a compromise since they also have a decent valuation for it.

This allocation considers maximizing the overall satisfaction of agents while distributing items fairly. The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This ensures all items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
