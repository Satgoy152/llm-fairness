Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  23  93  32  95  13
1  26  70  51  37  84  82
2  38  26  34  66  76  16
3  18  62  50  52  26  82
4  47   7  99   9  63   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We will attempt to distribute the items such that each agent gets at least one item, and the overall distribution is fair based on their preferences.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 (95) and item 2 (93) highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 4 (84) and item 5 (82) highly.
3. Agent 2 values item 4 (76) highly.
4. Agent 3 values item 5 (82) and item 3 (52) highly.
5. Agent 4 values item 2 (99) highly.

Based on these observations, we can allocate the items as follows:
- Assign item 4 to Agent 0, as they value it the highest (95).
- Assign item 5 to Agent 1, as they value it the second highest (82) after Agent 3, but Agent 3 can be given another high-value item.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 4, as they value it the highest (99).
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as they value it the second highest after item 5.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it has a moderate value for them, and it helps in achieving fairness.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as it is a significant value for them and balances the allocation.

Let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed based on the agents' preferences as fairly as possible.
