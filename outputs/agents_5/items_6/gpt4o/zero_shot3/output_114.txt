Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  30  12  53  14  65
1  84  94  21  39  61  62
2   5   5  53  77  35  88
3  71  11   4  45  13  56
4  17  66  77  10  44  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [17 66 77 10 44 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Given the constraints, here is one possible allocation:

1. Analyze the valuations and consider allocating items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible.
2. Ensure that no more than 6 items are allocated in total.

Based on the given valuations, a possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (valuation 65)
- Agent 1: Item 1 (valuation 94)
- Agent 2: Item 3 (valuation 77)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (valuation 71)
- Agent 4: Item 2 (valuation 77)
- Remaining item 4 can be allocated to the agent who has the next highest valuation for an unallocated item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all six items are allocated in total.
