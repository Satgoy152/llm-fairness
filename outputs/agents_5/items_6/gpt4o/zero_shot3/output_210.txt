Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  98   4  99  54   3
1  86  49  67  45  45  75
2  46  21  18  40  23  75
3  20  44  90  46   7  24
4  55  60  81  15  54  88

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuation of the items. Here's one way to allocate the items, considering each agent receives at least one item, and their preferences are respected as much as possible:

- Agent 0 values items 0, 1, and 3 highly.
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest.
- Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the highest among the agents, but since that's already allocated, we look for the next available highest.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly, but since that's taken, we look for the next highest available item.

Based on the above observations, here's a possible allocation:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
4. Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
5. Allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
6. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
