Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  63  37  66   1  30
1  77  66  59  63  56  50
2  86  13  48  68   6   2
3  29  92  80  91  76  46
4  71  59  28  21  73   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy approach. The goal is to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Here is one possible allocation method:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If multiple agents value an item equally, assign it to the agent with fewer items, or randomly if they have the same number.

Let's perform the allocation:

- **Item 0**: Agent 2 values it the most with 86.
- **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most with 92.
- **Item 2**: Agent 3 values it the most with 80.
- **Item 3**: Agent 0 values it the most with 66 (Agent 0 and Agent 3 both value it equally, but Agent 0 has fewer items initially).
- **Item 4**: Agent 4 values it the most with 73.
- **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most with 50.

Now let's ensure each agent receives at least one item. In this allocation, each agent already receives at least one item, so no further adjustments are necessary.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
