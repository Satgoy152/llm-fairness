Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  25  89  22  45  41
1  45  61  72  75  61  29
2  62  57  77  75  85  78
3  27  34  67  37  83  72
4  28  68  16  49  11  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a greedy algorithm where each item is allocated to the agent that values it the most. This ensures that each item is given to the agent who has the highest relative valuation for it. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 84.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values item 1 the most at 68.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the most at 89.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 and Agent 2 both value item 3 at 75. We can assign it to Agent 1 to balance allocations.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values item 4 the most at 85.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values item 5 the most at 78.

Now let's check the allocations:

- Agent 0 has items 0 and 2.
- Agent 1 has item 3.
- Agent 2 has items 4 and 5.
- Agent 3 has no items.
- Agent 4 has item 1.

This allocation respects the condition that each agent can get an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1]
}
```
