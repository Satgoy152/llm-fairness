Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20  74  40   5   3  59
1  11  16  99  62  69  98
2  93  48  58  34  93  32
3  24  79  74  63  69  52
4  75  60  52   9  63  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations while ensuring that every agent receives an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated.

Here's the step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Valuations: [20, 74, 40, 5, 3, 59]
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (74) and Item 5 (59)
   - Allocate Item 1 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Valuations: [11, 16, 99, 62, 69, 98]
   - Highest valuations: Item 2 (99) and Item 5 (98)
   - Allocate Item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Valuations: [93, 48, 58, 34, 93, 32]
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (93) and Item 4 (93)
   - Allocate Item 0 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Valuations: [24, 79, 74, 63, 69, 52]
   - Highest valuations: Item 1 (79) and Item 4 (69)
   - Allocate Item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Valuations: [75, 60, 52, 9, 63, 49]
   - Highest valuations: Item 0 (75) and Item 1 (60)
   - Allocate Item 3 to Agent 4.

We have now allocated items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. The remaining item is:

- Item 5, which hasn't been allocated yet.

Checking the remaining agents:
- Agent 0 values Item 5 at 59, which is the highest among unallocated items.
- Agent 1 values Item 5 at 98, which is the highest remaining value for any agent.
- Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1.

Final allocations:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and all 6 items are allocated.
