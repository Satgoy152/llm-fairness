Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  48  87  40  82  17
1  73  58  95  40  78  75
2  29  43  27   4  99  52
3  95  22  55  85  85  39
4  17  88  64  35   5  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider each agent's preferences and aim for a distribution that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. The goal is to distribute all 6 items among the 5 agents.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most at 95. Assign item 0 to agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 4 values it the most at 88. Assign item 1 to agent 4.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 1 values it the most at 95. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values it the most at 85. Since agent 3 already has item 0, we can consider the next highest valuation. Agent 0 values it at 40, assign item 3 to agent 0.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 2 values it the most at 99. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it at 75, which is the highest remaining valuation. Assign item 5 to agent 1.

Now, we ensure each agent gets at least one item. Agent 1 already has item 2 and 5. Agent 3 has item 0. Agent 4 has item 1. Agent 2 has item 4. Agent 0 has item 3. All agents have at least one item.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, each agent receives at least one item, and preferences are maximized as much as possible given the constraints.
