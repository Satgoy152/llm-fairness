Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  61  42  64  21  98
1  21   8  84  24  10   3
2  45  46  18  73  14  75
3  11  32  70  24  52  90
4   9  73  35  43  84  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[81 61 42 64 21 98]
 [21  8 84 24 10  3]
 [45 46 18 73 14 75]
 [11 32 70 24 52 90]
 [ 9 73 35 43 84 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations given by each agent for the items and attempt to maximize the total satisfaction for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Step 1: Analyze the valuations matrix from the table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  61  42  64  21  98
1  21   8  84  24  10   3
2  45  46  18  73  14  75
3  11  32  70  24  52  90
4   9  73  35  43  84  47
```

Step 2: Aim to allocate items such that each agent gets an item they highly value, while also ensuring all items are distributed.

Step 3: Choose allocations:
- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 5.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly.
- Agent 3 values item 5 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly.

Let's make the allocations based on these observations to maximize overall satisfaction and ensure every agent gets at least one item. 

Step 4: Allocate:
- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Allocate remaining item 1 to Agent 0 as it is their second-highest valued item.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving at least one item, and maximizes the valuations based on the given matrix.
