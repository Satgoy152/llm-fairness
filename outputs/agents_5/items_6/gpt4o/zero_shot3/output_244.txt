Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  79  59  71  15  85
1  23   3  11  28   5  67
2  31  98  43   6  99  91
3  91  26  82  70  21  41
4  23  38  56   7  18  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, at least one agent will get more than one item. We'll try to distribute the items such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for agent 0 is for item 0. Assign item 0 to agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for agent 1 is for item 5. Assign item 5 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for agent 2 is for item 4. Assign item 4 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for agent 3 is for item 0, but item 0 is already taken. The next highest value is for item 2. Assign item 2 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for agent 4 is for item 5, but item 5 is already taken. The next highest number is for item 2, which is also taken. The next highest is for item 1. Assign item 1 to agent 4.

Now, we have one item left: item 3. We need to assign it to one of the agents without any items or with the minimum total value. We will assign item 3 to agent 0 to balance the values.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents.
