Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  68  82  74  70   1
1  37  89  71  14  65  30
2  48  40  58  59  42  10
3  42  19  50  88  23  45
4  15  30  20  66  31  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each item by each agent and try to distribute the items so that each agent's allocation maximizes their perceived value, while also ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Values: [88, 68, 82, 74, 70, 1]
   - Best items: 0, 2

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Values: [37, 89, 71, 14, 65, 30]
   - Best items: 1

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Values: [48, 40, 58, 59, 42, 10]
   - Best items: 3

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Values: [42, 19, 50, 88, 23, 45]
   - Best items: 4

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Values: [15, 30, 20, 66, 31, 52]
   - Best items: 5

By allocating the items based on maximizing each agent's utility for the items they value most highly, we can achieve a fair distribution. Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents while maximizing each agent's received value based on their preferences.
