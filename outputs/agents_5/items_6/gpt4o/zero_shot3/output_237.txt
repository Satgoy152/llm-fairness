Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  24  88  12  32  91
1  47  66  99  59  81  77
2  79  39  43  83   0  59
3  98  36  99   3  14  78
4  58  67  72  98  42  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction or valuation sum while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. The goal is to distribute the 6 items in a way that reflects the preferences of the agents as closely as possible.

Let's analyze the valuation table for a potential allocation:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 7      | 24     | 88     | 12     | 32     | 91     |
| 1     | 47     | 66     | 99     | 59     | 81     | 77     |
| 2     | 79     | 39     | 43     | 83     | 0      | 59     |
| 3     | 98     | 36     | 99     | 3      | 14     | 78     |
| 4     | 58     | 67     | 72     | 98     | 42     | 84     |

One possible way to allocate the items is as follows:

1. Assign Item 5 to Agent 0 (value: 91).
2. Assign Item 2 to Agent 1 (value: 99).
3. Assign Item 3 to Agent 2 (value: 83).
4. Assign Item 0 to Agent 3 (value: 98).
5. Assign Item 1 to Agent 4 (value: 67).
6. Assign Item 4 to Agent 4 (value: 42).

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, with each agent receiving at least one item.
