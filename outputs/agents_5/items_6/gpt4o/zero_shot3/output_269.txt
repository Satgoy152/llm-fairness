Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  47   9  62  66  19
1  96   6  94  50  26  59
2  90  20  77  15  28  31
3  83  32  74  66  80  55
4  59  25  78  14  72   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total utility for each agent while ensuring all items are allocated. Here's how we can approach the problem:

1. **Identify Optimal Allocations:** We will consider each agent's valuations for the items and attempt to allocate items to maximize the total valuation for all agents.

2. **Ensure Fair Distribution:** Each agent should get at least one item if possible, and the total number of items allocated should equal the total number of items available (6 in this case).

Let's proceed with allocating the items:

1. **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are for items 0, 4.
2. **Agent 1:** Highest valuation is for item 0, but second highest is item 2.
3. **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is for item 0, but that is already preferred by Agent 0. Next highest are items 2, 5.
4. **Agent 3:** Highest valuations are for items 4, 0, 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Highest valuation is for item 2, but second highest is item 0, 4.

Given these, a reasonable allocation might look like this:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
- Reallocate item 1 to Agent 0, as it's the next highest valued unallocated item for them.

Now, let's present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving items based on their highest valuations where feasible.
