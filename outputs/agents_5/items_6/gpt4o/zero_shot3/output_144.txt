Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 1.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  92  71  22   5  76
1  49  93   1  27  58  55
2  13  91  53  19  12  89
3  49  54  90  41  28   2
4  40   0  36  92  65  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One common approach is to use a method that assigns items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. However, with only 6 items and 5 agents, one agent will end up with two items.

Here's one way to allocate the items based on maximizing valuations:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 1 (value 93 - highest for item 1).
2. Assign item 0 to agent 0 (value 81 - highest for item 0).
3. Assign item 2 to agent 3 (value 90 - highest for item 2).
4. Assign item 3 to agent 4 (value 92 - highest for item 3).
5. Assign item 5 to agent 2 (value 89 - highest for item 5).
6. Assign item 4 to agent 1 (value 58 - highest remaining for item 4).

Now, all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item. Here's how the allocations look:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```
