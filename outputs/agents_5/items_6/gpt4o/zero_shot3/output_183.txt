Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  85  67  28  55  16
1  22  36  38  52   0  95
2  33  24   5  26  18   3
3  48  22   8   7  39  15
4  47  47  81  20  54  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider each agent's valuations and try to balance the overall satisfaction. We have 5 agents and 6 items. Our goal is to distribute the items in a way that maximizes fairness. 

Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent has high valuations for items 0 and 1. Allocating these items to agent 0 would maximize their satisfaction.
   
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 5 the highest. Allocating item 5 to agent 1 would be a good choice.

3. **Agent 2**: This agent doesn't have very high valuations compared to other agents. Assigning item 2 would be reasonable since it's relatively low-valued for others too.

4. **Agent 3**: This agent doesn't have high valuations, similar to agent 2. Item 3 could be allocated to agent 3 as it has a relatively lower valuation for other agents.

5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 4 quite high compared to others. Allocating item 4 to agent 4 would be fair.

Considering these observations, here is a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 1.
- Agent 1 gets item 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets item 3.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
