Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  23  85  15  25  26
1  89  42  95  30  62  12
2  24  43  88  59  80  63
3   7   2  24  49  43  61
4  94  61  83  64  32  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Here's how we can approach this:

1. Each agent should get at least one item.
2. Try to assign items such that the total value each agent receives is maximized.
3. Ensure that all 6 items are allocated.

Let's go through the allocation process:

- Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 0. Assign item 0 to agent 4.
- Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 4. Assign item 4 to agent 2.
- Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 3. Assign item 3 to agent 0.
- Agent 3 has a relatively higher valuation for item 5 than the other items. Assign item 5 to agent 3.
- For item 1, agent 4 also has a higher valuation than the others. Assign item 1 to agent 4.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
