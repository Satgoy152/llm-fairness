Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  11  16  46  29  74
1  81  72   5  90  60  17
2   1  32   3  57  32  22
3   2  18  99  88  29  57
4  13  15  24  13  85   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. A reasonable approach is to allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Valuation of items: [78, 11, 16, 46, 29, 74]
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (78)

2. **Agent 1**: Valuation of items: [81, 72, 5, 90, 60, 17]
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (90)

3. **Agent 2**: Valuation of items: [1, 32, 3, 57, 32, 22]
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (57), but already taken.
   - Next highest: Item 1 (32)

4. **Agent 3**: Valuation of items: [2, 18, 99, 88, 29, 57]
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (99)

5. **Agent 4**: Valuation of items: [13, 15, 24, 13, 85, 9]
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (85)

Now, let's allocate the remaining item fairly. Item 5 is left:

- Agent 0 has a high valuation (74) for item 5, which is the highest among the remaining allocations.

Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
