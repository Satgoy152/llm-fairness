Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  34  13  84  56  82
1  35  67  26  11  33  36
2  83  98  47  68  61  84
3  53  60  83  10  84   3
4  41  66  67  11  47  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 6 items are distributed. We'll aim for a fair allocation by considering the agents' valuations of the items and trying to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 0 to the agent who values it the most:
   - Agent 2 values item 0 at 83.

2. Assign item 1 to the agent who values it the most:
   - Agent 2 values item 1 at 98. 

3. Assign item 2 to the agent who values it the most:
   - Agent 3 values item 2 at 83.

4. Assign item 3 to the agent who values it the most:
   - Agent 0 values item 3 at 84.

5. Assign item 4 to the agent who values it the most:
   - Agent 3 values item 4 at 84.

6. Assign item 5 to the agent who values it the most:
   - Agent 4 values item 5 at 87.

Based on this strategy, each agent receives the following items:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and attempts to maximize the total valuation by assigning items to the agents who value them the most.
