Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  51  35  65  80  63
1  80  41  52  36  11  71
2  90  13  59  56  74  35
3  81   3  92  28  50  38
4  85  87  31   4  12  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets a fair share. Here, a simple approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Let's consider each item and allocate it to the agent with the highest valuation for that item:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 72
   - Agent 1 values it at 80
   - Agent 2 values it at 90 (highest)
   - Agent 3 values it at 81
   - Agent 4 values it at 85
   - **Allocate to Agent 2**

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 51
   - Agent 1 values it at 41
   - Agent 2 values it at 13
   - Agent 3 values it at 3
   - Agent 4 values it at 87 (highest)
   - **Allocate to Agent 4**

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 35
   - Agent 1 values it at 52
   - Agent 2 values it at 59 (highest)
   - Agent 3 values it at 92
   - Agent 4 values it at 31
   - **Allocate to Agent 3**

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 65
   - Agent 1 values it at 36
   - Agent 2 values it at 56
   - Agent 3 values it at 28
   - Agent 4 values it at 4
   - **Allocate to Agent 0** (highest)

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 80 (highest)
   - Agent 1 values it at 11
   - Agent 2 values it at 74
   - Agent 3 values it at 50
   - Agent 4 values it at 12
   - **Allocate to Agent 0**

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 63
   - Agent 1 values it at 71 (highest)
   - Agent 2 values it at 35
   - Agent 3 values it at 38
   - Agent 4 values it at 13
   - **Allocate to Agent 1**

Now let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that only and at least 6 items are allocated in total.
