Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  20  36  43  70  19
1  73  16  33   5  33   8
2   1  61  18   5  97  56
3  81  58  93  20  35  56
4  27  99  77  17  49  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives from the items allocated to them. Below is one way to allocate the items based on the given valuations:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 | Total Value |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|
| 0     | 41     |        | 36     |        | 70     |        | 147         |
| 1     |        |        |        | 5      |        | 8      | 13          |
| 2     |        | 61     |        |        |        | 56     | 117         |
| 3     | 81     |        | 93     |        |        |        | 174         |
| 4     |        | 99     |        | 17     |        |        | 116         |

Allocation:
- Agent 0 gets items 0, 2, and 4
- Agent 1 gets items 3 and 5
- Agent 2 gets items 1 and 5
- Agent 3 gets items 0 and 2
- Agent 4 gets items 1 and 3

However, to ensure each agent gets an integer number of items and all six items are allocated, I will provide a specific allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Items 0, 3
- Agent 4: Item 1

JSON format of the allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
``` 

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are assigned, and each agent receives at least one item.
