Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  99  70  13  81  19
1  71  30  65  99  89  11
2   5  52  33  86  54  77
3  33  76  95  57  34  92
4  16  41  87  68  95  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[25 99 70 13 81 19]
 [71 30 65 99 89 11]
 [ 5 52 33 86 54 77]
 [33 76 95 57 34 92]
 [16 41 87 68 95 33]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the method of maximizing the total valuation by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. This involves selecting the highest value for each item and assigning the item to the respective agent.

Let's proceed with the allocations:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent 0 valuation: 25
   - Agent 1 valuation: 71 (highest)
   - Agent 2 valuation: 5
   - Agent 3 valuation: 33
   - Agent 4 valuation: 16
   - **Assign item 0 to agent 1**

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 0 valuation: 99 (highest)
   - Agent 1 valuation: 30
   - Agent 2 valuation: 52
   - Agent 3 valuation: 76
   - Agent 4 valuation: 41
   - **Assign item 1 to agent 0**

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 valuation: 70
   - Agent 1 valuation: 65
   - Agent 2 valuation: 33
   - Agent 3 valuation: 95 (highest)
   - Agent 4 valuation: 87
   - **Assign item 2 to agent 3**

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 0 valuation: 13
   - Agent 1 valuation: 99 (highest)
   - Agent 2 valuation: 86
   - Agent 3 valuation: 57
   - Agent 4 valuation: 68
   - **Assign item 3 to agent 1**

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 0 valuation: 81
   - Agent 1 valuation: 89 (highest)
   - Agent 2 valuation: 54
   - Agent 3 valuation: 34
   - Agent 4 valuation: 95 (highest)
   - Since there is a tie, we can choose based on other criteria. Here, let's assign item 4 to agent 4 for a better balance.
   - **Assign item 4 to agent 4**

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 valuation: 19
   - Agent 1 valuation: 11
   - Agent 2 valuation: 77 (highest)
   - Agent 3 valuation: 92 (highest)
   - Agent 4 valuation: 33
   - Again, there is a tie; let's assign item 5 to agent 3 for balance.
   - **Assign item 5 to agent 3**

Now, let's summarize the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the valuations, and each agent is considered in the allocation process.
