Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  56  54  76  97  27
1  65  80  76  23  54  76
2  46  22  42  43  73  78
3   3  82  80  49  65  53
4  60  25  21  39  72  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that every item is allocated to exactly one agent. To do this, we can use a greedy approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that no agent receives more items than others (unless unavoidable given the total number of items).

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values item 0 the most at 72.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values item 1 the most at 82.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 3 values item 2 the most at 80.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 0 values item 3 the most at 76.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values item 4 the most at 97.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 2 values item 5 the most at 78.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets a fair share, and redistribute if necessary:

- Agent 0 has 3 items (0, 3, 4).
- Agent 1 has 0 items.
- Agent 2 has 1 item (5).
- Agent 3 has 2 items (1, 2).
- Agent 4 has 0 items.

Agent 0 has more items than others, so we need to redistribute to ensure fairness. We can move one item from Agent 0 to Agent 1 or Agent 4.

Let's move item 3 from Agent 0 to Agent 1.

Now, the allocation looks like this:

- Agent 0 has items (0, 4).
- Agent 1 has item (3).
- Agent 2 has item (5).
- Agent 3 has items (1, 2).
- Agent 4 has no items.

This allocation fairly distributes the items, with each agent getting at least one item (except Agent 4 who gets none due to the total count limitation).

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": []
}
```
