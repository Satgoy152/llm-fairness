Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 29.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  77  43   8  33   9
1  85   8  29   8  57  83
2  63  42  61  85  50   0
3  46  54  18  95  54   6
4  93  24  30  41  35  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. One approach to achieve this is to use a greedy algorithm where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, provided that the allocation doesn't result in some agents receiving no items at all.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 4 values item 0 the most with a value of 93.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 0 values item 1 the most with a value of 77.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values item 2 the most with a value of 43.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 3 values item 3 the most with a value of 95.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 1 values item 4 the most with a value of 57.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values item 5 the most with a value of 83.

With this allocation, agents 0, 1, 3, and 4 receive items, while agent 2 does not receive any. To ensure each agent receives at least one item, we need to adjust the allocation. Here's a revised allocation:

1. Agent 0 gets item 1.
2. Agent 1 gets items 4 and 5.
3. Agent 2 gets item 0.
4. Agent 3 gets item 3.
5. Agent 4 gets item 2.

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4, 5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
