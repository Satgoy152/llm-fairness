Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  75  24  71  80  74
1   1   5  42  37  95  89
2  53  32  73  98  26   5
3  50  28  19  85  52  46
4  12  80  91  23   3  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One approach is to assign items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for Agent 0 is 80 for item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for Agent 1 is 95 for item 4, but since it's already allocated to Agent 0, we look at the next highest, which is 89 for item 5.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for Agent 2 is 98 for item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for Agent 3 is 85 for item 3, but it's already allocated to Agent 2, so the next highest is 52 for item 4, but it's allocated to Agent 0. Next is 50 for item 0.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for Agent 4 is 91 for item 2.

Now, we need to ensure all items are allocated:

- Item 1: Not yet allocated. The highest available valuation for item 1 is by Agent 0 (75).

Let's list the allocations:

- Agent 0: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 1: Item [5]
- Agent 2: Item [3]
- Agent 3: Item [0]
- Agent 4: Item [2]

Finally, here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
