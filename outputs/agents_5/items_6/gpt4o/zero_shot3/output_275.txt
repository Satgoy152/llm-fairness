Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  65  42  33  20   6
1  74  81  92  98  63  93
2  73  66  57  47  62  25
3  22  39  36  74  32  70
4   9  57  97  98  13  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [74 81 92 98 63 93]
 [73 66 57 47 62 25]

 [ 9 57 97 98 13 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's allocate the items using a method that considers the highest valuations first:

1. **Agent 0**: Since Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1 (65), let's assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 has multiple high valuations, but their highest for an unallocated item is item 3 (98). Let's assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 2 at 97, which is the highest among unallocated items. Assign item 2 to Agent 4.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3's highest valuation among the remaining items is item 5 (70). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 at 73, which is the highest available for them. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.
6. **Agent 1**: Agent 1's next highest valuation among remaining items is item 4 (63). Assign item 4 to Agent 1.

Let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
