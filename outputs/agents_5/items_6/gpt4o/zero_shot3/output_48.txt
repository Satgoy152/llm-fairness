Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  70   4  99  41  80
1  26  35  48  99  90  86
2  62  60  87  39   7  82
3   6  27  14  97  10  81
4  52  56  50  55  79  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items in such a way that each agent gets an approximately equal total value based on their valuations. Given the valuations, our objective is to maximize each agentâ€™s satisfaction with their allocated items.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Determine the highest value for each agent**: Start by identifying which item each agent values the most. This can guide initial allocations.

2. **Avoid conflicts**: If two agents value the same item the most, consider the second-highest value item they prefer, or evaluate other agents' needs to balance the allocation.

3. **Iterate through each item**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, if possible, and ensure that no agent is left without an item unless necessary.

4. **Optimize the distribution**: Reassign items if necessary to ensure a fair distribution, considering both the number of items and the total value each agent receives.

Based on the above strategy, here is a proposed allocation of items:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most.
- Agent 1 values items 4 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 3 values item 3 highly but will settle for item 5 due to agent 0's higher bid on item 3.
- Agent 4 values item 4 highly but will settle for item 1 due to agent 1's higher bid on item 4.

Considering the above points, the final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest preferences while distributing the items fairly.
