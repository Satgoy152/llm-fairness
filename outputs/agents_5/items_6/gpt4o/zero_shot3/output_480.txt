Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  42  43  59  91  83
1  41  23  78  65   7  76
2  60  58  80   8  95  18
3  81  77  59  43  37  85
4  13   4  34  84  29  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share according to their preferences.

Given the valuations, one possible approach is to use a method such as maximizing the total valuation for all agents or using a fair division algorithm like envy-freeness or maximin share.

To achieve a fair allocation, let's use a method that tries to maximize the total utility for all agents, which can often yield a balanced distribution.

Here is one possible allocation:

- Assign item 4 to agent 2 (valuation 95)
- Assign item 5 to agent 3 (valuation 85)
- Assign item 3 to agent 1 (valuation 65)
- Assign item 0 to agent 3 (valuation 81)
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 (valuation 42)
- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (valuation 43)

This allocation gives each agent a fair share of the items based on their valuations.

Now, let's present this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, while trying to respect their preferences as much as possible.
