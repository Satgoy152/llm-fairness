Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11  45  22  49  64  17
1  61  85  46  14  37  88
2  44  10   2  89  18  26
3  20  18  30  78  22  16
4  12  70  81  47  80  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives, ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated. A straightforward approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's the step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 61.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 85.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 81.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 89.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 64.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 88.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives items according to their highest valuations.
