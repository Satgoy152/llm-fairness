Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9   6  19  27   4  22
1  88   7  84  48  98   7
2  96   5  49  67  39  50
3  31  83  37  74  38  16
4  52  50  87  43  82   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [88  7 84 48 98  7]
 [96  5 49 67 39 50]

 [52 50 87 43 82  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent or ensure some form of fairness like envy-freeness. Given the valuations, one way is to give each agent the item for which they have the highest valuation, as long as no two agents have their maximum valuation on the same item. If conflicts arise, we can resolve them by considering the second-highest valuation or another method to ensure fairness.

Hereâ€™s a potential allocation using the given table:

1. Agent 0: Their highest value is for item 3 with a value of 27.
2. Agent 1: Their highest value is for item 4 with a value of 98.
3. Agent 2: Their highest value is for item 0 with a value of 96.
4. Agent 3: Their highest value is for item 1 with a value of 83.
5. Agent 4: Their highest value is for item 2 with a value of 87.

This gives each agent their highest valued item. Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate one more item to ensure all 6 items are distributed.

Agent 0: [3]
Agent 1: [4]
Agent 2: [0]
Agent 3: [1]
Agent 4: [2, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```
