Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  19  42  53  45   0
1  48   2  67  43  58  85
2  87  52  25  49  81  87
3  12  10  49  74  12  74
4  57  68  89  87  79  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach where we try to maximize the total valuation for each agent, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. However, since there are more agents than items in this scenario (5 agents and 6 items), one agent will end up with no items. 

Let's work through a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest value for Agent 0 is item 3 (value: 53).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest value for Agent 1 is item 5 (value: 85).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest value for Agent 2 is item 0 (value: 87).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest value for Agent 3 is item 3 (value: 74). But item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we consider the next best option.
   - Next highest value is for item 5 (value: 74), but item 5 is already allocated to Agent 1, so we consider the next best option.
   - Next highest value is for item 2 (value: 49).

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest value for Agent 4 is item 2 (value: 89), but item 2 is already allocated to Agent 3, so we consider the next best option.
   - Next highest value is for item 3 (value: 87), but item 3 is already allocated to Agent 0, so we consider the next best option.
   - Next highest value is for item 4 (value: 79).

Next, we check the remaining unallocated items:

- Item 1 is unallocated.

Given the above allocation and that one agent must not receive any items, we'll choose to leave Agent 3 without any items, as they have the lowest maximum value for any single item compared to the other agents. Thus, we reassign item 2 to Agent 4 and item 4 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Item 3
2. **Agent 1:** Item 5
3. **Agent 2:** Item 0
4. **Agent 3:** No items
5. **Agent 4:** Items 2 and 4
6. **Remaining item 1 goes to Agent 0 for a better balance.**

The final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```
