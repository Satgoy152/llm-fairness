Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 58.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  42  12  58  74  61
1  26  79  58  26  33  37
2  69  99  96  18  86  79
3  96   9  40  41  45   4
4  71  40  81  25  69  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated in total. Here's one way to achieve this:

1. **Agent 0**: This agent values item 4 the most (74). We allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: This agent values item 1 the most (79). We allocate item 1 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: This agent values item 1 the most (99), but it's already taken. The next highest value is item 2 (96). We allocate item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: This agent values item 0 the most (96). We allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: This agent values item 2 the most (81), but it's already taken. The next highest value is item 0 (71), but it's also taken. The next highest value is item 4 (69), but it's also taken. The next highest value is item 5 (38). We allocate item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, only item 3 is left unallocated. Let's allocate item 3 to Agent 0, who values it 58.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```
