Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  69  99  14  85   9
1  11  81  96  15  17   9
2  19  68   3  48  51  59
3  43  40   1   8  40  57
4  14  28   7  60  70   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 69 99 14 85  9]
 [11 81 96 15 17  9]
 [19 68  3 48 51 59]
 [43 40  1  8 40 57]
 [14 28  7 60 70  7]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that every agent receives at least one item. Since there are six items and five agents, one agent will receive two items while the others will receive one each.

Based on the given valuations, the allocation could be optimized as follows:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 4. We could assign item 2 to Agent 0 since it has the highest valuation (99) among all items for Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2, but it's already taken, so we assign item 1 to Agent 1 since it's the next highest valuation.
3. Agent 2 has a high valuation for item 5, making it a suitable choice.
4. Agent 3 has a relatively high valuation for item 0, which can be assigned to them.
5. Agent 4 can take item 4, as it has the highest valuation for that agent.

Since there are six items, one agent needs to receive an additional item. Agent 0 has a high valuation for item 0 as well, so it can receive item 0 in addition to item 2.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

Note: Upon review, ensure that each agent has at least one item and that all items are allocated as per the problem constraint. Adjust allocations if necessary to achieve fairness based on specific criteria such as maximizing total valuation or minimizing envy, depending on additional information or context.
