Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 24.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  55  78  31  58  13
1  61  30  24  23  94   6
2   8  33  79  79   7  56
3  81  92  26   8  79   6
4  71  34  91  60  17   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's a step-by-step process to achieve this:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation**: For each item, find out which agent values it the most.
2. **Assign the Item**: Allocate the item to the agent with the highest valuation.
3. **Ensure Fairness**: If an agent has already received an item, consider other agents for subsequent items to maintain fairness.

Following these steps, the allocation is as follows:

- For item 0, agent 0 has the highest valuation (84).
- For item 1, agent 3 has the highest valuation (92).
- For item 2, agent 4 has the highest valuation (91).
- For item 3, agents 2 and 3 are tied with the highest valuation (79). To ensure fairness, we assign this item to agent 2.
- For item 4, agent 1 has the highest valuation (94).
- For item 5, agent 2 has the highest valuation (56).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while also considering fairness by distributing items across agents.
