Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35   8   8  48  15  11
1  23  93  70  87  92  23
2  47  91  48   3  97  22
3  93  79  26  80  70  24
4  98  18   6  96  59  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[35  8  8 48 15 11]
 [23 93 70 87 92 23]
 [47 91 48  3 97 22]
 [93 79 26 80 70 24]
 [98 18  6 96 59 61]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. We can use a greedy approach to start by allocating items to the agents who value them the most. Here is a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 98.
   - Assign item 0 to agent 4.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 93.
   - Assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 70.
   - Assign item 2 to agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 96.
   - Assign item 3 to agent 4.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest valuation is by agent 2 with a value of 97.
   - Assign item 4 to agent 2.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest valuation is by agent 4 with a value of 61.
   - Assign item 5 to agent 4.

Now, let's ensure every agent is included in the allocation even if they have no items:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items have been assigned and each agent is considered in the final JSON output.
