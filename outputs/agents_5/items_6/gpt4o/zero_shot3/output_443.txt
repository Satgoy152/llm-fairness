Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 7.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  44  93  74  42  72
1  25  53   7  58  15  58
2  12  16  14  61  34  27
3  59   8  47  47  43   8
4  93  72  67  29  93  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and aim for a distribution that maximizes fairness. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one each, or some agents may receive none if that results in a fairer distribution.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3.
2. **Agent 1** has moderate valuations for items 1, 3, and 5.
3. **Agent 2** has relatively low valuations overall; item 3 is valued the highest.
4. **Agent 3** has a decent value for item 0, but no strong preference otherwise.
5. **Agent 4** has very high valuations for items 0 and 4.

To allocate fairly, we aim to maximize the total value each agent perceives from their allocated items while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent. Let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Considering their high valuations, allocate item 2 (value 93).
- **Agent 1**: Allocate item 5 (value 58).
- **Agent 2**: Allocate item 3 (value 61).
- **Agent 3**: Allocate item 1 (value 8).
- **Agent 4**: Allocate items 0 and 4 (values 93 and 93).

This distribution attempts to give each agent at least one item they value highly, and it maximizes the overall satisfaction based on the given valuations. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
