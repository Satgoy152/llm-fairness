Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 4.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71  34  77  85  45   5
1   3  67   4  71  61  39
2  40  53  44  26  41  78
3  98  21   0  42  82   5
4  94  32  11  73  96  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, let's aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations while ensuring each item is allocated to one agent. Here's one way to approach the allocation:

1. Identify the highest valuation for each item, and allocate the item to the respective agent.
2. Make sure each agent receives at least one item and adjust allocations to balance the distribution if needed.

Following these steps, here is a fair allocation of the items:

- Item 0: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (98).
- Item 1: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (67).
- Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (77).
- Item 3: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (85).
- Item 4: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (96).
- Item 5: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (78).

Now let's present these allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated once and every agent receives at least one item, except for any adjustments that might be necessary to balance the distribution better according to additional fairness criteria.
