Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  32  19  94  59  91
1   8  69  83  61  66  51
2  11  74  36  79  12  15
3  97  27  42  81  86  39
4  14  29  75  51  74  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here is one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0: This agent values item 3 highly (94), so we will allocate this item to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1: This agent values item 2 highly (83), so we will allocate this item to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2: This agent values item 1 highly (74), so we will allocate this item to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3: This agent values item 0 highly (97), so we will allocate this item to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4: This agent values item 5 highly (91), so we will allocate this item to Agent 4.
6. For the remaining item 4, Agent 3 has the second-highest valuation (86), so we allocate item 4 to Agent 3.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.
