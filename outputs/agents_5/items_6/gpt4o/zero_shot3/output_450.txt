Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  29  51  11  37  29
1  91  55  54  67  57  62
2  51   0  64  57   4  41
3  12  64  29  21  66  34
4  19  90  22  21  58  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value for each agent, ensuring each agent receives at least one item. The goal is to distribute the items so that each agent's perceived value is maximized given their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0 and 2.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations for item 2.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 4.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 1 and 5.

A possible allocation that maximizes each agent's satisfaction could be:

- Agent 0: Item 0
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Items 1 and 5

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution takes into account their highest valuation preferences.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
