Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  42   4  85  73  54
1  27   6  83  64  47  96
2  30  72  35  85  63  91
3  64  81  46  14  26  91
4  64  66  17  58  95  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider the valuations of each agent for each item. One approach is to maximize the total valuation by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Another approach is to try to balance the total valuation each agent receives. Below is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item and allocate it to the respective agent:**
   - Item 0: Highest value is 64 by agents 3 and 4.
   - Item 1: Highest value is 81 by agent 3.
   - Item 2: Highest value is 83 by agent 1.
   - Item 3: Highest value is 85 by agents 0 and 2.
   - Item 4: Highest value is 95 by agent 4.
   - Item 5: Highest value is 96 by agent 1.

2. **Resolve ties and ensure each agent gets at least one item when possible:**
   - For item 0, assign to agent 3 (first highest).
   - For item 3, assign to agent 0 (first highest).

3. **Allocate remaining items:**
   - Ensure no agent receives more than 2 items unless unavoidable.

4. **Final Allocation:**
   - Agent 0: Items 3
   - Agent 1: Items 2, 5
   - Agent 2: Item none
   - Agent 3: Items 0, 1
   - Agent 4: Item 4

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
