Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  97   5  86  34  90
1  83  14  70  47  48  13
2  13  67  84  10  10  61
3  31  69  56  60  81  36
4  93  26  80  70  11  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. We'll start by assigning items to the agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. This will help balance the allocations and ensure that the total number of items allocated is six.

Here's a step-by-step approach to the allocation:

1. List down the items and sort them based on the highest valuation by any agent.
2. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item.

Let's perform the allocation:

1. Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 4 (93).
2. Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 0 (97).
3. Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 2 (84).
4. Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 0 (86).
5. Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 3 (81).
6. Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 0 (90).

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0 has items 1, 3, 5.
- Agent 1 has no items yet, but Agent 0 has three items. Let's transfer item 5 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 has item 2.
- Agent 3 has item 4.
- Agent 4 has item 0.

This gives us:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 3
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 4
- Agent 4: Item 0

In JSON format, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```
