Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 95.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  14  68  19  84  83
1  92  39  95  34  85  44
2  63  14   4  80  43  49
3  47  75  66  13  78  86
4  96   2  19  86   5  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that maximizes total valuations while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. A simple way to achieve this is to assign items based on the highest value each agent has for the items, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item, ensuring no two agents receive the same item.
2. If an agent cannot be assigned their highest-valued item (because another agent with a higher valuation has already taken it), assign the next highest available item.
3. Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Following this approach, here is one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (value 88).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the most (value 95).
- Agent 2 values item 3 the most (value 80).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most (value 86).
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most (value 5).

Now, we need to check if every agent has at least one item and no item is allocated more than once. If any agent has no items, we reallocate from agents with more than one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures every agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
