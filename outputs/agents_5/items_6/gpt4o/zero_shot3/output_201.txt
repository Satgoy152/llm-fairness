Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  53  95  78   0  96
1  44  62  35  16  15  58
2  74  24  81  76  86  99
3  59  34   1  34  17  81
4  60  60  36  17  71  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will inevitably receive two items. We aim to allocate items in a way that fairly distributes the total value received by each agent.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent assigns to any single item, and initially allocate that item to the corresponding agent.
2. Re-allocate if necessary to ensure each agent has at least one item, while also maximizing the total value across all agents.

Let's go through the allocation step-by-step:

- Agent 0 highly values item 5 (value 96).
- Agent 1 highly values item 1 (value 62).
- Agent 2 highly values item 5 (value 99), but since item 5 is already taken by Agent 0, we look for the next highest, which is item 4 (value 86).
- Agent 3 highly values item 5 (value 81), but item 5 is already taken. The next highest is item 0 (value 59).
- Agent 4 highly values item 5 (value 94), but item 5 is already taken. The next highest is item 0 (value 60), but item 0 is already taken by Agent 3. The next highest is item 1 (value 60), but item 1 is already taken by Agent 1. The next highest is item 4 (value 71), but item 4 is already taken by Agent 2. Finally, we assign item 3 (value 17) to Agent 4.

Now, let's ensure every agent gets at least one item:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 4
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 3

Only item 2 remains unallocated. We can assign item 2 to Agent 0, as they value it quite highly (value 95).

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, each agent receives at least one item, and the total value across all agents is reasonably balanced.
