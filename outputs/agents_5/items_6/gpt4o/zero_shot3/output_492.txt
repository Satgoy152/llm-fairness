Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 80.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  57  39  63  91  36
1  48  23  80   6  45   1
2  29   5  42  98  85  48
3  78  11  13  72  18  76
4  75  50  35   8   6  19

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives from their allocated items. One possible approach is to assign each item to the agent that values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item wherever possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 78 by Agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 57 by Agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 80 by Agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 98 by Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 91 by Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 76 by Agent 3.

Now, let's distribute the items:

- Agent 0: Items 1 and 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 0 and 5
- Agent 4: No items

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": []
}
```
