Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 3.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  15  23  69  90   8
1  38  93   3  87  38  88
2  92   8   8  54  65  43
3  99  68  75  29  22  82
4  82  39  33  54  68   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to distribute the items in a way that considers their valuations, ensuring each agent receives at least one item and that all six items are allocated. We'll try to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their individual valuations of the items. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** highly values item 4 (90) and item 3 (69). Allocating item 4 to Agent 0 would be significant for them.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 1 (93). Allocating item 1 to Agent 1 would maximize their satisfaction.
3. **Agent 2** highly values item 0 (92). Allocating item 0 to Agent 2 would be optimal for them.
4. **Agent 3** highly values item 0 (99), but since item 0 is already allocated, we can consider item 2 (75) for Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 3 and item 4 similarly (54 and 68). Since item 4 is allocated, we can allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

Now we need to ensure all items are allocated, and no agent is left without an item. With the above considerations, we allocate the remaining items:

- Item 5 can be allocated to Agent 0, as it has a decent value (8) compared to their other remaining options.

With these considerations, the allocation might look like this:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all six items are distributed.
