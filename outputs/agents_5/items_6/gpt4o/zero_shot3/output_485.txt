Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 96.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  20  90  93  96  45
1  64  27  96  27  68  90
2  93   2  20  63   4  96
3   7  84  34  11  36  57
4  85  56  33  26  61  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 6 20 90 93 96 45]
 [64 27 96 27 68 90]
 [93  2 20 63  4 96]

 [85 56 33 26 61 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that maximizes each agent's total valuation for the items they receive. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, we need to decide which agent will receive more than one item, or if all agents receive one item with one agent receiving none. 

Let's consider the valuations table:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   6  20  90  93  96  45
1  64  27  96  27  68  90
2  93   2  20  63   4  96
3   7  84  34  11  36  57
4  85  56  33  26  61  14
```

We'll attempt to allocate the items such that the total valuation for each agent is maximized while ensuring each item is allocated to only one agent. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.
2. If conflicts arise (more than one item best valued by the same agent), adjust by considering second-best allocations until all items are distributed.

By examining the table, we can make the following allocations:

- Item 0: Best valued by Agent 2 (93)
- Item 1: Best valued by Agent 3 (84)
- Item 2: Best valued by Agent 1 (96)
- Item 3: Best valued by Agent 0 (93)
- Item 4: Best valued by Agent 0 (96) 
- Item 5: Best valued by Agent 2 (96)

To allocate fairly, we need to ensure all agents get a reasonable share. Hence, we can make the following adjustments:

- Give Item 0 to Agent 4 (85) instead of Agent 2
- Give Item 5 to Agent 1 (90) instead of Agent 2

Now we can finalize the allocation:

- Agent 0: Items 3, 4
- Agent 1: Items 2, 5
- Agent 2: No items
- Agent 3: Item 1
- Agent 4: Item 0

The JSON format of this allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents with no agent receiving more than two items.
