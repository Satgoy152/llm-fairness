Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 35.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20   2  14  55  33  78
1  69  41  35  93  84  15
2   5  48  49  69  74  40
3  99  63   2  22  31  86
4  27   5  42  29  73  22

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we'll aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a reasonable share based on their valuations. One common approach is to use the "maximum marginal utility" method, where we assign items one by one to the agent who values them the most at each step.

Let's go through the allocation process step by step:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 99. Assign item 0 to agent 3.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 63. Assign item 1 to agent 3.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 49. Assign item 2 to agent 2.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 93. Assign item 3 to agent 1.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 84. Assign item 4 to agent 1.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 0 values it the most at 78. Assign item 5 to agent 0.

Now, we can present the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 1],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.
