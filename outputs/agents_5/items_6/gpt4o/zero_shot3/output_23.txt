Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  35  90  49  15  61  98
1  85   7  67  23  51  25
2   7  40  73  46  82  97
3  36  67  42  47   1  71
4  68  55  88  44  38  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall value while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One possible approach is to assign items based on the highest valuation by each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

1. Assign each agent their highest valued item that hasn't already been assigned, ensuring all agents receive at least one item.
2. Once each agent has at least one item, allocate the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0: Highest value is 98 for item 5.
- Agent 1: Highest value is 85 for item 0.
- Agent 2: Highest value is 97 for item 5 but it's taken, so next highest is 82 for item 4.
- Agent 3: Highest value is 71 for item 5 but it's taken, so next highest is 67 for item 1.
- Agent 4: Highest value is 88 for item 2.

Now, assign the remaining items:

- Item 3 and item 5 remain.
- Agent 0 already has item 5, so they can't get another item.
- Agent 1 can take item 3, as it is the highest remaining value for them.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that all items are distributed.
