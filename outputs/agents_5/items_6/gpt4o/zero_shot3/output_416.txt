Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   3   8  38  47  81  66
1  19  57  67  69  32  82
2  89  89  44  80  17  99
3  27  90  83  62  10  66
4   8  61  39  19  25  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items so that agents receive items based on their valuations, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item, if possible, and all items are distributed. Let's consider the valuation table and attempt to maximize fairness by ensuring each agent receives items for which they have relatively high valuations.

One approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest preferences while ensuring all items are distributed. Let's assign items while considering the distribution:

1. Identify each agent's highest valued items.
2. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuations in a way that ensures all items are allocated.

Using this approach, allocations might look like this:

- Agent 0 gets item 4 (value: 81)
- Agent 1 gets item 5 (value: 82)
- Agent 2 gets item 0 (value: 89)
- Agent 3 gets item 1 (value: 90)
- Agent 4 gets item 2 (value: 39)
- Since each agent must receive at least one item, we can assign the remaining item 3 to Agent 3 due to its high valuation (62).

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, with each agent receiving items they value highly.
