Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  75   8  71  61  85
1  62  31  34  96  41  58
2  32   1  90  10  80   8
3  78  73   3  37  19  43
4  52  23  83  16  91   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 23 83 16 91  8]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value (78) is from agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value (75) is from agent 0.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value (90) is from agent 2.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value (96) is from agent 1.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value (91) is from agent 4.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value (85) is from agent 0.

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, while each agent gets an integer number of items. All items are accounted for in the allocation.
