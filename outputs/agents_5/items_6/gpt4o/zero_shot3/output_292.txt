Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  44  43  71  40  52
1  65  86  54  79   2  55
2  80  86  59  37  27  18
3  54   1   0  89  99  90
4  29  17  57  74   0  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to distribute the 6 items such that each agent gets an integer number of items and the allocation is fair based on their valuations. A common approach is to use a greedy method where we allocate items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here is one possible fair allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 3 the most (71).
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (86).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (80).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most (99).
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most (69).

After these allocations, item 2 remains unallocated. We can allocate item 2 to the agent who values it the most among those who haven't received their highest-valued item yet or based on an even distribution approach.

Here's a possible allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items [3].
- Agent 1 gets items [1].
- Agent 2 gets items [0].
- Agent 3 gets items [4].
- Agent 4 gets items [5, 2].

This ensures that all agents receive at least one item where possible, and all items are allocated fairly according to the highest valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```
