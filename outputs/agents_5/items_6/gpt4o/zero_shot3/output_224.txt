Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  79  24  48   8  72
1  53   5   9  70  67  33
2  87  73  24  41  29   5
3  51  92  49  95  27  80
4  87   5  53   8  57  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[88 79 24 48  8 72]
 [53  5  9 70 67 33]
 [87 73 24 41 29  5]
 [51 92 49 95 27 80]
 [87  5 53  8 57 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations and try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Given there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will end up with two items while others will get one item each.

Let's start by analyzing the valuations and allocations:

1. Assign item 3 to agent 3 since it has the highest value of 95.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 0 since it has the highest value of 88.
3. Assign item 1 to agent 3 since it has the second-highest value of 92.
4. Assign item 5 to agent 0 since it has the second-highest value of 72.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 4 since it has the highest value of 53.
6. Assign item 4 to agent 1 since it has the highest value of 67.

Thus, the allocation is:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 5
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: No item
- Agent 3: Items 1, 3
- Agent 4: Item 2

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
