Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60   0  17  30  46  90
1  65  87  39   1  32  67
2  97  53   0  47  58  71
3  33  78  92  72   0  29
4  80  99  73  13  47  33

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction of all agents. A common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible. However, since there are 6 items and 5 agents, one agent will inevitably receive two items.

Let's analyze the values and make allocations:

- Item 0: Highest value is 97 by agent 2.
- Item 1: Highest value is 99 by agent 4.
- Item 2: Highest value is 92 by agent 3.
- Item 3: Highest value is 72 by agent 3 (Agent 3 has highest value again, so choose next highest for diversity).
- Item 4: Highest value is 58 by agent 2.
- Item 5: Highest value is 90 by agent 0.

Now let's assign these items while ensuring fair distribution:

- Agent 2 gets item 0.
- Agent 4 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 2.
- Agent 0 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 also gets item 3 (since they have the second highest value for item 3 and already have an item).
- Agent 2 gets item 4.

This results in the following allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute items fairly based on the highest valuations while ensuring that one agent receives two items due to the total number of items being more than the number of agents.
