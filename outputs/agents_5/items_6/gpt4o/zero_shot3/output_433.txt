Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  25  80  32  60  30
1   0   2  32   4   2   6
2  86  19  29  40  27  39
3  63  66  85  78  19  60
4  90  52  97  78  69  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. One approach is to allocate items to agents who value them the most, while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0 and 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has low valuations overall. Assign item 5 to Agent 1, which is the highest valued item for this agent.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 0 to Agent 2, as it's the highest valued item for this agent.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 3 to Agent 3, as it's among the highest for this agent and not yet taken.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 4 to Agent 4, as it's a high value for this agent.

Now we have items 1 and 4 remaining, with Agent 4 already having one item. Since Agent 4 values item 1 more than any other agent, assign item 1 to Agent 4 as well.

Allocations:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [1, 4]

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
