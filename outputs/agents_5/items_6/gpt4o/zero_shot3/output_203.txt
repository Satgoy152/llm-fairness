Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  88  52   5  57  97
1  54  37  53   4  97  59
2  30  30  93  64  32  46
3  85   9  66  26  26  17
4  95  84  31  81  35  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items. A common approach is to use a method like the Maximum Weighted Matching or a heuristic that maximizes total happiness or fairness. Here, we try to ensure that each item is allocated in a way that maximizes the total value given the constraints.

Let's allocate the items step by step:

1. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (value 98).
2. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 97).
3. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 88).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (value 81).
5. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 93).
6. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (value 95).

Now let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item by re-evaluating the distribution if necessary:

- Agent 0 has item 1.
- Agent 1 has item 4.
- Agent 2 has item 2.
- Agent 3 currently has no item, so we need to adjust. Let's give agent 3 item 3 instead of agent 4.
- Agent 4 has items 0 and 5.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```
