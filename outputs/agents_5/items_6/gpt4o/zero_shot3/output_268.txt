Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99  25  80  87  45  77
1  87  87  71  92  52  73
2  99  66  29  73  44  28
3  32  15  56  16  54  77
4  51   6  40  72  15   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. The simplest approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's the detailed allocation:

1. Item 0: 
   - Agent 0 values it at 99
   - Agent 2 values it at 99
   - Agent 1 values it at 87
   - Agent 4 values it at 51
   - Agent 3 values it at 32

   Both agents 0 and 2 have the highest value for item 0. We can assign it to agent 0.

2. Item 1:
   - Agent 1 values it at 87
   - Agent 2 values it at 66
   - Agent 0 values it at 25
   - Agent 3 values it at 15
   - Agent 4 values it at 6

   Agent 1 values it the most. Assign item 1 to agent 1.

3. Item 2:
   - Agent 0 values it at 80
   - Agent 1 values it at 71
   - Agent 3 values it at 56
   - Agent 4 values it at 40
   - Agent 2 values it at 29

   Agent 0 values it the most. Assign item 2 to agent 0.

4. Item 3:
   - Agent 1 values it at 92
   - Agent 0 values it at 87
   - Agent 2 values it at 73
   - Agent 4 values it at 72
   - Agent 3 values it at 16

   Agent 1 values it the most. Assign item 3 to agent 1.

5. Item 4:
   - Agent 1 values it at 52
   - Agent 3 values it at 54
   - Agent 0 values it at 45
   - Agent 2 values it at 44
   - Agent 4 values it at 15

   Agent 3 values it the most. Assign item 4 to agent 3.

6. Item 5:
   - Agent 0 values it at 77
   - Agent 3 values it at 77
   - Agent 1 values it at 73
   - Agent 2 values it at 28
   - Agent 4 values it at 4

   Both agents 0 and 3 have the highest value for item 5. We can assign it to agent 3.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1, 3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 5],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation, every item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring a fair distribution based on the given values.
