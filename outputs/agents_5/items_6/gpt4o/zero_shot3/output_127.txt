Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25  72  96  23  15  53
1  97  58  27  18  67  55
2   6   8  89  97  39  49
3  62  42  11  23   1  53
4  68  66   9  15  26  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every agent gets at least one item and all items are distributed. Given the valuations provided in the table, let's proceed with a potential allocation strategy:

### Approach:
1. **Assign items to the agent who values them the most:** This is a straightforward approach and commonly results in a fair distribution when each agent can only receive one item.
2. **Reevaluate to ensure all items are allocated:** Adjust allocations if some items are unassigned or if an agent does not receive any item.

Let's allocate the items based on the highest value each agent places on them:

- **Item 0:** Agent 1 values it the most at 97.
- **Item 1:** Agent 0 values it the most at 72.
- **Item 2:** Agent 0 values it the most at 96.
- **Item 3:** Agent 2 values it the most at 97.
- **Item 4:** Agent 1 values it the most at 67.
- **Item 5:** Agent 4 values it the most at 65.

### Adjustments:
- Since Agent 0 has two items, we need to reallocate one of them. Agent 0 can keep Item 2, and we reassign Item 1 to another agent.
- Agent 3 does not have any item, so we can give them Item 1. 

### Final Allocation:
After adjustments, the final allocation would be:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuation preferences.
