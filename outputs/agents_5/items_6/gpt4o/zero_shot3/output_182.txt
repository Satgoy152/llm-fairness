Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  57  63  93  92  67
1  42  46  67  44  29  57
2  54  10  94  39  40  45
3  31  71  63  26  95  54
4  70  45  68  87  83   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent's allocated items. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm where each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Look at each item and assign it to the agent who values it the most.
2. Ensure that each agent gets an integer number of items.
3. Verify that all 6 items are allocated.

Let's go through the items:

- Item 0: The highest valuation is 70 by Agent 4.
- Item 1: The highest valuation is 71 by Agent 3.
- Item 2: The highest valuation is 94 by Agent 2.
- Item 3: The highest valuation is 93 by Agent 0.
- Item 4: The highest valuation is 95 by Agent 3.
- Item 5: The highest valuation is 67 by Agent 0.

This allocation maximizes the total value for each agent's items:

- Agent 0 gets items 3 and 5.
- Agent 1 gets no items.
- Agent 2 gets item 2.
- Agent 3 gets items 1 and 4.
- Agent 4 gets item 0.

Now, representing this allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1, 4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated.
