Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  60  11  29  37  40  30
1   3  48  16  63  21  76
2  37  96   0   6  64  97
3   8  47  29  52  15  54
4  73  62  69  82  44   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided in the table. A common approach is to use a strategy that maximizes the minimum satisfaction among the agents or aims for an equitable distribution based on the given valuations. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0** has a high valuation for item 0.
2. **Agent 1** has a high valuation for item 5.
3. **Agent 2** has a high valuation for item 1.
4. **Agent 3** has a reasonably high valuation for item 3.
5. **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 4.

Now, let's assign the items to each agent to distribute them fairly:

- Assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to agent 1.
- Assign item 1 to agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to agent 3.
- Assign item 4 to agent 4.

Now, there is one item left (item 2) that needs to be allocated. Let's assign this item to the agent whose total valuation would benefit the most from it:

- Assign item 2 to agent 0 (as this gives agent 0 two items with reasonable valuations).

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation tries to respect each agent's preferences while ensuring that all items are allocated.
