Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  14  39  25  68  34
1  18  69  23  72  44  39
2  90  46   8  59  31   0
3  20  15  17  54  90  42
4  17  19  31  89  13  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, a common approach is to maximize the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent or ensure that each agent receives at least one item they highly value. Here, we'll try to distribute the items by considering the highest valuations for each agent and ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. Identify each agent's highest-valued item(s).
2. Try to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring no item is assigned more than once.
3. Adjust assignments to ensure all items are allocated.

Let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (68).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (72).
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (90).
- Agent 3 values item 4 the most (90), but since item 4 is already taken, we assign item 5 (42) to this agent.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most (89), but since item 3 is already taken, we assign item 5 (85) to this agent.

Now, check unallocated items:
- Item 1 is unallocated. Assign it to Agent 3 (15).
- Item 2 is unallocated. Assign it to Agent 4 (31).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and attempts to satisfy the agents by assigning higher-valued items to them wherever possible.
