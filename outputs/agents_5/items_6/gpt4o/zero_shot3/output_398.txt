Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  63  50  52  48  27
1  70  39  79  64  30  87
2  97  90  46  56   6  13
3  62  74  54  23  81  32
4  15   7  82  57  31  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets items that maximize their valuations while ensuring all items are allocated and each agent has an integer number of items.

Let's allocate the items based on maximizing the total valuation each agent receives:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the most: 52.
2. **Agent 1** values item 5 the most: 87.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most: 97.
4. **Agent 3** values item 4 the most: 81.
5. **Agent 4** values item 2 the most: 82.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and one item remains (item 1). Let's assign it to the agent who values it the most and has not been assigned any item yet.

Agent 2 values item 1 the most among remaining unassigned items: 90.

Here's the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it the most, and all items are allocated.
