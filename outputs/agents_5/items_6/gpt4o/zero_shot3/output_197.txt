Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 19.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  27  54  62  92  29
1  64  20  19  20  73  62
2  27  62  42  82  26  55
3  50  62  81  74  97  95
4  26  14  59  37  95  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[68 27 54 62 92 29]
 [64 20 19 20 73 62]
 [27 62 42 82 26 55]

 [26 14 59 37 95 80]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider the valuations provided and ensure that each agent gets at least one item while maximizing their total value. We will use a greedy approach to assign items to agents based on their highest valuation.

Hereâ€™s one possible allocation based on maximizing each agent's valuation:

1. Assign item 4 (value 92) to agent 0, as it is the highest value for this agent.
2. Assign item 5 (value 62) to agent 1, as it is the highest value for this agent.
3. Assign item 3 (value 82) to agent 2, as it is the highest value for this agent.
4. Assign item 2 (value 81) to agent 3, as it is the highest value for this agent.
5. Assign item 1 (value 14) to agent 4, as it is the only remaining item that agent 4 values.
6. Assign item 0 (value 68) to agent 0, as it is the next highest value for agent 0.

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and each agent receives at least one item.

The allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```
