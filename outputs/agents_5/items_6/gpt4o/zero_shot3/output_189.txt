Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  49  67   4  61  94  48
1  31  47  46  80  26  98
2  64  33  52  48  44  79
3  68  99  89  63  80  70
4  48  18  57  49  43  98

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

One approach is to start by assigning the highest-valued items to each agent, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. After each agent has one item, try to assign remaining items to maximize individual agents' total valuation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. Assign each agent their highest-valued item first:
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 94)
   - Agent 1: Item 5 (value 98)
   - Agent 2: Item 0 (value 64)
   - Agent 3: Item 1 (value 99)
   - Agent 4: Item 5 (value 98) (since it's already allocated to Agent 1, choose the next highest for a distinct allocation)

2. Assign remaining items to balance the distribution:
   - After step 1, the remaining items are 2, 3, and 5.
   - Assign the remaining items based on the next highest preference that doesn't disturb the initial allocation.

3. Final allocation:
   - Agent 0: Items [4]
   - Agent 1: Items [5]
   - Agent 2: Items [0]
   - Agent 3: Items [1, 3]
   - Agent 4: Items [2]

This ensures all items are allocated, each agent receives at least one item, and overall satisfaction is maximized.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
