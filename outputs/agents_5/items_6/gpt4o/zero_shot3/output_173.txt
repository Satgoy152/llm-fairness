Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  84  11  19  27  50
1  67  87  68  33  83  58
2  60  86  46  95  51   1
3  59  56  18  12  13  76
4  82  70  76  42  85  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[75 84 11 19 27 50]
 [67 87 68 33 83 58]
 [60 86 46 95 51  1]
 [59 56 18 12 13 76]
 [82 70 76 42 85 31]]
Output:
To allocate the items to the agents fairly, we need to consider the valuations and ensure each agent receives an integer number of items, with a total of 6 items allocated. A common approach in such scenarios is to use a method that maximizes the total valuation, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 1.
2. Agent 1 has high valuations for items 1 and 4, but since item 1 is already taken, item 4 is a good choice.
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 3.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5.
5. Agent 4 has high valuations for items 0 and 2. We can assign item 0 to Agent 4 since it's of higher value.

Considering these choices, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Items 0 and 2

Now, presenting the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
