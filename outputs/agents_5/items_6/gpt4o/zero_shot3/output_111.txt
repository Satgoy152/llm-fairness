Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  26  58  22  86  27
1  19  72  36  50  41  47
2   5  60  94  62  40  58
3  57  29  83  94  12  19
4  80  86  24  72  42  60

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We can do this by following these steps:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive each item.
2. Sort the items for each agent based on their valuations from highest to lowest.
3. Allocate items to agents by iterating over the sorted list and choosing the highest valued item available for each agent, ensuring no item is allocated more than once.
4. Ensure all items are allocated by the end of the process.

Here's one way to allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Highest value item is 4 (value 86)
- Agent 1: Highest value item is 1 (value 72)
- Agent 2: Highest value item is 2 (value 94)
- Agent 3: Highest value item is 3 (value 94)
- Agent 4: Highest value item is 0 (value 80)

Now, each agent has one item. Since there are 6 items, we have one item left to allocate, which is item 5. We can give this item to the agent who values it the most and hasn't already received a higher or equally valued item:

- Agent 4 values item 5 at 60, which is higher than any other agent's valuation for unallocated items.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed among the agents.
