Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  43  45  69  79  22
1  57  26  78  19  76  57
2   3  52  30  26  65  27
3  16  94  25  52  55  52
4  75  86  59  56  27  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the idea of maximizing the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One approach is to start by allocating items to agents who value them the most until all items are distributed. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0 (valuation: 79 - highest).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 3 (valuation: 94 - highest).
3. Assign item 5 to agent 1 (valuation: 57 - joint highest with agent 0, but agent 0 already has an item).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (valuation: 78 - highest).
5. Assign item 0 to agent 4 (valuation: 75 - highest).
6. Assign item 3 to agent 0 (valuation: 69 - highest remaining value for agent 0).

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated and that each agent has at least one item or none.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 3],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation is based on maximizing the individual agent valuations for the items, ensuring fairness and integer allocation for all items.
