Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  53  35  88  24  49
1  98  80  60   2  98  59
2  57  78  45  40  20   8
3  21  77  84  95  89  23
4  57  16  23  52  18   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total valuation each agent receives. One common approach is to use a variant of the Hungarian algorithm, which is designed for assignment problems and can be adapted for this scenario.

Let's begin by assigning the items to the agents based on their highest valuations, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

### Calculation Steps:

1. **Identify the highest valuations for each item across all agents.**
2. **Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.**
3. **Make sure all items are allocated.**

Let's go through this step-by-step:

- **Item 0**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (98).
- **Item 1**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (80).
- **Item 2**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (84).
- **Item 3**: Highest valuation is by Agent 3 (95).
- **Item 4**: Highest valuation is by Agent 1 (98).
- **Item 5**: Highest valuation is by Agent 0 (49).

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item, and adjust if necessary:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Items 0, 1, 4 (Agent 1 initially gets three items but has the highest valuations for these items)
- Agent 2: No items yet (we need to allocate at least one item to Agent 2)
- Agent 3: Items 2, 3
- Agent 4: No items yet (we need to allocate at least one item to Agent 4)

To ensure all agents have at least one item, let's adjust the allocations:

- Remove Item 1 from Agent 1 and allocate it to Agent 2, who has a relatively high valuation (78) for it.
- Remove Item 4 from Agent 1 and allocate it to Agent 4, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

### Final Allocation:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]
- Agent 4: [4]

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
