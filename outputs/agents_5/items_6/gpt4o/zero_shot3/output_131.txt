Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  97  87  49  45  73
1  54   8   0  19  91   1
2   1  80  54  32  71  89
3  81  29  66  68  59  90
4  26   3  45  34  24  72

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we should aim for an allocation that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Hereâ€™s one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values are for items 1 (97) and 2 (87).
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value is for item 4 (91).
3. **Agent 2**: The highest values are for items 5 (89) and 1 (80).
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value is for item 5 (90), but it's already taken, so we choose item 3 (68).
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value is for item 5 (72), but it's already taken, so we choose item 0 (26).

Based on the above analysis, a possible allocation could be:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 3
- Agent 4: Item 0

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an item and all items are distributed. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```
