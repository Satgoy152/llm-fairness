Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 5.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  15  13  12  33  68
1  95  69   5   4  60  61
2  10  48  15  60  98  22
3  89  47  47  95  32  42
4  70   9  25  98  53  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple approach by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. We'll ensure that each item is allocated and that the total number of items allocated is exactly 6.

Here's the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 1 with 95
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 with 15
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 3 with 47
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 3

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 4 with 98
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 2 with 98
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 2

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Highest value: Agent 0 with 68
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 0

Now, we summarize the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed fairly based on the highest valuation by each agent.
