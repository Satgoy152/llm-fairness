Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59   4   6  18  79  42
1  14  20  85  16  52  57
2  95  83   8  44  53  92
3  34  43  26  50  34  61
4  86  58  69  81  64  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an algorithm that considers the valuations of each agent for each item, aiming to maximize the overall satisfaction or value gained by each agent. One approach is to assign items to agents such that the total value for each agent is balanced.

Here are the valuations of the agents for the items:

```
Agent 0: [59, 4, 6, 18, 79, 42]
Agent 1: [14, 20, 85, 16, 52, 57]
Agent 2: [95, 83, 8, 44, 53, 92]
Agent 3: [34, 43, 26, 50, 34, 61]
Agent 4: [86, 58, 69, 81, 64, 71]
```

We'll attempt to allocate the items by considering each agent's highest-valued item that hasn't been already allocated, ensuring that each agent ends up with a fair share.

1. Agent 2 has the highest value of 95 for item 0, so assign item 0 to Agent 2.
2. Agent 1 has the highest value of 85 for item 2, so assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 4 has the next highest value of 81 for item 3, so assign item 3 to Agent 4.
4. Agent 0 has the next highest value of 79 for item 4, so assign item 4 to Agent 0.
5. Agent 2 has the next highest available value of 92 for item 5, so assign item 5 to Agent 2.
6. Agent 3 has the next highest available value of 50 for item 1, so assign item 1 to Agent 3.

This allocation attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their highest valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3]
}
```
