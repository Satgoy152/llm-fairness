Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  13  89  24  22  52  16
1  53  25  12   1  57  44
2  63  29  15  38  46  86
3  85  81  74  66  70  24
4  76  75   7   5  14  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to consider each agent's valuations and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and exactly six items are allocated in total.

Let's consider the highest valued items for each agent and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** values items 1 and 4 highly. We can assign item 1 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 4.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 5.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 0.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest value for item 0, but since it's already allocated, weâ€™ll look at the remaining items. They value item 3 next highest.

Now we need to ensure all items are allocated and each agent has at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 4 (Agent 1 also values item 4 highly)
- **Agent 2**: Item 5
- **Agent 3**: Item 0
- **Agent 4**: Item 3

Now, ensuring all items are allocated, the remaining item is 2. We can allocate this to the agent with the lowest allocation satisfaction, which is Agent 0 (since they have only one item with relatively lower valuations elsewhere).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an item, maximizes the agents' satisfaction based on their valuations, and ensures all items are allocated.
