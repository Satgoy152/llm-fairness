Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  59  33  85  46  43
1  22  78  83  87  36  43
2  70  70   5  80  28  48
3  83  21  60  13  38   2
4  90  50   6  38  98  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives a fair share of the items. Since there are 6 items and 5 agents, some agents will receive more items than others. To achieve a fair distribution, we can apply a method similar to a "maximum weight matching" in a bipartite graph, where agents are matched with items based on their valuations.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest valuation for agent 0 is item 0 with a value of 88. We assign item 0 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest valuation for agent 1 is item 3 with a value of 87. We assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest valuation for agent 2 is item 0 with a value of 70, but item 0 is already assigned. The next highest is item 3, which is also assigned. We assign item 5 to agent 2 with a value of 48.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest valuation for agent 3 is item 0 with a value of 83, but it is already assigned. The next highest is item 2 with a value of 60. We assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest valuation for agent 4 is item 4 with a value of 98. We assign item 4 to agent 4.

At this point, items 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are assigned. Item 1 is still unassigned.

6. **Remaining Items**:
   - Item 1: The highest remaining valuation is by agent 1 with a value of 78. We assign item 1 to agent 1.

Now, the allocation looks like this:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [3, 1]
- Agent 2: [5]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [4]

This allocation ensures each item is assigned, and we have tried to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
