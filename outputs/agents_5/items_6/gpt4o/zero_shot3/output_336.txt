Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  44  31  69  59  59  19
1  10  89  21  99  53   9
2  64   2  31   5  80  72
3  52  18  39  88  39  39
4  42  53  88  23  93  31

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[44 31 69 59 59 19]
 [10 89 21 99 53  9]
 [64  2 31  5 80 72]
 [52 18 39 88 39 39]
 [42 53 88 23 93 31]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider maximizing the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, as we have five agents and six items. Let's analyze the values and allocate accordingly:

1. **Agent 0** has highest valuations for items 2 (69) and 3 (59). We can assign item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** has the highest valuation for item 3 (99). We can assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest valuation for item 4 (80). We can assign item 4 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest valuation for item 3 (88), but it's already assigned. Their next highest valuation is item 0 (52). We can assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest valuation for item 4 (93), but it's already assigned. Their next highest valuation is item 2 (88), but it's assigned. Their next highest is item 1 (53). We can assign item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, one item remains unassigned, which is item 5. We will allocate it to the agent with the highest remaining valuation for that item, which is Agent 2 with a valuation of 72.

Final allocations:
- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: [4, 5]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [1]

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```
