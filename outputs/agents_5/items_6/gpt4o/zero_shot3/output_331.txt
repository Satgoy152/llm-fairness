Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 39.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  26  14  73  51   6   0
1  89  78  39  51  78  97
2  60  24  62  94  52  64
3  70  69  55  82  87  94
4  26  88  46  27  80  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign items to the agent who values them the most, while keeping track of the total number of items each agent receives to ensure fairness.

Let's go through the allocation process:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 89 by Agent 1.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 88 by Agent 4.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 73 by Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 94 by Agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 87 by Agent 3.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 97 by Agent 1.

After assigning items based on the highest valuations, let's see the allocations:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [0, 5]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [1]

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
