Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  65  50  40  48  44
1  56  85  94  97  16   8
2  84  63  36  33  67  33
3  30  92   0  84  87  75
4  22  10  17  28  46  47

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 5 65 50 40 48 44]
 [56 85 94 97 16  8]
 [84 63 36 33 67 33]
 [30 92  0 84 87 75]
 [22 10 17 28 46 47]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Here is a possible allocation that considers the values provided by the agents for the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 4: Valuation of 48
   - Item 5: Valuation of 44

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 3: Valuation of 97

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 0: Valuation of 84

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 1: Valuation of 92

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 2: Valuation of 17

This allocation ensures that each item is distributed and attempts to maximize the valuation for each agent.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
