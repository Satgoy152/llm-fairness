Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  88  53  55  79  79
1  49  42  93  70  19  22
2  51  37  53  63  69  51
3  16  35   8  25  62  75
4  75  59   7  56  80  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can aim to maximize the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. This can be done by evaluating the valuations and distributing items in a way that optimizes fairness and value.

Given the valuations, let's allocate items to the agents:

1. Agent 1 has a high valuation for item 2 (93). Let's allocate item 2 to agent 1.
2. Agent 0 has a high valuation for items 1 and 4 (88 and 79, respectively). Let's allocate items 1 and 4 to agent 0.
3. Agent 4 has a high valuation for item 0 (75). Let's allocate item 0 to agent 4.
4. Agent 3 has a high valuation for item 5 (75). Let's allocate item 5 to agent 3.
5. The remaining item, item 3, can go to agent 2, who has a reasonable valuation for it (63).

Here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and agents receive items based on their valuations as much as possible.
