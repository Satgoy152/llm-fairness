Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 85.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  99  71   1  93  67
1  74  54  85   6  98  98
2  36  31  43   6  67  53
3  72  75  61  49  96  67
4   2  97   5  74   7  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where items are allocated to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's evaluate the valuations and make allocations:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Highest value by Agent 1: 74
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest value by Agent 0: 99
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value by Agent 1: 85
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value by Agent 4: 74
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 4.

5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value by Agent 1: 98
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 1.

6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest value by Agent 1: 98
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 1.

Now, let's check the allocations:
- Agent 0 gets items: [1]
- Agent 1 gets items: [0, 2, 4, 5]
- Agent 2 gets items: []
- Agent 3 gets items: []
- Agent 4 gets items: [3]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and maximizes the total value each agent receives. Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0, 2, 4, 5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3]
}
```
