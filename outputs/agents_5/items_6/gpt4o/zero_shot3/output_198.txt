Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  54  61  57  42  52   6
1  27  81  55  53  80  38
2  54  49   3  56  89  10
3  90  76  85  36  41  45
4  98  95  51  88  17  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and exactly 6 items are distributed in total.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest value for Agent 0 is item 1 with a value of 61.
2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 1 with a value of 81, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 4 with a value of 80.
3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 4 with a value of 89, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 3 with a value of 56.
4. **Agent 3**: The highest value for Agent 3 is item 0 with a value of 90.
5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 0 with a value of 98, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 1 with a value of 95, but it is already taken. The next highest is item 5 with a value of 93.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we need to allocate 1 more item. Let's consider the items that were not yet allocated:

- Item 2: 
  - Agent 0: 57
  - Agent 1: 55
  - Agent 2: 3
  - Agent 3: 85
  - Agent 4: 51

Agent 3 has the highest value for item 2. We will assign item 2 to Agent 3.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [5]
}
```
