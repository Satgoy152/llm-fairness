Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 9.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  93  68  63   3  25   4
1   4  69   9  64  82  65
2  47  37  57  17  40  79
3  31  11   1  77  14  98
4  43  32  76   7  17  92

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring every item is allocated. Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. Assign items based on the highest valuation for each item.
2. Ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's proceed with this method:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 93.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the highest at 69.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the highest at 76.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the highest at 77.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the highest at 82.
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the highest at 98.

This allocation ensures that the highest valuation for each item is considered. Letâ€™s check the distribution to ensure fairness in terms of item numbers and adjust if needed:

- Agent 0: 1 item (0)
- Agent 1: 2 items (1, 4)
- Agent 2: 0 items
- Agent 3: 2 items (3, 5)
- Agent 4: 1 item (2)

This distribution assigns all items and provides each agent with a fair share based on their valuations. Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed while maximizing the total value each agent receives based on their preferences.
