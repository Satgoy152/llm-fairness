Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 55.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  32  53  54  18  22  71
1  59  24  55  25  90  68
2   3  13  39  56  14  16
3  63  23  22  93  72  19
4  84  53  81  53  59  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple allocation strategy that attempts to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive 2 items, and the others will receive 1.

Let's consider the highest valuations each agent has for the items and allocate accordingly:

1. Agent 0: Highest valuation for item 5 (71).
2. Agent 1: Highest valuation for item 4 (90).
3. Agent 2: Highest valuation for item 3 (56).
4. Agent 3: Highest valuation for item 3 (93) is already taken, so we choose item 0 (63).
5. Agent 4: Highest valuation for item 0 (84) is already taken, so we choose item 2 (81).

Now we have allocated each agent one item:

- Agent 0 has item 5.
- Agent 1 has item 4.
- Agent 2 has item 3.
- Agent 3 has item 0.
- Agent 4 has item 2.

One item remains: item 1. We can allocate it to the agent that will gain the most additional value:

- Agent 0 values item 1 as 53.
- Agent 1 values item 1 as 24.
- Agent 2 values item 1 as 13.
- Agent 3 values item 1 as 23.
- Agent 4 values item 1 as 53.

Agent 0 and Agent 4 both value item 1 as 53, which is the highest. Since Agent 4 has the highest value for it and already has the second-highest total valuation, let's allocate item 1 to Agent 0.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [5, 1]
- Agent 1: [4]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [2]

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
