Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  58  62  68  30  50
1  61  24  16   1   4  59
2  38  37  63  41   7  30
3  79  73  72  17  48  29
4  26  78  83  66  21  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use various fairness criteria such as maximizing the total valuation, ensuring each agent gets their most preferred item available, or distributing items so that the valuations are balanced across agents.

For this specific allocation, let's use a strategy that tries to maximize each agent's total valuation by assigning them the items they value most, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values the items highly, especially item 0 and item 3. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a relatively low valuation across the board but values item 5 the most. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 2. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 1 and item 3 highly. Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has the highest valuation for item 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

By following this allocation, each agent receives at least one item, and the items are distributed in a manner that seeks to maximize the total satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This ensures that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item. Note that Agent 4 receives two items to ensure all items are distributed.
