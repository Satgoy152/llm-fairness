Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  30  20  87  15  85
1  34  87  57  20  41   9
2  31  86  45  49  67  80
3  21  36  75  16  69  23
4  30  32  14  50  31  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[67 30 20 87 15 85]
 [34 87 57 20 41  9]
 [31 86 45 49 67 80]
 [21 36 75 16 69 23]
 [30 32 14 50 31 95]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and try to maximize the overall satisfaction while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item and each item is assigned to one agent. Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 87.
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the highest at 87.
3. Agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 80.
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 75.
5. Agent 4 values item 4 the highest at 31.

Now, each agent has one item, and we have one item left, which is item 0. We look at which agent would derive the most value from item 0:

- Agent 0 values item 0 at 67, which is the highest among all agents.

Allocating item 0 to Agent 0 maximizes the overall satisfaction for that item. Here's the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```
