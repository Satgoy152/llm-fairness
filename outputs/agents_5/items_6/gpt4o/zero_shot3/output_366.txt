Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  73  59  22  84  64
1  56  90  61  83  99  38
2  33  67  14  34  38  59
3  29  72  56  47  68  67
4  86  72  30  71  64  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, one approach is to employ a method that maximizes the total value of items assigned to each agent while ensuring that every item is allocated to one agent and each agent can receive one or more items. Given the valuations and the constraints, a possible allocation is as follows:

1. Find the highest value for each item among the agents, and assign the item to the agent that values it the most, ensuring that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (89).
- Agent 1 values item 4 the most (99).
- Agent 2 values item 5 the most (59).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (47).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the most (72).

The remaining item, item 2, can be allocated to agent 1, who has a high valuation for multiple items and can balance the load. Therefore, this allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4, 2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets a fair share based on their valuations, and all items are distributed among them.
