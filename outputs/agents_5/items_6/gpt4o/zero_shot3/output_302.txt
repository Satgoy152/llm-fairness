Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28   8   8  75  66  75
1  67  90  63  48   9  13
2  18  11  23  51  46  21
3  22   2  48  77   9  32
4  81  83  74   2  62   2

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [67 90 63 48  9 13]

 [81 83 74  2 62  2]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will consider the valuations of each item by each agent and try to assign items to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. We shall aim to distribute the items such that each agent's total valuation is as balanced as possible while also ensuring that each agent gets at least an integer number of items.

Based on the valuations provided, here is one possible fair allocation:

- Assign item 0 to agent 4 (valuation 81).
- Assign item 1 to agent 1 (valuation 90).
- Assign item 2 to agent 4 (valuation 74).
- Assign item 3 to agent 3 (valuation 77).
- Assign item 4 to agent 0 (valuation 66).
- Assign item 5 to agent 0 (valuation 75).

This ensures that each item is allocated exactly once and that agents with higher valuations for certain items receive them, thereby maximizing overall satisfaction.

Here are the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
