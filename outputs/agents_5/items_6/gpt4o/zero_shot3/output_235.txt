Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  96  90  89  37   3  32
1  31  76  66  86  39  30
2  39  50   0  23   4  17
3  83  64  86  90  24  90
4  23  91  44  93  63  17

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[96 90 89 37  3 32]
 [31 76 66 86 39 30]
 [39 50  0 23  4 17]
 [83 64 86 90 24 90]
 [23 91 44 93 63 17]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to distribute them in such a way that considers the values each agent assigns to the items, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item and all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

```
Agent 0: Items and their values: [96, 90, 89, 37, 3, 32]
Agent 1: Items and their values: [31, 76, 66, 86, 39, 30]
Agent 2: Items and their values: [39, 50, 0, 23, 4, 17]
Agent 3: Items and their values: [83, 64, 86, 90, 24, 90]
Agent 4: Items and their values: [23, 91, 44, 93, 63, 17]
```

Now, let's decide the allocation by maximizing the overall happiness:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (96).
- Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (91).
- Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (86).
- Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (90).
- Agent 3 values item 2 the second highest (86, after item 3).
- Agent 2 has low values overall, but the next available item with some value is 4 (4).

Ensuring each agent gets at least one item, we can proceed with the allocations:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (who values it second highest after item 5).
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 (though the value is low, it ensures all items are allocated).

Final allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
