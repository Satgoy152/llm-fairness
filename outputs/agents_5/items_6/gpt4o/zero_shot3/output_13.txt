Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  33  48  54  79  62  86
1   9  51  72  41   9  41
2  32  58  16  13  94  83
3  39  56  48  64  81  11
4  75  11  68  17  88  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. We can approach this by assigning items in a way that tries to equalize the value across agents as much as possible.

Here's a suggested allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Item 5 (value 86) and Item 3 (value 79) are highly valued by Agent 0. Assign these items to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 2 (value 72) has the highest value for Agent 1. Assign this item to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 4 (value 94) is the most valuable item for Agent 2. Assign this item to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 1 (value 56) is the highest value Agent 3 has for any item. Assign this item to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 0 (value 75) is the most valuable item for Agent 4. Assign this item to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives their most preferred items as much as possible while distributing items evenly. Let's present the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation considers each agent's highest-valued items and distributes the items to ensure fairness in terms of total value received.
