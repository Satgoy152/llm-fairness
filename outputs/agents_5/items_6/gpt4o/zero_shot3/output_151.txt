Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  46  68  79  22  80
1  26  37  15  84  48  36
2  26  91  17  34  34  11
3  60   3  93  65  96  98
4  44  32  72  17  68   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that tries to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common method is to use a greedy approach where we allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. However, since we need to distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items and we have exactly 6 items, we must ensure that all items are allocated while considering fairness.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Identify the highest valued item for each agent and allocate it to them, if possible.
2. If any items remain unallocated, assign them to agents who have the fewest items or who would gain the most value from them.

Let's apply this approach to the table:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most at 80.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most at 84.
- Agent 2 values item 1 the most at 91.
- Agent 3 values item 5 the most at 98, but it is already allocated to Agent 0, so we consider the next highest, item 4, at 96.
- Agent 4 values item 4 the most at 68, but it is already allocated to Agent 3, so we consider the next highest, item 2, at 72.

Now, let's ensure each agent has at least one item and all 6 items are allocated:

1. Allocate item 0 to Agent 0.
2. Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
3. Allocate item 2 to Agent 4.
4. Allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
5. Allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
6. Allocate item 5 to Agent 0.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item.
