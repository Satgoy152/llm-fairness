Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 48.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75   7  34  66  25  53
1  12  12  48  20   1  13
2  95  59  35  36  66  76
3  84  56   6  59  32  89
4  78  73  66  38  43  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on the valuations provided, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction or value each agent receives given the constraint that each agent can receive one or more items and each item must be allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

- Agent 0: [75, 7, 34, 66, 25, 53]
- Agent 1: [12, 12, 48, 20, 1, 13]
- Agent 2: [95, 59, 35, 36, 66, 76]
- Agent 3: [84, 56, 6, 59, 32, 89]
- Agent 4: [78, 73, 66, 38, 43, 20]

A possible fair allocation strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Let's proceed with this approach:

1. Item 0 (valuations: [75, 12, 95, 84, 78]) - Assign to Agent 2 (value: 95)
2. Item 1 (valuations: [7, 12, 59, 56, 73]) - Assign to Agent 4 (value: 73)
3. Item 2 (valuations: [34, 48, 35, 6, 66]) - Assign to Agent 1 (value: 48)
4. Item 3 (valuations: [66, 20, 36, 59, 38]) - Assign to Agent 0 (value: 66)
5. Item 4 (valuations: [25, 1, 66, 32, 43]) - Assign to Agent 2 (value: 66)
6. Item 5 (valuations: [53, 13, 76, 89, 20]) - Assign to Agent 3 (value: 89)

Each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here is the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
