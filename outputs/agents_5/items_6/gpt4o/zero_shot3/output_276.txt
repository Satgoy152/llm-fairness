Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   8  60   1  37  94  40
1  48   6  27  43  19  53
2  47  91  66  25  46  94
3   2  17  75  52  27  92
4  40  38  42  26  27  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item (since there are 5 agents and 6 items). One simple heuristic is to assign the highest valued items to the agents who value them the most, as long as it doesnâ€™t conflict with other high-value allocations.

Here's a potential allocation strategy based on the given valuations:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 0, as they value it at 94, which is the highest value for any item.
2. Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they value it at 91, which is the highest for agent 2.
3. Assign item 5 to agent 3, as they value it at 92, which is the highest for agent 3.
4. Assign item 3 to agent 1, as they value it at 43, which is the highest among the remaining unmatched items for agent 1.
5. Assign item 2 to agent 4, as they value it at 42, which is the highest among the remaining unmatched items for agent 4.
6. Finally, assign item 0 to agent 1, as they value it at 48.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here's the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```
