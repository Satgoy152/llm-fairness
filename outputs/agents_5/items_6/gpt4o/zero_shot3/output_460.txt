Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  51  83  44  63  81
1   4  85  16  99  49  83
2  71  78  67  97  61  36
3  61  54  77  21  92  89
4  49  25  31  39   6  79

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while maximizing their valuations, we can use a greedy approach, considering the highest valuations first. Here's a step-by-step allocation process based on the given table:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 very highly.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the highest.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 highly, but it's already allocated to Agent 1. Instead, consider item 1.
4. Agent 3 values item 4 the highest.
5. Agent 4 values item 5 the highest.

Let's allocate based on these observations. We'll ensure no item is assigned to more than one agent, and each agent can receive at least one item.

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 3.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 4.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.

Now, one item remains unallocated: item 2. Looking for the highest valuation among agents who haven't yet received their highest preference:
- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (83).

Let's finalize the allocation with this distribution:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items and all 6 items are allocated.
