Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  64  23  64  85  11   3
1   1  55  37  79  49  30
2  56  78  31  30  26  12
3  87   6  28  11  15  20
4  82  90  11  94  87  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the total value for each agent. A popular method for such allocation problems is the "Greedy Algorithm," where we allocate items to agents based on their highest valuations first, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's allocate the items:

1. **Agents' Valuations for Items:**

   ```
   Agent 0: [64, 23, 64, 85, 11, 3]
   Agent 1: [1, 55, 37, 79, 49, 30]
   Agent 2: [56, 78, 31, 30, 26, 12]
   Agent 3: [87, 6, 28, 11, 15, 20]
   Agent 4: [82, 90, 11, 94, 87, 41]
   ```

2. **Allocate items to maximize each agent's value:**

   - First, assign the highest valued items to the respective agents:
     - Item 3 is valued highest by Agent 4 (94).
     - Item 0 is valued highest by Agent 3 (87).
     - Item 1 is valued highest by Agent 4 (90).
     - Item 4 is valued highest by Agent 4 (87).
     - Item 2 is valued highest by Agent 0 (64).
     - Item 5 is valued highest by Agent 1 (30).

3. **Resulting Allocation:**

   - Agent 0 gets item 2
   - Agent 1 gets item 5
   - Agent 2 gets no items
   - Agent 3 gets item 0
   - Agent 4 gets items 1, 3, and 4

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1, 3, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures a fair distribution of items while maximizing the value obtained by the agents.
