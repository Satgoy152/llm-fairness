Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  60  96  85  32  70
1  26  56  23  23  92  26
2  89  26  69  41  65  84
3  94  21  40  15  70  31
4  15   1  89   8  21  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent gets according to their valuations. Let's use a simple greedy strategy to distribute the items:

1. Sort each item by its highest valuation among all agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Hereâ€™s how this strategy can be applied:

1. Item 0: Highest value is 94 by Agent 3.
2. Item 1: Highest value is 60 by Agent 0.
3. Item 2: Highest value is 96 by Agent 0.
4. Item 3: Highest value is 85 by Agent 0.
5. Item 4: Highest value is 92 by Agent 1.
6. Item 5: Highest value is 84 by Agent 2.

However, to ensure that each agent gets a fair share, we may need to adjust the allocation by considering alternative allocations for some items. Let's attempt a fair distribution:

- Agent 0: Items 1, 2
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 5
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Item 3

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are fairly distributed based on the maximum valuation principle.
