Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 66.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  94  50  14  25   1
1  25  90  66  67  88  15
2  66  23  23  49  20  61
3  26   5  74   3  61  19
4  36   5   0  45  74  12

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can try to maximize the total value each agent receives by considering their valuations. One method to achieve this is to perform a greedy allocation based on the highest value each agent places on the available items. Let's go through this process step by step:

1. **Item 0:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 83.
   - Agent 2 values it at 66.
   - Agent 4 values it at 36.
   - Highest value: Agent 0.

2. **Item 1:**
   - Agent 0 values it at 94.
   - Agent 1 values it at 90.
   - Highest value: Agent 0.

3. **Item 2:**
   - Agent 3 values it at 74.
   - Agent 1 values it at 66.
   - Highest value: Agent 3.

4. **Item 3:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 67.
   - Agent 2 values it at 49.
   - Highest value: Agent 1.

5. **Item 4:**
   - Agent 1 values it at 88.
   - Agent 4 values it at 74.
   - Highest value: Agent 1.

6. **Item 5:**
   - Agent 2 values it at 61.
   - Agent 0 values it at 1.
   - Highest value: Agent 2.

Now, let's format the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives a fair distribution based on their preferences, and all items are allocated.
