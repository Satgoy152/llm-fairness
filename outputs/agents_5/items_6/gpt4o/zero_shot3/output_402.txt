Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  95  20  14  39  19  67
1  44  24  15  10  32  69
2  61  60  27  76  77  23
3  33  28  37  52  73  40
4  86   1  87  64  56   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and attempt to maximize the total satisfaction or value derived by all agents. One common approach is to use a method similar to the "maximum sum of valuations" or "maximum weighted matching." Here, we will allocate items such that each agent gets at least one item wherever possible, and maximize the total value across agents.

Let's look at the process step-by-step:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**: Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Make sure that all items are allocated, keeping track of how many items each agent receives.

3. **Consider fairness**: If any agent ends up with zero items, attempt to reallocate to ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Let's implement this with the given data:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the highest at 95.
- Item 1: Agent 2 values it the highest at 60.
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the highest at 87.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the highest at 76.
- Item 4: Agent 3 values it the highest at 73.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the highest at 69.

Now we allocate these items and check if any agent has no items:

- Agent 0: [0]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [1, 3]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [2]

Each agent gets at least one item. The allocation is fair and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```
