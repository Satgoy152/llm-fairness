Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 0.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  79  80  60  74  26  34
1  86  14   0  62  48  89
2  46  82  38  30  14  95
3  89  10  64  78  20  61
4  92  78  72  75  33  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the overall satisfaction based on the valuations given. We need to allocate exactly 6 items, one for each column. Let's consider the highest value each agent places on the items and ensure that each agent receives at least one item, if possible. Here's one approach:

1. Identify the highest valued items for each agent.
2. Allocate items based on maximizing value per agent.
3. Ensure each agent gets a fair distribution of the total value.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

- Agent 0 highly values items 0 (79) and 1 (80).
- Agent 1 places a high value on item 5 (89).
- Agent 2 places the highest value on item 5 (95).
- Agent 3 places a high value on item 0 (89) and item 3 (78).
- Agent 4 places the highest value on item 0 (92).

Considering these values, here's a potential allocation:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 0 to Agent 4.

Now, let's see the remaining items (2 and 4) to allocate:

- Agent 0 could take item 2 since they value it at 60.
- Agent 1 could take item 4 since they value it at 48.

The allocation could be:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent gets at least one item with the consideration of their valuations.
