Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59  60  95   1  21  22
1  58  33  28  57  52  61
2  30  86  83  68  48   4
3  11  75  87  83  93  54
4  63  34  87  25  72  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated. One approach is to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring all items are distributed.

Let's consider the valuations to make a reasonable allocation:

1. Start by identifying the highest-value items for each agent and attempt to allocate them based on maximizing their utility.

2. Check for conflicts where multiple agents highly value the same item, and resolve them by considering the next best alternatives.

Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

- Agent 0 highly values item 2 (95) and item 1 (60).
- Agent 1 highly values item 5 (61).
- Agent 2 highly values item 1 (86) and item 2 (83).
- Agent 3 highly values item 4 (93).
- Agent 4 highly values item 0 (63) and item 2 (87).

Considering these valuations, we can allocate the items as follows:

- Assign item 2 to agent 0 to maximize their utility for that item.
- Assign item 5 to agent 1, as they have the highest valuation for it among the agents.
- Assign item 1 to agent 2, as they have a high valuation for it, and agent 0 already got item 2, their next best.
- Assign item 4 to agent 3, as they have the highest valuation for it among the agents.
- Assign item 0 to agent 4, as they have a high valuation for it, and item 2 is taken.

Now, we need to assign item 3, which is left:

- Assign item 3 to agent 1, as they have a reasonable valuation for it, and only one item is allocated to agent 1 so far.

The final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned, and it respects the integer allocation constraint.
