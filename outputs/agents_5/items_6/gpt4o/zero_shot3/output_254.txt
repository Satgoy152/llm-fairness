Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  25   0  35  21  86   3
1  54  21  11  42  35  46
2  35  52   9   7  16  10
3  14  98  87  57  31  54
4  30  65  36  22  95  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach by considering each agent's highest valued items and ensuring each agent ends up with at least one item. We will also ensure that each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

Let's go through the process:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest value is item 4 (value 86).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest value is item 0 (value 54).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest value is item 1 (value 52).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest value is item 1 (value 98), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 2 (value 87).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest value is item 4 (value 95), but it's already taken. Next highest is item 5 (value 62).

After determining the primary allocations, we have:

- Agent 0 gets item 4.
- Agent 1 gets item 0.
- Agent 2 gets item 1.
- Agent 3 gets item 2.
- Agent 4 gets item 5.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. We need to allocate the remaining item (item 3). We'll give this to the agent who values it the most and hasn't yet reached their highest value:

- Agent 1 has item 3 as the next highest valued item (value 42).

Final allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0, 3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all six items are allocated.
