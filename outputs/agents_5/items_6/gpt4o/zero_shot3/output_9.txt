Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 26.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  28  52  88  10  81  28
1  41   2  26  87  50   9
2  44  82  34  20  33  82
3  36  26  49  41  52  97
4  87  25  38  19  78   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[28 52 88 10 81 28]
 [41  2 26 87 50  9]
 [44 82 34 20 33 82]
 [36 26 49 41 52 97]
 [87 25 38 19 78  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the overall satisfaction by considering the highest valuations for each item. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Looking at the valuations, Agent 0 values item 2 the highest (88), so we can allocate item 2 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 3 the highest (87), so we allocate item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values items 1 and 5 the highest (both 82), so we allocate item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 5 the highest (97), so we allocate item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (87), so we allocate item 0 to Agent 4.
6. For item 4, Agent 0 has the highest valuation (81) after the previous allocations, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 0.

With this allocation, each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most among the remaining unallocated items.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```
