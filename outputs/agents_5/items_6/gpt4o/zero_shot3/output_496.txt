Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  90  27  10  98  95
1   0  69  79  85  58  44
2  65  48  45   3  44  27
3  71  48  30   0  91  65
4  71   9  50  89  63  52

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction (or valuation) of the agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and that exactly 6 items are allocated in total. Here's one way to approach this:

1. **Analyze the valuations**: Look at the table to understand the valuation each agent has for each item. We try to allocate items to agents who value them the most.

2. **Start with the highest valuations**: Allocate items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item. This ensures that items go to agents who value them highly.

3. **Ensure distribution**: Make sure that the allocations are spread out among the agents as fairly as possible.

Let's analyze the table:

- **Item 0**: Highest value (71) by Agent 3.
- **Item 1**: Highest value (90) by Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: Highest value (79) by Agent 1.
- **Item 3**: Highest value (89) by Agent 4.
- **Item 4**: Highest value (98) by Agent 0.
- **Item 5**: Highest value (95) by Agent 0.

Following this allocation method, Agent 0 would get multiple items initially, but this needs to be balanced to ensure fairness among agents. Let's adjust so that each agent gets at least one item, wherever possible, and exactly one agent will get two items due to the total number of items (6).

### Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [1, 4] (Items 1 and 4 have the highest valuations for Agent 0).
- **Agent 1**: [2] (Item 2 has a high valuation for Agent 1).
- **Agent 2**: [] (No items allocated due to lower valuations relative to others).
- **Agent 3**: [0] (Item 0 has a high valuation for Agent 3).
- **Agent 4**: [3, 5] (Items 3 and 5 have considerable valuations for Agent 4).

### JSON Format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to an agent who values it, and all items are distributed while keeping the allocations as fair as possible.
