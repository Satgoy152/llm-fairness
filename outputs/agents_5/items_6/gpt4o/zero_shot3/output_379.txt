Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 57.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  77  94  44  10  73
1  29  36  57  97   2  26
2   4   7   8  65  21  49
3  65  94  36  93  69  40
4  88  55  78  52  93  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total value assigned to each agent while ensuring every item is allocated. A simple approach is to allocate each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation can be done:

1. Item 0:
   - Agent valuations: [27, 29, 4, 65, 88]
   - Highest value: 88 by Agent 4

2. Item 1:
   - Agent valuations: [77, 36, 7, 94, 55]
   - Highest value: 94 by Agent 3

3. Item 2:
   - Agent valuations: [94, 57, 8, 36, 78]
   - Highest value: 94 by Agent 0

4. Item 3:
   - Agent valuations: [44, 97, 65, 93, 52]
   - Highest value: 97 by Agent 1

5. Item 4:
   - Agent valuations: [10, 2, 21, 69, 93]
   - Highest value: 93 by Agent 4

6. Item 5:
   - Agent valuations: [73, 26, 49, 40, 29]
   - Highest value: 73 by Agent 0

Now, let's distribute the items according to these allocations:

- Agent 0: [2, 5]
- Agent 1: [3]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [1]
- Agent 4: [0, 4]

Thus, the final allocation in the required JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 4]
}
```
