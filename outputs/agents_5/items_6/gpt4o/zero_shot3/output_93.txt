Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 93.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  46   8  33  34  94  74
1  61  23  93  71  11  11
2  26  30   0  34  34  34
3  29   7  47  83  98  57
4  48  96   3   9  45  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [26 30  0 34 34 34]

 [48 96  3  9 45 76]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and that the total number of items allocated equals the total number of items available. Given there are 6 items, it is possible for some agents to receive more items than others, but the allocation must be done in a way that considers the values agents assign to the items.

Here is one possible allocation based on maximizing the total value for each agent:

1. Assign item 4 to agent 3 (value 98).
2. Assign item 1 to agent 4 (value 96).
3. Assign item 0 to agent 1 (value 61).
4. Assign item 2 to agent 1 (value 93).
5. Assign item 3 to agent 3 (value 83).
6. Assign item 5 to agent 0 (value 74).

Thus, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0, 2],
    "2": [],
    "3": [4, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.
