Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  38  67  82  62  99
1  75  91  94  30   1  51
2  15   7  74  69  60   3
3   4  61  73  70  16  96
4  14  75   1   0  68  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can employ a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation of the items assigned to each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will end up with two items. 

Here is one possible allocation:

- **Agent 0** has high values for items 3 and 5. Let's assign item 5 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value (99).
- **Agent 1** has a high valuation for items 1 and 2. Let's assign item 2 to Agent 1 with a value of 94.
- **Agent 2** has a particularly high valuation for item 2, but since it’s already taken, assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- **Agent 3** values item 5 highly, but since it’s taken, assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- **Agent 4** has a high valuation for item 4, assign item 4 to Agent 4.
- Now, every agent has one item, but we have one item left, item 0. It can be assigned to Agent 1, as it gives a decent value (75).

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2, 0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, with one agent receiving two items, and all 6 items are allocated.
