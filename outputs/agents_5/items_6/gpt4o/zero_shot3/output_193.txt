Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  71   0  37  54  20  73
1  86  42  11  62  53  79
2  90  35  87  28  61  63
3  69  73  92  44  48  77
4  61   2  90  57  57  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider both the agents' valuations and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items with a total of 6 items allocated. One common approach is to aim for Pareto efficiency, where no agent can be made better off without making another agent worse off.

Here's one possible allocation based on the given valuations:

1. Agent 0 has high values for items 0 and 5.
2. Agent 1 has high values for items 0 and 5, but item 5 is slightly higher for Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has high values for items 0 and 2.
4. Agent 3 has high values for items 2 and 5, but item 2 is the highest for Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has high values for items 2 and 3.

Given these observations, we can make the following allocations:

- Agent 0: Item 3
- Agent 1: Item 5
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 2
- Agent 4: Item 4

Agent 4 is also assigned item 1, as it provides the least value across all agents, and Agent 4 has the least total value otherwise.

Thus, the allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.
