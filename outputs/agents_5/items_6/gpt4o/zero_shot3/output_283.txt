Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 38.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  14  18  64  93  16   2
1  81   4  38  81  36  27
2  56  67   5  50   4  14
3  93  37  66  30  48  28
4  36  96  14  88   7  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider a fair division method that aims to distribute the items in a way that maximizes the total satisfaction of all agents, based on their valuations.

One approach is to use the idea of maximizing each agent's total valuation for the items they receive while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Calculate the total valuation for each agent if they were to receive all the items.
2. Allocate items to agents while trying to maximize each agent's satisfaction.

Let's calculate the total valuations and then allocate the items:

- Agent 0: [14, 18, 64, 93, 16, 2] = Total Valuation: 207
- Agent 1: [81, 4, 38, 81, 36, 27] = Total Valuation: 267
- Agent 2: [56, 67, 5, 50, 4, 14] = Total Valuation: 196
- Agent 3: [93, 37, 66, 30, 48, 28] = Total Valuation: 302
- Agent 4: [36, 96, 14, 88, 7, 86] = Total Valuation: 327

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 4 has the highest total valuation and gets item 1 (value 96) and item 3 (value 88).
- Agent 3 gets item 0 (value 93) and item 2 (value 66).
- Agent 1 gets item 4 (value 36).
- Agent 0 gets item 5 (value 2).

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and tries to maximize the satisfaction of agents based on their preferences.

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0, 2],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated.
