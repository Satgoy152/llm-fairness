Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  35  61  77  41  25
1  20  91  16  25  87  22
2  99  34  15  97  36  98
3  12  46  96  44  31  45
4   5  23   3  84  81  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. We'll attempt to give each agent the items they value the most, ensuring that all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here is a possible allocation that attempts to balance the allocations fairly:

1. **Agent 0**: They have the highest value for item 3, which is 77.
2. **Agent 1**: They have the highest value for item 1, which is 91.
3. **Agent 2**: They have the highest value for item 0, which is 99.
4. **Agent 3**: They have the highest value for item 2, which is 96.
5. **Agent 4**: They have the highest value for item 4, which is 81.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining item:

6. **Agent 2**: They also have a high value for item 5, which is 98.

Thus, the allocation can be as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, all items are allocated, and the allocation is relatively fair based on the agents' valuations.
