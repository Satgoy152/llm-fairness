Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  13  59  19  91  19
1  26  25  12  39   1  41
2  53  38  10   4  45  45
3  47  25  73  52  38  77
4  45   2  99  64   1  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents based on their valuations, we can use an approach that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item, if possible. 

Here's one potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (91), so we allocate item 4 to them.
2. **Agent 1**: Agent 1 values item 5 the highest (41), so we allocate item 5 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (53), so we allocate item 0 to them.
4. **Agent 3**: Agent 3 values item 5 (77), but item 5 is already allocated. The next highest is item 2 (73), so we allocate item 2 to them.
5. **Agent 4**: Agent 4 values item 2 (99), but item 2 is already allocated. The next highest is item 3 (64), so we allocate item 3 to them.

At this point, items 0, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are allocated. Only item 1 is left:

6. **Remaining Item 1**: 
   - Agent 0 values item 1 as 13.
   - Agent 1 values item 1 as 25.
   - Agent 2 values item 1 as 38.
   - Agent 3 values item 1 as 25.
   - Agent 4 values item 1 as 2.

Since Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 that is still unallocated, item 1 is allocated to Agent 2.

Now, let's format this allocation into the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0, 1],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent, except for Agent 1, gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Note that some agents receive more than one item, which is acceptable as long as the total number of allocated items is correct.
