Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15   5  98   2  79  66
1  31  60  15  51  26  27
2  22  19  76  55  23  59
3  47  30  51  53  58  97
4  67  92  23  81  98  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's examine the valuations and work towards an optimal allocation:

1. Assign the highest valued items to each agent as much as possible while ensuring each agent receives at least one item.
2. Allocate remaining items by considering the highest valuation left for agents who have fewer items.

Here are the individual allocations based on the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 98, which is the highest value item among all agents. Assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 4 values item 4 at 98, which is the highest for Agent 4. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.
- Agent 3 values item 5 at 97, the highest for Agent 3. Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
- Agent 1 values item 1 at 60, which is the highest for Agent 1. Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 4 values item 3 at 81. Assign item 3 to Agent 4 as well.
- Agent 2 values item 0 at 22, which is the best remaining option for Agent 2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2.

Now, all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Item 2
- Agent 1: Item 1
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Items 3 and 4

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
