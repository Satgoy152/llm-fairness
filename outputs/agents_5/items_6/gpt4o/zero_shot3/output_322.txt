Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  63   4  68  60  92  31
1  23   5  10  51  64  86
2   4  76  23  11   0  67
3  93  36   9  60   4  49
4  83  60  26  70   1   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can try to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. A common method for such allocation is to use a greedy approach, where we assign the highest-valued item that hasn't been assigned yet to the agent who values it the most, until all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation based on the provided valuations:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 3 values it the most (93). Allocate to Agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 2 values it the most (76). Allocate to Agent 2.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 0 values it the most (68). Allocate to Agent 0.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 4 values it the most (70). Allocate to Agent 4.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most (92). Allocate to Agent 0.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 1 values it the most (86). Allocate to Agent 1.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all six items are distributed fairly among the five agents based on their highest valuations.
