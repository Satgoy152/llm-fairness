Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 62.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  83  37  39  60  77  57
1  51  97  62  19  38  21
2  55  45  52  11  80  46
3  77  85  12  80  18  93
4  14  49  14  38  14  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we can use a heuristic approach that tries to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive two items. We'll aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation is maximized and each agent gets a fair share according to their preferences.

Here's a possible allocation approach:

1. Calculate the highest value each agent has for any item and allocate that item to the agent.
2. Once each agent has at least one item, allocate the remaining item to the agent who values it the most among those who only have one item.

Let's implement this:

1. Agent 0 values item 0 the most (83).
2. Agent 1 values item 1 the most (97).
3. Agent 2 values item 4 the most (80).
4. Agent 3 values item 5 the most (93).
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most, but it is already taken by Agent 1. Their next highest is item 5, but that's taken by Agent 3. So, the next is item 2 (14).

Now that each agent has one item, we need to allocate the remaining items:

- Items 3 and 4 are still available.
- Agent 0's next highest available is item 3 (60).
- Agent 1's next highest available is item 2 (62).
- Agent 2's next highest available is item 0 (55).
- Agent 3's next highest available is item 3 (80).
- Agent 4's next highest available is item 3 (38).

Since item 3 is valued highly by Agent 3, allocate item 3 to Agent 3. Now, assign the last unallocated item:

- Item 4 remains. Agent 0 values it highest among those who have only one item (77).

Considering these steps, hereâ€™s a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [],
    "3": [5, 3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation assigns each agent at least one item, maximizing their individual valuations as closely as possible to what they value most.
