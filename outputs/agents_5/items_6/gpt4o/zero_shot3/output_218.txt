Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  40   5  87  40  60
1  94  56  56   2  64  14
2  79  59  80   0  38  39
3  39  73  64  29  46  42
4  23  59  51  90  19  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic based on the valuations given in the table. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all six items are allocated. We will aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring fairness in the allocation process.

Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Has a high valuation for item 3. Allocating item 3 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a high valuation for items 0 and 2. Allocating item 0 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has a high valuation for item 2. Allocating item 2 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a high valuation for item 1. Allocating item 1 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has a high valuation for items 4 and 5. Allocating items 4 and 5 to Agent 4.

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
