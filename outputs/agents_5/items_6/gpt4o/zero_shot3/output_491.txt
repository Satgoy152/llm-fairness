Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 65.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  97  35  14  91  18  95
1  17  23  65  29   9   4
2  47  60  70  65  84  88
3   1  32   2  16  21  91
4  42  81  44  71  19  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the valuations of the agents are considered, and each agent gets an integer number of items. We should also ensure that each agent is included in the allocation, even if they receive no items.

Here is a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 3, and 5, so we can allocate items 0 and 3 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 2, so we will allocate item 2 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 2 has high valuations across several items, but the highest for item 5 among the remaining items, so we allocate item 5 to Agent 2.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5, but since it's already taken, we will evaluate remaining items. Item 4 has a moderate valuation for Agent 3, so we allocate item 4 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 1, so we will allocate item 1 to Agent 4.

Now, we verify that all items are allocated and each agent is included:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 are all allocated.
- Each agent from 0 to 4 is included in the allocation.

Here are the final allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
