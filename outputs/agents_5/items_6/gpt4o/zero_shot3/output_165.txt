Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 46.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7   2  86  11   1  73
1  87  33  46  20  36  41
2  31  92  68  51  26  46
3  61  22  29  95  99   5
4  96  56  55   2  34  14

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 7  2 86 11  1 73]
 [87 33 46 20 36 41]
 [31 92 68 51 26 46]
 [61 22 29 95 99  5]
 [96 56 55  2 34 14]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation for each agent. One approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Let's go through the items one by one:

- **Item 0**: The valuations for item 0 are [7, 87, 31, 61, 96]. Agent 4 values it the most with 96.
- **Item 1**: The valuations for item 1 are [2, 33, 92, 22, 56]. Agent 2 values it the most with 92.
- **Item 2**: The valuations for item 2 are [86, 46, 68, 29, 55]. Agent 0 values it the most with 86.
- **Item 3**: The valuations for item 3 are [11, 20, 51, 95, 2]. Agent 3 values it the most with 95.
- **Item 4**: The valuations for item 4 are [1, 36, 26, 99, 34]. Agent 3 values it the most with 99.
- **Item 5**: The valuations for item 5 are [73, 41, 46, 5, 14]. Agent 0 values it the most with 73.

Now, we can assign the items to the agents based on these valuations:

- Agent 0: Items 2 and 5
- Agent 1: No items (since no item is valued highest by agent 1)
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Items 3 and 4
- Agent 4: Item 0

The allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3, 4],
    "4": [0]
}
```
