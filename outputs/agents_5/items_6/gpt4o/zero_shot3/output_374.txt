Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  58  58  76  11  97  73
1  64  63  23  22  72  75
2  90  32  14  65  41   1
3  53  31  69  65  45   6
4  42  21  31   8  39  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[58 58 76 11 97 73]
 [64 63 23 22 72 75]
 [90 32 14 65 41  1]
 [53 31 69 65 45  6]
 [42 21 31  8 39 71]]
Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we can use an algorithm that maximizes the total value each agent receives while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. We need to ensure that all 6 items are allocated.

Let's examine the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [58, 58, 76, 11, 97, 73]
Agent 1: [64, 63, 23, 22, 72, 75]
Agent 2: [90, 32, 14, 65, 41, 1]
Agent 3: [53, 31, 69, 65, 45, 6]
Agent 4: [42, 21, 31, 8, 39, 71]
```

Here is a possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0:** Item 4 (value 97)
2. **Agent 1:** Item 5 (value 75)
3. **Agent 2:** Item 0 (value 90)
4. **Agent 3:** Item 3 (value 65)
5. **Agent 4:** Item 2 (value 31)
6. **Agent 0:** Item 1 (value 58)

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. The total value for each agent is reasonably balanced given their preferences.

Now, let's present the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```
