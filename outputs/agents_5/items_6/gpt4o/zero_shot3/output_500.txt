Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 36.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  47  82  99  49  48  90
1  68  97  36  24  41  35
2  43  91  76  78  28  41
3  22  43  87  72  47  93
4  25  50  72  43   9   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that each agent gets a fair share of the total value of the items. While there are multiple ways to define fairness, one common approach is to try to maximize the minimum value that each agent receives. This can be a complex optimization problem, but for this example, we'll try a simple allocation strategy that attempts to balance the total value each agent receives.

Let's consider the following approach:
1. Calculate the total value of all items for each agent.
2. Assign each agent the item they value the most, one by one, ensuring each item is only assigned once.
3. Continue assigning items to agents until all items are distributed.

Let's calculate the total value of items for each agent and proceed with the allocation:

Agent 0: Total value = 47 + 82 + 99 + 49 + 48 + 90 = 415  
Agent 1: Total value = 68 + 97 + 36 + 24 + 41 + 35 = 301  
Agent 2: Total value = 43 + 91 + 76 + 78 + 28 + 41 = 357  
Agent 3: Total value = 22 + 43 + 87 + 72 + 47 + 93 = 364  
Agent 4: Total value = 25 + 50 + 72 + 43 + 9 + 5 = 204  

Now, let's allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 gets item 2 (value: 99).
2. Agent 1 gets item 1 (value: 97).
3. Agent 3 gets item 5 (value: 93).
4. Agent 2 gets item 3 (value: 78).
5. Agent 4 gets item 4 (value: 9).
6. Agent 0 gets item 0 (value: 47).

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and the total number of items is 6.

The final allocations in JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```
