Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 72.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  76   2  77  35  14   3
1  64  83  72  59  38  52
2   9  70   0  47  29  92
3  97  28  53  42   4  32
4  43  83  11  25  37  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents. One common approach is to allocate items based on maximizing each agent's individual valuation while ensuring that every item is allocated exactly once.

Here's how the allocation might be done:

1. Sort each item by the highest value across all agents.
2. Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item and no item is allocated to more than one agent.

Let's go through the process:

- Item 0: Highest value is 97 by agent 3.
- Item 1: Highest value is 83 by agents 1 and 4. Allocate to agent 1 since agent 1 has a higher sum of unallocated item values.
- Item 2: Highest value is 77 by agent 0.
- Item 3: Highest value is 59 by agent 1, but agent 1 already has an item. Next highest is 47 by agent 2.
- Item 4: Highest value is 38 by agent 1, but agent 1 already has an item. Next highest is 37 by agent 4.
- Item 5: Highest value is 92 by agent 2, who already has an item. Next highest is 52 by agent 1, but agent 1 already has an item. Next highest is 46 by agent 4.

Now, let's allocate the items:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 1.
- Agent 2 gets items 3 and 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 0.
- Agent 4 gets item 4.

Now presenting the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
