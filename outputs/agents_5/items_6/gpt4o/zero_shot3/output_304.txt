Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  50  91  74  23  79  30
1  89  97  41  89  32   4
2  68  25  14  12   6  19
3  51   8  21  57  38   0
4   8  82  12  62  40  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic approach that attempts to maximize the satisfaction of each agent based on their valuations. We can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it most. This approach is not guaranteed to be optimal or perfectly fair due to potential conflicts (i.e., multiple agents valuing the same item highly), but it provides a straightforward allocation.

Let's analyze and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 89 (Agent 1).
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 97 (Agent 1).
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 74 (Agent 0).
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 89 (Agent 1).
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 79 (Agent 0).
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 32 (Agent 4).

Now, we must ensure that every agent gets at least one item if possible, so let's adjust the allocations to distribute items more evenly while respecting the highest valuations:

- Agent 1 has been assigned items 0, 1, and 3. To distribute fairly, let's reallocate some items.
- We'll give item 3 to Agent 3 (next highest value for item 3 after Agent 1).
- Agent 0 can keep item 2 and item 4 (highest values).
- Agent 4 can keep item 5 (highest value).
- We'll give item 1 to Agent 2 to ensure all agents are included.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets items 2, 4
- Agent 1 gets item 0
- Agent 2 gets item 1
- Agent 3 gets item 3
- Agent 4 gets item 5

The allocations in JSON format are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
