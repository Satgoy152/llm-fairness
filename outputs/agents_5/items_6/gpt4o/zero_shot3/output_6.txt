Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  85  17  46  12  14
1  16  75  32  78  56  85
2  77  28  52  54  72  73
3  97  19  65  83  45   7
4  77  39  68   3   4  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total valuation across all agents while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to allocate the items:

1. **Identify the highest valuations**: Start by examining which items are valued most highly by each agent.

2. **Allocate items based on maximum valuation**: Assign items to agents such that each agent receives the item(s) they value the most, without overlapping allocations, and ensuring each item is allocated once.

3. **Ensure all items are allocated**: Make sure all 6 items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item.

Here's an allocation that follows these principles:

- Agent 0 values item 1 the most with a value of 85.
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most with a value of 85.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most with a value of 77.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most with a value of 83.
- Agent 4 values item 2 the most with a value of 68.

Now, we have allocated 5 items. The only remaining item is item 4. We need to allocate item 4 to an agent who does not have an item or whose total valuation would be maximized by this addition. Agent 1 already has an item, so we can assign item 4 to any agent who doesn't have one, or to Agent 4, who values it the most after the initial allocation.

Here's the final allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all 6 items are allocated fairly based on the valuations provided, with each agent receiving at least one item.
