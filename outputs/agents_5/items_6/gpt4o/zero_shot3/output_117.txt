Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  65  49  95  93  70
1  80   4  44  40  66  14
2  80  16  46  13  93  66
3  67  20   0  18  22  55
4  43  76  72  94   5  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations. One common method is to use a greedy approach where we assign items to the agent who values them the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Identify Highest Valuation:** For each item, determine which agent values it the most. 

2. **Allocate Items:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

3. **Balance Allocation:** Adjust allocations so that each agent gets at least one item and total allocations equal the number of items (6 in this case).

Based on the valuations provided:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most (94).
- Item 1: Agent 4 values it the most (76).
- Item 2: Agent 4 values it the most (72).
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most (95).
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it the most (93).
- Item 5: Agent 4 values it the most (86).

Since Agent 0 and Agent 4 have been assigned more than one item and others have none, we need to reallocate to ensure fairness:

- Assign Item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign Item 1 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 3 to Agent 3.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 4.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 4.

Final Allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```

Each agent receives at least one item, and all 6 items are allocated.
