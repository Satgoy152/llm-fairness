Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  51  58  67  48  23
1  26  87  71  69  84  73
2  75  10  56  39  58  62
3  29  43  17  74  32  47
4   7  10  23  14  73  50

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll use a simple allocation approach by considering each agent's highest valued items while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item where possible. Let's proceed with the allocations:

1. Start by identifying the highest value item for each agent:
    - Agent 0 values item 3 the highest (67).
    - Agent 1 values item 1 the highest (87).
    - Agent 2 values item 0 the highest (75).
    - Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (74), but since Agent 0 already has it, let's consider Agent 3's second-highest, which is item 5 (47).
    - Agent 4 values item 4 the highest (73).

2. Distribute the remaining items fairly:
    - Agent 0: Already has item 3.
    - Agent 1: Already has item 1.
    - Agent 2: Already has item 0.
    - Agent 3: Already has item 5.
    - Agent 4: Already has item 4.

3. Allocate any remaining items to balance:
    - Remaining unallocated item is item 2. Assign it to the agent who values it next highest after their highest preference is satisfied. Agent 0 values item 2 at 58, which is the highest remaining unallocated preference.

Final allocation:
- Agent 0: [3, 2]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [0]
- Agent 3: [5]
- Agent 4: [4]

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```
