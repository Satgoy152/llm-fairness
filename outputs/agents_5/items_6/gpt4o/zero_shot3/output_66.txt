Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  18  64  64  55  67  73
1  51  54  73  30  60  87
2  41  32   5  47  57  74
3  21  80   6  62  98  57
4  22  24  62   6   1  32

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the utility or value each agent gets from the items they receive while ensuring every item is assigned to one of the agents.

Here's a step-by-step process to allocate the items:

1. **Agent Preferences**: Determine which items each agent values the most. The higher the valuation, the more desirable the item is for that agent.

2. **Initial Assignment**:
   - Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each item is assigned to exactly one agent.

3. **Adjust to Fairness**:
   - If any agent receives more than one item, compare the values for potentially reassigning items to unallocated or less preferred agents.

Based on the given valuations:

```
Item 0: 
- Agent 1 values it the most at 51

Item 1:
- Agent 3 values it the most at 80

Item 2:
- Agent 1 values it the most at 73

Item 3:
- Agent 3 values it the most at 62

Item 4:
- Agent 3 values it the most at 98

Item 5:
- Agent 1 values it the most at 87
```

An initial assignment based on maximizing each agent's total value while ensuring fairness could be:

- Agent 0: Assign item 2 (value 64) 
- Agent 1: Assign items 0 (value 51) and 5 (value 87)
- Agent 2: Assign item 3 (value 47)
- Agent 3: Assign item 1 (value 80)
- Agent 4: Assign item 4 (value 1)

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Finally, here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
