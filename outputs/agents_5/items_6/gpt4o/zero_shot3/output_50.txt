Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 14.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  78  82  13   5  50
1  83  90  14  23  89   2
2  61  77   2  85   1  66
3  92  58  33  23  31  15
4  47  48  34  14  12  82

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the 6 items fairly among the 5 agents, we need to consider their valuations and try to maximize the total value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item and no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Here's a strategy to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Rank Valuations:** First, examine the values agents assign to items and prioritize allocations accordingly.
2. **Assign Items:** Try to assign items in a way that balances total values across agents. Each agent should get at least one item.

Based on the given values, let's perform this allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 2 highly (82), so we assign item 2 to Agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 highly (90), so we assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 3 highly (85), so we assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly (92), so we assign item 0 to Agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly (82), so we assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we have assigned 5 items, with each agent receiving one. We still have item 4 left, which can be assigned to the agent with the next highest valuation:

- Agent 1 values item 4 highly (89) after item 1, so it would be reasonable to assign item 4 to Agent 1. This also helps in balancing the value received by each agent.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and that a total of 6 items are allocated.
