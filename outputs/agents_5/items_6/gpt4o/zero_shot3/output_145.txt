Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  95  33  93  66  53
1  13  19  21  21  51  45
2  63  13  56  70  13   8
3  58   3   1  44  25  53
4  98  25  30  78  13  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing the total value across all agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and every item is allocated to one agent.

Here is one way to allocate the items based on their valuations:

- Assign item 0 to agent 4, since agent 4 values it the highest (98).
- Assign item 1 to agent 0, since agent 0 values it the highest (95).
- Assign item 2 to agent 2, since agent 2 values it highly (56) compared to others.
- Assign item 3 to agent 0, since agent 0 values it the highest (93).
- Assign item 4 to agent 1, since agent 1 values it the most (51) among the remaining choices.
- Assign item 5 to agent 4, who values it at 87, which is the highest left.

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated and maximizes the total value to the agents:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 5]
}
```

This allocation takes into account the preferences and ensures that every item is allocated fairly based on the valuations.
