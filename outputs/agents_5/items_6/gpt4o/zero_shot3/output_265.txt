Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 44.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  70  92  48  70  45
1  57  18  44  14   7  52
2  26   8  19  79  85  67
3  72  77  98  46   5  35
4  64  61  96  55  66  45

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their valuations. This often involves trying to ensure that each agent receives the items they value the most, while also ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Let's examine the valuation matrix and try to allocate the items:

```
Valuation Matrix:
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  70  92  48  70  45
1  57  18  44  14   7  52
2  26   8  19  79  85  67
3  72  77  98  46   5  35
4  64  61  96  55  66  45
```

We will follow a greedy approach where we try to assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible:

1. Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 86.
2. Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 77.
3. Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 98. Since agent 3 already has item 1, we reconsider and assign it to agent 4 who values it at 96.
4. Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 79.
5. Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most at 85. Since agent 2 already has item 3, we reconsider and assign it to agent 0 who values it at 70.
6. Item 5: Agent 2 values it the most at 67.

Now, let's ensure all items are allocated and each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Agent 0 gets item 0 and item 4.
- Agent 1 gets no items based on the current allocation.
- Agent 2 gets item 3 and item 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 2.

However, to ensure a fair allocation, let's try to adjust so that each agent gets at least one item if possible:

- Reallocate item 4 to agent 1 instead of agent 0 to ensure agent 1 gets at least one item.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0 gets item 0.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 3 and item 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets item 2.

Here is the resultant allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [2]
}
```
