Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 51.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  25  16  51  55   6
1  34  36  51  58  27  21
2   3  68  78  95  20  30
3  49  72   9  48   8  10
4  17  96  92  80  88  66

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that attempts to maximize the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are allocated. We want to make sure that the allocation is as fair as possible, considering the given valuations.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the most, so we will assign item 4 to agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 3 the most, so we will assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the most, but since it's already taken, we assign item 2 to agent 2.
4. Agent 3 values item 1 the most, so we will assign item 1 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the most, but since it's already taken, we assign item 5 to agent 4.
6. Agent 2 also values item 0 next, so we will assign item 0 to agent 2.

Let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 0],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.
