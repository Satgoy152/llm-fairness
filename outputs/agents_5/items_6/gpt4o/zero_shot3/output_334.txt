Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   9  24  27  81  88  41
1  24  65  21  48  12  17
2  97  59   2   5  21  15
3  71  14  38  83  49  23
4   9  12  93  59  18  97

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a method that tries to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One approach is to allocate items such that each agent receives at least one of the items they value highly. 

Let's proceed with a simple allocation strategy:

1. Look at the highest value each agent has for any item and try to allocate that item to them if it hasn't been allocated yet.
2. If multiple agents value an item highly, prioritize the agent with the least number of items.
3. Continue the process until all items are allocated.

Let's apply this strategy step by step:

- Agent 0 values item 4 the most (88), so allocate item 4 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most (65), allocate item 1 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (97), allocate item 0 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 3 the most (83), allocate item 3 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 5 the most (97), allocate item 5 to agent 4.

Now only item 2 is left unallocated. Let's allocate it to the agent who would get the highest value from it among those with the least items:

- Agent 4 values item 2 the most (93) among those who have fewer items, allocate item 2 to agent 4.

The allocations are:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent gets at least one item.
