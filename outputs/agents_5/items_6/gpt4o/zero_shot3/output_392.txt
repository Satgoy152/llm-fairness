Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 74.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  92  77  74  41  57
1  61  73  74  24  22  67
2   8   2  52  74  87  65
3  87  71  33   9   7  78
4  99  91  10  36  53  27

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent gets an item that maximizes their satisfaction given their preferences. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Calculate Total Valuation**: Sum the valuation for each item across all agents to understand the distribution of preferences.
2. **Assign High-Value Items**: Start by assigning items that have significantly higher valuations for certain agents compared to others, ensuring those agents get their most desired items.
3. **Balance Remaining Allocations**: Distribute the remaining items in a way that maximizes the overall happiness of the agents while ensuring that each item is assigned to only one agent.

Based on the given valuations, let's proceed with the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Values item 1 the highest (92), followed by item 3 (74).
- **Agent 1**: Values item 0 the highest (61), followed by item 5 (67).
- **Agent 2**: Values item 4 the highest (87).
- **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the highest (78).
- **Agent 4**: Values item 0 the highest (99) and item 1 (91).

**Allocation Strategy**:

1. **Item 1** can be assigned to **Agent 0** (highest valuation among all agents).
2. **Item 0** can be assigned to **Agent 4** (highest valuation among all agents).
3. **Item 5** can be assigned to **Agent 3** (highest valuation among all agents).
4. **Item 4** can be assigned to **Agent 2** (highest valuation among all agents).
5. **Item 3** can be assigned to **Agent 0** (next highest preference after item 1).
6. **Item 2** can be assigned to **Agent 1** (remaining item to balance distribution).

Now, with this allocation, let's summarize the results:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to one agent, and each agent receives a number of items based on their preferences, leading to a fair distribution.
