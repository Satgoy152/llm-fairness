Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 32.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  65  32  25  70  63
1  20  64  32  78  97  68
2  66   7  41  55  92  22
3   1  20  19  38   0  20
4  53  97   4  70  48   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction based on the given valuations, while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a potential allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** 
   - Highest valued item is 0 with a value of 94.
   
2. **Agent 1:** 
   - Highest valued item is 4 with a value of 97.
   
3. **Agent 2:** 
   - Highest valued item is 4 with a value of 92, but it is already assigned to agent 1. So, allocate item 3 with a value of 55.
   
4. **Agent 3:** 
   - No item has a high value for this agent. Allocate item 5 with a value of 20.
   
5. **Agent 4:** 
   - Highest valued item is 1 with a value of 97.

Now, allocate the remaining items:

- Item 2 remains. Agent 0 has a value of 32, which is the highest unallocated value for item 2.

Based on this strategy, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are allocated, and each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their satisfaction based on the given valuations.
