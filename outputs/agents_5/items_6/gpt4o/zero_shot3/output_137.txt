Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  52  29  48  85  18  38
1   0  79  27  83  12  69
2  26  86  44  81   6  85
3  60  83  44  97  76  76
4  99  13   6  33  90  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and attempt to maximize overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will necessarily receive two items.

Let's consider the valuations and try to allocate items in a fair manner:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the highest (85). Let's allocate item 3 to agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 1 the highest (79). Let's allocate item 1 to agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 the highest (86), but since item 1 is already allocated, let's allocate item 5 to agent 2, which they value second highest (85).
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 the highest (97). Since item 3 is taken, we look at their next highest, which is item 1 (83), but that's also taken. Next is item 5 (76), but that's also taken. Their next highest available is item 0 (60). Let's allocate item 0 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 0 the highest (99), but since item 0 is taken, we'll allocate item 4 to agent 4, which they value second highest (90).

Now, we have:
- Agent 0 has item 3
- Agent 1 has item 1
- Agent 2 has item 5
- Agent 3 has item 0
- Agent 4 has item 4

We've allocated 5 items. There's one more item left, which is item 2. Let's allocate item 2 to the agent who values it the most among those who have only one item. 

- Agent 0 values item 2 at 48
- Agent 1 values item 2 at 27
- Agent 2 values item 2 at 44
- Agent 3 values item 2 at 44
- Agent 4 values item 2 at 6

Agent 0 values item 2 the highest among those who have only one item. Let's allocate item 2 to agent 0.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```
