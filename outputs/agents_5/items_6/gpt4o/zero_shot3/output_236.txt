Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   1  44  77  84  79  74
1  54  81  56  69  61  22
2  93   7  41  40  91  63
3  97  75  32  63  99  51
4  18  56  94  75  12  23

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 1 44 77 84 79 74]
 [54 81 56 69 61 22]
 [93  7 41 40 91 63]
 [97 75 32 63 99 51]
 [18 56 94 75 12 23]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we want to ensure that the allocations maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. Given the valuations table, we can attempt to assign items to agents such that the total value each agent receives is as balanced as possible. Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign item 3 (value 84) and item 5 (value 74).
2. **Agent 1**: Assign item 1 (value 81).
3. **Agent 2**: Assign item 4 (value 91).
4. **Agent 3**: Assign item 0 (value 97).
5. **Agent 4**: Assign item 2 (value 94).

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and attempts to balance the values as fairly as possible.

Here are the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [3, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
