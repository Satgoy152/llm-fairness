Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  64  87   1  28  89
1  37  85  86  70  22  18
2  30   0  72  68  81  66
3  36  45  65  82  55  13
4  72  64   1  23  58  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and that all items are allocated, we should consider the valuations provided by each agent for each item. The goal is to maximize the total satisfaction while ensuring fairness in the distribution. Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that takes into account these considerations:

1. **Identify the highest bidder for each item:** Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most, to maximize satisfaction.

2. **Ensure fair distribution:** If any agent ends up with no items, we may need to adjust the allocation slightly to ensure fairness or consider a balanced distribution approach.

Let's allocate the items based on these principles:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most with a valuation of 88.
- Item 1: Agent 1 values it the most with a valuation of 85.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it the most with a valuation of 87.
- Item 3: Agent 3 values it the most with a valuation of 82.
- Item 4: Agent 2 values it the most with a valuation of 81.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it the most with a valuation of 89.

Based on this allocation, Agent 0 ends up with three items, which is more than the others. To balance this, we can reallocate some items while ensuring total satisfaction remains reasonably high.

Let's adjust:

- Assign Item 5 to Agent 4 instead of Agent 0, as Agent 4 also values Item 5 relatively high (16, compared to its other low valuations).

Now, let's finalize the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the items are distributed fairly based on their valuations.
