Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  70  85  15  62  42  90
1  22  48  53  16  50  47
2   2  93  53  18  36   3
3  20  33  75  51  56  35
4  33  38  17  17  97   7

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that tries to maximize the value each agent receives, ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and that all items are allocated.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Has high valuations for items 0 (70), 1 (85), and 5 (90).
   - Allocate item 5 since it has the highest value for Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Has a relatively balanced valuation, but item 2 (53) stands out.
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Has extremely high valuation for item 1 (93).
   - Allocate item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Has a high valuation for item 2 (75) but it's already taken.
   - Item 3 has a moderate valuation (51) for Agent 3.
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Has very high valuation for item 4 (97).
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

6. **Unallocated items**:
   - Only item 0 remains unallocated.
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 0, who also had a high valuation for it (70).

Let's compile these allocations into the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated, agents may receive multiple items, and the allocation respects the agents' high valuations as much as possible.
