Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 77.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  69  12  51  23  55  82
1  52  51  77  65  65  56
2  98  78  67  61  50  53
3  21  46  91  87  49  99
4  93  84  51  45  55  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52 51 77 65 65 56]

 [93 84 51 45 55 94]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. One common method is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here's how the allocation could look based on the given valuations:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (98).
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is by agent 4 (84).
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (91).
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (87).
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (55).
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is by agent 3 (99).

Based on this allocation, agent 3 receives more items than others. To ensure a fair distribution, we will adjust the allocation to ensure each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's the fair and adjusted allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 4
- Agent 1: Item 2
- Agent 2: Item 0
- Agent 3: Item 3, Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 1

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3, 5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
