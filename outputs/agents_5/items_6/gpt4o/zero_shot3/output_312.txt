Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 15.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  29  84  40  88  67  20
1  37  31  15  85   3  62
2  71  69  26  21  48  12
3  67  37  69  92  43  19
4  50   8  91  17  21  24

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to balance the total value each agent receives according to their valuations. Here is one way to allocate the items:

1. Start by examining the highest valuations to ensure agents get items they value highly.
2. Distribute the items while ensuring each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.

Let's go through the process:

- Assign item 3 to agent 3 who values it the highest at 92.
- Assign item 0 to agent 0 who values it the highest at 29.
- Assign item 2 to agent 4 who values it the highest at 91.
- Assign item 1 to agent 0 who values it the second highest at 84.
- Assign item 4 to agent 0 who values it the highest at 67.
- Assign item 5 to agent 1 who values it the highest at 62.

Now, let's present the allocations in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is assigned to the agent who values it most highly among the available options, and each agent ends up with an integer number of items.
