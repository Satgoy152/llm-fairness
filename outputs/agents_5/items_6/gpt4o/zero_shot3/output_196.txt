Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  63   4  37  81  50
1  65  22  63  26  52  11
2  43  73  29  82  34  39
3   8  66  94  35  35  10
4  25  88  47  32  59  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65 22 63 26 52 11]
 [43 73 29 82 34 39]

 [25 88 47 32 59 65]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that each agent gets a selection of items that maximizes their total valuation. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive two items while the others receive one each.

Let's analyze the table and make allocations based on the highest valuations:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 the highest (81).
2. Agent 1 values item 0 the highest (65).
3. Agent 2 values item 3 the highest (82).
4. Agent 3 values item 2 the highest (94).
5. Agent 4 values item 1 the highest (88).

In this scenario, each agent gets one item that they value the most. For the remaining item, we will look at the next highest valuations:

- The remaining item is item 5. The highest valuation for item 5 is by Agent 4 (65). Since Agent 4 already received one item, they will get the second item based on their next highest valuation.

Thus, the allocation can be:

- Agent 0: [4]
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [3]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [1, 5]

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 5]
}
```
