Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57   9  81  95  54  21
1  82  43  34  32  33   5
2  20  43   7  48  59   4
3  23  55  81  21  82  77
4  38   8  19  21  42  76

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we should consider the agents' valuations of each item and strive to maximize each agent's satisfaction. We can use a simple heuristic approach to ensure that each agent receives at least one item and that the total allocation is fair and optimal based on the valuations.

Let's analyze the given valuations and try to distribute the items:

1. Start by assigning each agent their highest valued item available.
2. Ensure that all items are assigned and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0's highest valuation is for item 3 (value 95).
- Agent 1's highest valuation is for item 0 (value 82).
- Agent 2's highest valuation is for item 4 (value 59).
- Agent 3's highest valuation is for item 4 (value 82), but since item 4 is already taken by agent 2, we give agent 3 item 2 (value 81).
- Agent 4's highest valuation is for item 5 (value 76).

Now, all agents have at least one item. Let's check which items are remaining and allocate them:

- Remaining items: 1.

Allocate the remaining item to the agent who values it most and has not yet received their top choice:

- Item 1 (value 55) to agent 3.

Final allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items that they value highly while all items are fairly distributed.
