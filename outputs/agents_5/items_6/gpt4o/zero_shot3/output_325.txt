Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  17  59  13  34  38
1  37  61  10  79  58  51
2  46   9  42  74  80  88
3   7   5  15  89   9  12
4  97  35  30  96  79  59

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. This is a combinatorial optimization problem, often approached using methods like maximum weight matching or other allocation algorithms. 

Here is one way to allocate the items based on maximizing each agent's total valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item:

1. Sort each agent's valuations for the items in descending order and try to assign the highest-valued items to each agent in a round-robin fashion to ensure fair distribution.

Given the valuations matrix:

```
Agent 0: [5, 17, 59, 13, 34, 38]
Agent 1: [37, 61, 10, 79, 58, 51]
Agent 2: [46, 9, 42, 74, 80, 88]
Agent 3: [7, 5, 15, 89, 9, 12]
Agent 4: [97, 35, 30, 96, 79, 59]
```

Let's allocate the items based on the highest valuations for each agent:

- Agent 0 receives item 2 (value 59).
- Agent 1 receives item 3 (value 79).
- Agent 2 receives item 5 (value 88).
- Agent 3 receives item 0 (value 7).
- Agent 4 receives item 4 (value 79).

We've allocated 5 items so far. Now, let's distribute the remaining item 1:

- Assign item 1 to Agent 1, as they have the second-highest value for it (61).

Thus, the items are allocated as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed fairly among the agents while considering their preferences.
