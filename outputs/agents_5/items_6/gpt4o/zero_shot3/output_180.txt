Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 54.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  66  16  25   1  79  59
1  65   2  54  91  43  67
2  51  26   9  65  85  39
3  47  53  58  95  11  35
4  43  70  38   8   1   9

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [65  2 54 91 43 67]
 [51 26  9 65 85 39]

 [43 70 38  8  1  9]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. We also need to ensure that all 6 items are allocated, and some agents may receive more than one item if necessary.

Let's evaluate and allocate the items:

1. **Item 0**:
   - Highest value: Agent 0 (66)
2. **Item 1**:
   - Highest value: Agent 4 (70)
3. **Item 2**:
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (58)
4. **Item 3**:
   - Highest value: Agent 3 (95)
5. **Item 4**:
   - Highest value: Agent 2 (85)
6. **Item 5**:
   - Highest value: Agent 1 (67)

Now, let's assign these items ensuring each agent receives at least one item:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0
- **Agent 1**: Item 5
- **Agent 2**: Item 4
- **Agent 3**: Items 2, 3
- **Agent 4**: Item 1

All 6 items have been allocated, and each agent has received at least one item. Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
