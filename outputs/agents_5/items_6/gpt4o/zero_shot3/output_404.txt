Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  31  47  10   0  60
1  13  99  64  26  20  18
2  10   8  62  74  61  84
3  93   2   8  69  12  97
4  66  84  15  68  16  63

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[38 31 47 10  0 60]
 [13 99 64 26 20 18]
 [10  8 62 74 61 84]
 [93  2  8 69 12 97]
 [66 84 15 68 16 63]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple heuristic to maximize the total valuation. One strategy is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most. Here is a step-by-step allocation based on the given valuations:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is 93 by agent 3.
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is 99 by agent 1.
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is 64 by agent 1.
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is 74 by agent 2.
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is 61 by agent 2.
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is 97 by agent 3.

Now, let's allocate the items based on these selections:

- Agent 0: No items are the highest value for this agent.
- Agent 1: Items 1 and 2.
- Agent 2: Items 3 and 4.
- Agent 3: Items 0 and 5.
- Agent 4: No items are the highest value for this agent.

Here is the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [1, 2],
    "2": [3, 4],
    "3": [0, 5],
    "4": []
}
```
