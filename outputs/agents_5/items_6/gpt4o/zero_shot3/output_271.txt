Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  69  41  46  58  53
1  74  68  78  96   6  62
2  37  51  83  45  80  64
3   0  72  51   8   9  60
4  23  50  45  94  45  28

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[78 69 41 46 58 53]
 [74 68 78 96  6 62]
 [37 51 83 45 80 64]
 [ 0 72 51  8  9 60]
 [23 50 45 94 45 28]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that maximizes the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. Let's consider a possible allocation:

1. Start by assigning the item with the highest value for each agent.
2. Then, assign the remaining items based on maximizing the overall valuation.

Here's a step-by-step allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (78), so assign item 0 to agent 0.
- Agent 1 values item 3 the most (96), so assign item 3 to agent 1.
- Agent 2 values item 2 the most (83), so assign item 2 to agent 2.
- Agent 3 values item 1 the most (72), so assign item 1 to agent 3.
- Agent 4 values item 3 the most (94), but it's already assigned, so assign the next highest valued item, item 4 (45), to agent 4.

Now, only item 5 is left. To maximize the total valuation:

- Assign item 5 to agent 2, as agent 2 has a relatively high valuation for item 5 (64).

Here's the final allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4]
}
```
