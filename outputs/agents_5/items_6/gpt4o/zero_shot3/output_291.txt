Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  41  53   7  41  56
1  56  22  68  98   4  38
2  15  10  82  39  94   1
3  13  50  60  75  61  10
4  16  90  12  77  49  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the overall satisfaction of the agents by considering their valuations for each item. The goal is to distribute the items in such a way that each agent receives an integer number of items and that the overall distribution is as fair as possible given the valuations.

One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items based on the highest valuation remaining. Here's how we can allocate the items:

1. **Item 0** is most valued by Agent 0 (value of 81).
2. **Item 1** is most valued by Agent 4 (value of 90).
3. **Item 2** is most valued by Agent 2 (value of 82).
4. **Item 3** is most valued by Agent 1 (value of 98).
5. **Item 4** is most valued by Agent 2 (value of 94).
6. **Item 5** is most valued by Agent 0 (value of 56).

With this allocation strategy, we ensure that each item is given to the agent who values it the most. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [1]
}
```

In this allocation, each item is assigned, and while Agent 3 receives no items, they are included in the JSON with an empty list. This allocation ensures that each agent gets the items they value the highest, maximizing overall satisfaction.
