Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  67  41  63  21  80
1  99  24   6  19  32  84
2  43  58  34  87   2  25
3  67  82  74  55  68   3
4  24  79   8  36  89  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we will try to ensure that each agent receives items they value highly while also ensuring that all items are allocated. We aim to maximize the sum of valuations across all agents.

Let's evaluate the situation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Values item 5 highly (80).
   - Other notable values: item 3 (63).

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Values item 0 highly (99).

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Values item 3 highly (87).

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Values item 1 highly (82).

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Values item 4 highly (89).

Now, we will allocate based on the highest valuations while ensuring each item is assigned:

- **Agent 0:** Assign item 5 because it has the highest value (80) for this agent.
- **Agent 1:** Assign item 0 because it has the highest value (99) for this agent.
- **Agent 2:** Assign item 3 because it has the highest value (87) for this agent.
- **Agent 3:** Assign item 1 because it has the highest value (82) for this agent.
- **Agent 4:** Assign item 4 because it has the highest value (89) for this agent.

This allocation leaves item 2 unassigned, which none of the agents value highly. We can assign item 2 to Agent 3, as it has the second-highest value (74) for that agent.

Let's present the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives items they value highly.
