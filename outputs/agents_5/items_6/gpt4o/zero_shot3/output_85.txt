Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 67.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  53  60  27   2  64  43
1  52   1  67  23  19  88
2  76  57  96  97  70  73
3  53  90  41  95  27   2
4  34  81  12   9  33  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [52  1 67 23 19 88]

 [34 81 12  9 33 16]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we should aim to maximize each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations of the items. A fair allocation could be achieved by ensuring that each agent receives items that have higher valuations for them compared to others.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 1 (60) and 4 (64).
- Agent 1 has high valuations for items 2 (67) and 5 (88).
- Agent 2 has high valuations for items 2 (96), 3 (97), and 0 (76).
- Agent 3 has high valuations for items 1 (90) and 3 (95).
- Agent 4 has high valuations for item 1 (81).

A possible fair allocation could be:

- Agent 0 gets items 0 and 4.
- Agent 1 gets items 2 and 5.
- Agent 2 gets item 3.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets no items.

Here's the allocation in the desired JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": []
}
```
