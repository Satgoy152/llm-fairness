Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  16  69  13  75  36
1  32   8  69  51  27  78
2  42  84  24  56  60  21
3  11  95  69  79  46  67
4  79  81  30  39  70  55

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use the concept of maximizing each agent's total valuation of the items they receive. This approach attempts to ensure that each agent receives items that they value highly.

Let's consider each agent's preferences, aiming to maximize their total valuation:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valued items: 4 (75), 2 (69), 5 (36)
   
2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valued items: 5 (78), 2 (69), 3 (51)
   
3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valued items: 1 (84), 4 (60), 3 (56)
   
4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valued items: 1 (95), 3 (79), 5 (67)
   
5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valued items: 0 (79), 1 (81), 4 (70)

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents:

- Allocate item 4 to Agent 0, as it has the highest value for them.
- Allocate item 2 to Agent 1, as it is one of the highest valued items for them.
- Allocate item 1 to Agent 2, as it is the highest valued item for them.
- Allocate item 3 to Agent 3, as it is one of the highest valued items for them.
- Allocate item 0 to Agent 4, as it is the highest valued item for them.

Now, one item remains (item 5). Let's allocate it to the agent who values it the most:

- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (78).

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives the items they value highly, while all items are distributed.
