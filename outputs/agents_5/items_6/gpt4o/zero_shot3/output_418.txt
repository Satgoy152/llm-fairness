Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39  33  81  58  34  71
1  69  49  71  82   7  70
2  56  79  19  57  78  32
3  12   2  31  71  65  95
4  57  36  87  30   5  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a strategy such as maximizing the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

- First, determine which items have the highest valuation for each agent and attempt to assign those items to them.
- Ensure that each agent gets at least one item.
- Check if the allocation is complete, i.e., all items are assigned. If not, reassign items to maximize the total valuation.

Let's proceed with this approach and allocate the items:

1. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 2 (81).
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (82).
3. Agent 2 has the highest valuation for item 1 (79).
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 5 (95).
5. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 2 (87), but since it's already taken, we assign item 0 (57) as it's the next highest available.

Now, we need to allocate the remaining items:
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2 as it provides a higher total valuation.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1, 4],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6.
