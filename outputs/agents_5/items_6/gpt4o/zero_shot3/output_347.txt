Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  33  83  57  66   6
1  64  49  81  15  99  77
2  17  31  81  44   2  75
3  66  40  45  65  93  66
4  17  91  62  99  57  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize overall satisfaction by ensuring that each agent receives items they value highly. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm, where we assign items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation for Each Item:** For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Assign Items Based on Highest Valuation:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that every agent receives at least one item.

3. **Ensure All Items are Allocated:** Adjust allocations if necessary to ensure all items are distributed and each agent gets at least one item.

Let's apply this approach to the given data:

**Item 0:** 
- Agent 3 values it the most at 66.

**Item 1:** 
- Agent 4 values it the most at 91.

**Item 2:** 
- Agent 0 values it the most at 83.

**Item 3:** 
- Agent 4 values it the most at 99.

**Item 4:** 
- Agent 1 values it the most at 99.

**Item 5:** 
- Agent 2 values it the most at 75.

Now, let's ensure that each agent gets at least one item:

- **Agent 0:** Initially gets item 2.
- **Agent 1:** Initially gets item 4.
- **Agent 2:** Initially gets item 5.
- **Agent 3:** Initially gets item 0.
- **Agent 4:** Initially gets items 1 and 3.

Currently, agent 4 has more items than others. To balance, we can transfer item 1 to agent 0, who doesn't have a second item yet. This results in:

- **Agent 0:** Items 2, 1
- **Agent 1:** Item 4
- **Agent 2:** Item 5
- **Agent 3:** Item 0
- **Agent 4:** Item 3

This distribution ensures that each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3]
}
```
