Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 10.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  19  47   9  26  14  55
1  84  29  10  79  93  66
2  46  54  46  26  82  47
3  12  49  66  68   9   5
4  51  11   0  35  75  21

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that aims to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Given the constraints, we'll try to distribute the items based on maximizing the individual agentâ€™s gain from each item, ensuring fairness and coverage.

Let's analyze the values and allocate:

1. **Agent 1** has the highest value for item 4 (93), so assign item 4 to agent 1.
2. **Agent 0** has the highest value for item 5 (55), so assign item 5 to agent 0.
3. **Agent 2** has the highest value for item 3 (26, which is tied with agent 0, but agent 2 has a better overall distribution for other items), so assign item 3 to agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** has the highest value for item 2 (66), so assign item 2 to agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** has the highest value for item 0 (51), so assign item 0 to agent 4.
6. **Finally**, the unallocated item 1 can be assigned to agent 2, as they have the next highest value for it (54).

This distribution ensures each agent gets a fair chance based on their valuations and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0]
}
```
