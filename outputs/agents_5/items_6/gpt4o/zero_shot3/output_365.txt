Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 92.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  86  25   9  88  43
1  88  58  92  96  24  54
2  68  76  65  22  43  52
3   9  51  46  54  19  84
4  37  81  79  85  76   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a simple method where each agent gets the item they value the most, as long as it has not been taken by another agent. This is a greedy approach which works well with fewer agents and items.

Let's proceed with the allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 4 the highest (88). Assign item 4 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 3 the highest (96). Assign item 3 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 1 the highest (76). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 5 the highest (84). Assign item 5 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 3 the highest (85), but it's already taken by Agent 1. The next highest is item 1 (81), but it's taken by Agent 2. Next is item 2 (79). Assign item 2 to Agent 4.

Now, we have allocated 5 items, and we have one item left (item 0).

Going back to the agents, we check who has the highest valuation for the remaining item 0:

- **Agent 1** values item 0 the highest (88). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

Now, each agent has been considered, and all 6 items have been allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [3, 0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2]
}
```
