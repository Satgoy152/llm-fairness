Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  86  38  84  58  74  23
1   0  61  20   1   5   6
2  68  85  62   4  84  20
3  38  55  92  55  41  12
4  83  91  31  19  97  46

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we'll aim to maximize the total valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated. Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve this:

1. **List the valuations**: 
   - Agent 0: [86, 38, 84, 58, 74, 23]
   - Agent 1: [0, 61, 20, 1, 5, 6]
   - Agent 2: [68, 85, 62, 4, 84, 20]
   - Agent 3: [38, 55, 92, 55, 41, 12]
   - Agent 4: [83, 91, 31, 19, 97, 46]

2. **Initial Assignment (Greedy Approach)**: 
   - Assign each item to the agent that values it the most.

3. **Assign items based on maximum value per item**:
   - Item 0: Agent 0 (86)
   - Item 1: Agent 4 (91)
   - Item 2: Agent 3 (92)
   - Item 3: Agent 0 (58)
   - Item 4: Agent 4 (97)
   - Item 5: Agent 0 (23)

4. **Ensure all agents are considered**:
   - Reevaluate to ensure fair distribution if possible. Adjust if necessary to reduce any zero allocations.

5. **Final Assignment**:
   - Agent 0: Items [0, 3, 5]
   - Agent 1: Items []
   - Agent 2: Items []
   - Agent 3: Items [2]
   - Agent 4: Items [1, 4]

This allocation attempts to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring all items are distributed.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocations:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```
