Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  77   5  77  89  75  76
1  58  30  76  46   7  11
2  25  14  21  18  53  19
3  53  92   7  95  78  16
4   2  71  32  39  24  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering their valuations, one approach is to use the concept of maximizing the total valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the table and make allocations:

- Agent 0 has high valuations for items 0, 2, and 3.
- Agent 1 values item 2 highly.
- Agent 2 doesn't have particularly high valuations, but item 4 has the highest value.
- Agent 3 values items 1 and 3 highly.
- Agent 4 values item 1 highly.

Based on the above observations, a possible allocation could be:

- Assign item 0 and 3 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

This ensures each item is allocated and attempts to respect the preferences inferred from the highest valuations.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
