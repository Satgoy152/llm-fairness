Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 89.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  17  65  18   1  93  65
1  62  29  89  96  15  34
2  55  29  70  74  33  81
3  16  39  71  41  36  30
4  98  63  39  91  59  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider the values each agent places on the items and try to maximize their satisfaction. We will use a simple greedy approach where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation process:

1. Item 0: The highest value is 98 by agent 4. Assign item 0 to agent 4.
2. Item 1: The highest value is 65 by agents 0 and 4. Assign item 1 to agent 0 for diversity.
3. Item 2: The highest value is 89 by agent 1. Assign item 2 to agent 1.
4. Item 3: The highest value is 96 by agent 1. Assign item 3 to agent 1.
5. Item 4: The highest value is 93 by agent 0. Assign item 4 to agent 0.
6. Item 5: The highest value is 81 by agent 2. Assign item 5 to agent 2.

Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed among the agents, maximizing each agent's satisfaction based on their valuations.
