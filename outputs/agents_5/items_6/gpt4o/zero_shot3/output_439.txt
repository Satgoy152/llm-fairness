Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 13.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  90  80   9  37  98  80
1  32  91  13  92  17  95
2  23  21  37  39  79  64
3   3  81  71  40  27  64
4  83  49  42  96  48  51

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total value across all agents while ensuring that each agent receives an integer number of items. One approach to achieve this is to use a variation of the "maximum weighted matching" in bipartite graphs, which is often applied in these types of allocation problems. However, for simplicity, I'll manually assign items by considering each agent's highest valued items until all items are allocated.

Here is a possible fair allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has high valuations for items 0, 1, 4, and 5. We'll allocate items 0 and 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Prefers items 1, 3, and 5. We'll allocate items 1 and 5.
3. **Agent 2**: Has relatively similar valuations and no standout preference. We'll allocate item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a relatively high valuation for item 2. We'll allocate item 2.
5. **Agent 4**: Has a standout preference for item 3, but it's already allocated to Agent 2. Agent 4 doesn't get any items in this allocation.

Following this allocation approach, the items are distributed as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": []
}
```

In this allocation, each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 6 items are fairly allocated based on the given valuations.
