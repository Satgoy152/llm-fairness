Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 40.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  42  58  34  80  10  59
1  39   7  40  95  61  83
2  64  10  61  32  50  42
3  56  49  63  34  46  72
4  70  13  92  70  50  69

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items to agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and distribute them in a way that seems equitable. One approach is to use a method that ensures each agent gets at least one item (if possible) and tries to optimize the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. Assign each agent the item they value the most, if possible, and then allocate the remaining items based on the next highest valuations while ensuring no item is assigned to more than one agent.

Let's evaluate the most valued items for each agent:

- Agent 0: Most valued item is 3 (value 80)
- Agent 1: Most valued item is 3 (value 95)
- Agent 2: Most valued item is 0 (value 64)
- Agent 3: Most valued item is 2 (value 63)
- Agent 4: Most valued item is 2 (value 92)

We'll start with these preferences and adjust to ensure each agent gets at least one item:

1. Assign item 3 to Agent 1 (highest value)
2. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (next highest value)
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 4 (next highest value)
4. Assign item 5 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0)
5. Assign item 4 to Agent 3 (since item 2 is already taken)
6. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (next highest value for Agent 0)

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
