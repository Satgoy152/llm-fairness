Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 61.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  21  73  69  30  19  97
1  31  65  61  92  69  86
2  84  18  30  13   9  85
3  40  39  76  91  39  98
4  64   0  55  37  38  18

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[21 73 69 30 19 97]
 [31 65 61 92 69 86]
 [84 18 30 13  9 85]
 [40 39 76 91 39 98]
 [64  0 55 37 38 18]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives by considering the value each agent has for each item. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (value = 97)
2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (value = 92)
3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value = 84)
4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (value = 98), but it's already taken by Agent 0.
   - Next highest: Item 2 (value = 76)
5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest valuation: Item 0 (value = 64), but it's already taken by Agent 2.
   - Next highest: Item 2 (value = 55), but it's already taken by Agent 3.
   - Next highest: Item 4 (value = 38)

Now, let's assign the remaining items:

- Item 1 can be assigned to Agent 0 (value = 73) as their next best option.
- Item 3 can be assigned to Agent 4 (value = 37) as their next best option.

The allocation is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [5, 1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items based on their highest valuations, and all items are allocated.
