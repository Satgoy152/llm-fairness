Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 86.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  67  30  72   3  41  60
1  82   1  86   1  34   5
2  99  97   9  63  70  47
3  61   5  26  12   0  92
4  69  97  87  87  52  78

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can follow an approach that maximizes the overall satisfaction of the agents based on their valuations. One common method is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. For each item, find the agent who values it the most.
2. Assign the item to that agent.
3. Ensure that each agent receives at least one item if possible.

Applying this method to the given valuations:

- For item 0, the highest valuation is by agent 2 (99).
- For item 1, the highest valuation is by agent 2 (97).
- For item 2, the highest valuation is by agent 1 (86).
- For item 3, the highest valuation is by agent 4 (87).
- For item 4, the highest valuation is by agent 2 (70).
- For item 5, the highest valuation is by agent 3 (92).

Now we ensure that each agent gets at least one item, if possible:

- Agent 0 does not have any item. We can reassign item 5 (valued at 60 by agent 0) from agent 3 to agent 0, as agent 3 also has item 2.

Here is the final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 1, 4],
    "3": [],
    "4": [3]
}
```
