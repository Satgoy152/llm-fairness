Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 47.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  30  85  72  46  78  82
1  62  21  47  67  56  18
2  78  52  62  94  41  27
3  67  33  40  60  72   6
4  13  42  14  70   4  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to consider each agent's valuations and try to distribute the items such that each agent is satisfied according to some fairness criterion. One common approach is maximizing the total sum of valuations or ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible while trying to respect the preferences.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Identify the highest-valued items for each agent** and try to allocate them such that each agent gets an item they value highly.

2. **Ensure each item is allocated exactly once** and all items are distributed among the agents.

Let's perform the allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 1 very highly (85).
- Agent 1 values item 3 highly (67).
- Agent 2 values item 3 highest (94), but since it's already taken by Agent 1, we can give them item 0 (78), which is also highly valued by them.
- Agent 3 values item 4 highly (72).
- Agent 4 values item 5 highly (67).

Now, let's allocate the remaining items:

- After assigning items based on high valuation, we have assigned items 0, 1, 3, 4, and 5. Item 2 is left to be allocated.
- Agent 0 or Agent 2 can receive item 2 because they still have space and value it relatively high compared to other remaining options.

Considering these preferences, here's a possible allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [0, 2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each item is allocated to an agent, and the total number of items allocated is exactly 6. Each agent receives at least one item, and the allocation considers the agents' preferences by assigning items with relatively higher valuations to each.
