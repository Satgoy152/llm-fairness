Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 53.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  31  13  38  31  24  35
1  92  97  53  21   6  31
2  90  13  60  97  13   0
3   1  79  18  77  87  30
4  71  10  13  28  58  34

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize each agent's total valuation while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step approach to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify the Highest Valuation per Item**: For each item, determine which agent values it the most.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate each item to the agent who values it the most.

3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If any agent does not receive any items, adjust the allocation by reallocating items from agents who receive multiple items to those who received none, while trying to minimize the reduction in total valuation.

4. **Check Total Items**: Ensure exactly 6 items are allocated in total.

5. **Convert Allocations to JSON Format**: Present the final allocation in the specified JSON format.

Let's apply this method:

### Initial Analysis
1. **Item 0**: Highest value by agent 1 (92).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value by agent 1 (97).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value by agent 2 (60).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value by agent 2 (97).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value by agent 3 (87).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value by agent 0 (35).

### Initial Allocation
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [0, 1]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: []

### Adjust for Fairness
Agent 4 has no items. We need to reallocate one item from an agent with multiple items to agent 4.

- Consider reallocating item 0 from agent 1 to agent 4 (agent 1 still has item 1).

### Final Allocation
- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [2, 3]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [0]

### JSON Format
```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```
This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and all items are distributed.
