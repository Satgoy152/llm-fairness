Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  16  49  60  61  68
1  58  92  43  65  81  65
2  17  76  52  77  48  71
3  72  93  29  25  36  97
4  10   2  78  62  63  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes each agent's utility based on their valuations while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible. Given there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive at least two items.

Here's one way to allocate the items fairly:

1. Assign the highest-valued item for each agent first.
2. If any items are left unallocated, assign them to the agent who values them the most among the remaining options.

Let's apply this strategy step-by-step:

- **Agent 0** values item 5 the most at 68.
- **Agent 1** values item 1 the most at 92.
- **Agent 2** values item 3 the most at 77.
- **Agent 3** values item 5 the most at 97. However, since item 5 is already taken, we assign Agent 3 their next highest-valued item, which is item 1 at 93. But item 1 is taken too, so we assign item 0 at 72.
- **Agent 4** values item 5 the most at 94. However, item 5 is taken, so we assign the next highest-valued item, which is item 2 at 78.

After the initial allocation, items 2, 3, and 4 remain unassigned:

- **Item 2** should go to the agent who values it the most among the remaining options. That's Agent 4 at 78.
- **Item 3** can be assigned to Agent 2, who values it at 77.
- **Item 4** should go to Agent 1, who values it at 81.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed while maximizing each agent's benefit based on their preferences.
