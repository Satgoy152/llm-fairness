Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  54   8  13  30   0
1  47  93  68  41  32  48
2  43  34  93  51  23  88
3  42  83  69   7  61  13
4  66  77   0  25  57  29

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[84 54  8 13 30  0]
 [47 93 68 41 32 48]
 [43 34 93 51 23 88]

 [66 77  0 25 57 29]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring that each item is allocated to exactly one agent. This is akin to solving an assignment problem, which can be approached using techniques like the Hungarian algorithm. However, for simplicity, let's manually allocate the items to maximize the overall satisfaction.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**:
   - Item 0: Value = 84
   - Item 4: Value = 30

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Item 1: Value = 93

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Item 2: Value = 93

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Item 3: Value = 7

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Item 5: Value = 29

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives at least one item. The allocation is aimed at maximizing the overall value received by the agents.

Here is the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```
