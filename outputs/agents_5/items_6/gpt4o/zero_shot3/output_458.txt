Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 11.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  29  40  87  91  39
1  24  59  11  83  27  72
2  62  23  77  30  14   1
3  50   4  39  80  47  46
4  76  90  75  69  79   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. Let's analyze the given matrix to determine the optimal allocation:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  23  29  40  87  91  39
1  24  59  11  83  27  72
2  62  23  77  30  14   1
3  50   4  39  80  47  46
4  76  90  75  69  79   4
```

**Approach:**

- We will assign the highest value item to each agent initially.
- Then, we'll continue to allocate remaining items to the agents who value them the most until all items are distributed.

**Step-by-Step Allocation:**

1. **Assign the highest value items initially:**
   - Agent 0: Item 4 (value 91)
   - Agent 1: Item 1 (value 59)
   - Agent 2: Item 2 (value 77)
   - Agent 3: Item 3 (value 80)
   - Agent 4: Item 0 (value 76)

2. **Allocate remaining items (Item 5):**
   - Item 5 has the highest value to Agent 1 (value 72), but Agent 1 already has item 1.
   - Next highest value for item 5 is to Agent 3 (value 46), but Agent 3 already has item 3.
   - Next highest value for item 5 is to Agent 0 (value 39), who only has one item so far.

**Final Allocations:**

- Agent 0: Items [4, 5]
- Agent 1: Item [1]
- Agent 2: Item [2]
- Agent 3: Item [3]
- Agent 4: Item [0]

**JSON Representation:**

```json
{
    "0": [4, 5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent receives at least one item.
