Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  82  92  31  52  98  43
1  56  59   6  59   9  93
2   9  48   6  64  13  18
3  97  50  82  57  90  29
4  42  64  24  33  50  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[82 92 31 52 98 43]
 [56 59  6 59  9 93]

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should ensure that each agent receives items in a way that maximizes their valuations while ensuring that all items are allocated. Here's one possible allocation:

1. Agent 0 values item 4 very highly, so we can allocate item 4 to Agent 0.
2. Agent 1 values item 5 the most, so we can allocate item 5 to Agent 1.
3. Agent 3 values item 0 the most, so we allocate item 0 to Agent 3.
4. Agent 4 values item 1 highly, so we can allocate item 1 to Agent 4.
5. Agent 2 can be given item 3, as it is the highest value remaining for any unallocated agent.
6. Finally, item 2 is least valued by Agent 1 compared to other unallocated items, so we will give it to Agent 1.

This distribution attempts to balance the allocations based on the highest personal values for each agent. Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [5, 2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [1]
}
```
