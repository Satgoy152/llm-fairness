Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 64.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  46  43  54  37   0
1  56  44  64  59  31   4
2  62   0  92  43  11  97
3  39  28  52  50  30  11
4   2  48  31  46  88  80

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we aim to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items, and all 6 items are allocated.

We'll consider a strategy that gives each agent their highest-valued items based on their individual preferences. Here's one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value item: 3 (value: 54)
   - Allocate item 3 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**:
   - Highest value item: 2 (value: 64)
   - Allocate item 2 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**:
   - Highest value item: 5 (value: 97)
   - Allocate item 5 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**:
   - Highest value item: 2 (value: 52 - already taken)
   - Next highest value item: 3 (value: 50 - already taken)
   - Next highest value item: 0 (value: 39)
   - Allocate item 0 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**:
   - Highest value item: 4 (value: 88)
   - Allocate item 4 to Agent 4.

After allocating based on the highest values, item 1 remains unallocated. We will assign it to the agent with the next highest valuation that doesn't already have 2 items:

- **Agent 0**: Item 1 (value: 46) is assigned.

This results in the following allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents and each agent receives at least one item.
