Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 60.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99   3  82  70  80   0
1  27  19  60  13  13  53
2  56  97  44   0  87  39
3  51   1  68  80  80  21
4  62  42  47  23  60   0

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [27 19 60 13 13 53]

 [62 42 47 23 60  0]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total satisfaction (value) for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items and that all items are allocated.

Let's analyze the valuations matrix and aim for an allocation that maximizes the overall value:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  99   3  82  70  80   0
1  27  19  60  13  13  53
2  56  97  44   0  87  39
3  51   1  68  80  80  21
4  62  42  47  23  60   0
```

Here's a potential allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Has the highest value for item 0 (value 99). Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Has a moderate value for item 2 (value 60) and item 5 (value 53). Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Has the highest value for item 1 (value 97). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3**: Has a high value for item 3 (value 80) and item 4 (value 80), but item 3 is higher relative to other agents' values. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4**: Has moderate values but is the best fit for item 4 (value 60) given the remaining options. Assign item 4 to Agent 4.

This leaves item 2, which can be allocated to Agent 0, who values it reasonably high (value 82).

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, maximizing overall satisfaction:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```
