Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 34.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  84  97  86  45  24  23
1   5  71  34  96  43  20
2  56   0  12  80  26  67
3  17  26  60  52  69  60
4  23  51  27  24  64  30

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a greedy algorithm. This involves assigning each item to the agent who values it the most. Here’s how the allocations might look:

1. Item 0: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 84.
2. Item 1: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 97.
3. Item 2: The highest valuation is by Agent 0 with 86.
4. Item 3: The highest valuation is by Agent 1 with 96.
5. Item 4: The highest valuation is by Agent 3 with 69.
6. Item 5: The highest valuation is by Agent 2 with 67.

Now, let's ensure each agent gets at least one item if possible. Here’s one possible allocation that tries to balance the distribution:

- Assign Items 0 and 1 to Agent 0.
- Assign Items 2 and 3 to Agent 1.
- Assign Item 5 to Agent 2.
- Assign Item 4 to Agent 3.

Agent 4 does not get any items, as all items have been allocated.

Here's the allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [2, 3],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation attempts to distribute the items while considering agents' preferences and ensuring a fair allocation based on the given valuations.
