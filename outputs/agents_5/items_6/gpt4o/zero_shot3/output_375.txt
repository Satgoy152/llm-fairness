Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 59.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  92  67   4  46  69
1  23   6  59  50  69  71
2  15  12  89  85  78  39
3  65  40  96  21  28  34
4  58  85  53  29  79  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [58 85 53 29 79 83]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each of the 6 items is assigned to exactly one agent, and that the allocation is as fair as possible given the valuation matrix. Here is one possible allocation approach, taking into account the valuations for each item:

1. Assign each item to the agent that values it the most, one by one, while ensuring no agent ends up with too many items. This approach attempts to maximize the total valuation.

Let's allocate:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it the most at 72.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it the most at 92, but we'll give it to Agent 4, who also highly values it at 85 to balance the allocations.
- Item 2: Agent 3 values it the most at 96.
- Item 3: Agent 2 values it the most at 85.
- Item 4: Agent 4 values it the most at 79.
- Item 5: Agent 1 values it the most at 71.

This allocation ensures that each agent has items distributed fairly according to their preferences:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that:
- Each agent gets at least one item.
- Each item is allocated to exactly one agent.
- The allocation takes into account the high valuations while balancing the number of items each agent receives.
