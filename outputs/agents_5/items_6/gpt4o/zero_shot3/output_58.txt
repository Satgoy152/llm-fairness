Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 41.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  27  34  91  32  62  59
1  77  72  41  42  56   9
2  73  85  74  52  85   0
3  29  23  53  93   0  53
4  37  69  15  15  23  40

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we should aim to maximize the valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. We can use a greedy approach, selecting the highest value for each item and assigning it to the corresponding agent.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 0:
   - Item 2, value 91

2. Agent 1:
   - Item 0, value 77

3. Agent 2:
   - Item 1, value 85

4. Agent 3:
   - Item 3, value 93

5. Agent 4:
   - Item 5, value 40

6. Item 4 remains, and its highest value is by Agent 0, with a value of 62.

Thus, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed and each agent gets an integer number of items.
