Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  93  45  86  46  35
1  87  45  37   6  87  38
2  69  73  95  33  15  13
3  94  34  72  44   6  93
4  27  85  92   8  45  38

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes overall satisfaction while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items and a total of exactly 6 items are allocated.

Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign items to agents based on their highest valuation preferences, ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
2. Review and adjust allocations to ensure each agentâ€™s total number of items are integers and the total across agents is 6.

Let's evaluate the allocations:

- Agent 0 values item 1 highly at 93.
- Agent 1 values item 0 highly at 87.
- Agent 2 values item 2 highly at 95.
- Agent 3 values item 0 highly at 94, but it's already chosen by Agent 1, so we consider the next highest, item 5 at 93.
- Agent 4 values item 2 highly at 92, but it's already chosen by Agent 2, so we consider the next highest, item 1 at 85.

After assigning based on the highest valuations, we need to ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 1 (already taken by Agent 0), so reassign to item 4 which is not taken yet.

Now we have the following allocations and need to re-evaluate to ensure all 6 items are allocated. Items 3 and 4 need allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 1
- Agent 1: Item 0
- Agent 2: Item 2
- Agent 3: Item 5
- Agent 4: Item 4
- Remaining item 3 can go to Agent 0, who has only one item and values item 3 at 86.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 3],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation gives each agent an integer number of items and ensures all 6 items are allocated.
