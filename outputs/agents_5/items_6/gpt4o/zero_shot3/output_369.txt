Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  89  18  79  86  16  38
1  21  91  28  38  70  31
2  20  68  50  48  44  87
3  53  47   1  64   4  17
4   6  44  50   6  28   1

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we can use a method that considers maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated. One common approach is to use a greedy algorithm to assign items based on the highest value an agent places on an item that hasn't been allocated yet.

Here is one possible allocation:

1. **Item 0**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 89).
2. **Item 1**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 91).
3. **Item 2**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 79).
4. **Item 3**: The highest valuation is by agent 0 (value 86).
5. **Item 4**: The highest valuation is by agent 1 (value 70).
6. **Item 5**: The highest valuation is by agent 2 (value 87).

Based on these valuations, the items are allocated as follows:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 2, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [1, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: No items
- Agent 4: No items

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents.

Here is the JSON representation of the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 3],
    "1": [1, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [],
    "4": []
}
```
