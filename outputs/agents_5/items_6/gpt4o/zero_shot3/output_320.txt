Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  34  74  27  82  98  59
1  75  86  94  51  78  87
2  34  32  20  89  41  21
3  67  43  94  61   9  31
4  35  23  74  70  60   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a simple algorithm that assigns items to agents based on their highest valuations. This ensures that each agent gets items they value the most, leading to a fair distribution. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Agent 0**: 
   - Highest value for item 4 (value 98).

2. **Agent 1**: 
   - Highest value for item 2 (value 94).

3. **Agent 2**: 
   - Highest value for item 3 (value 89).

4. **Agent 3**: 
   - Highest value for item 2 (value 94), but it is already assigned. 
   - Next highest value for item 0 (value 67).

5. **Agent 4**: 
   - Highest value for item 2 (value 74), but it is already assigned. 
   - Next highest value for item 3 (value 70), but it is already assigned. 
   - Next highest value for item 4 (value 60), but it is already assigned.
   - Next highest value for item 0 (value 35), but it is already assigned.
   - Next highest value for item 1 (value 23).

6. **Unallocated Items**: 
   - Item 1 and 5 are not yet allocated.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0 since they value it highly (value 74).
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 1 since they value it highly (value 87).

Here's the final allocation of items to agents in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [4, 1],
    "1": [2, 5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [0],
    "4": []
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value the most, and all 6 items are allocated.
