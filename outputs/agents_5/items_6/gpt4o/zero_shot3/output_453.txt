Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 43.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   5  98  25  24  90  49
1  15  78  43   1  62  60
2   8  18  59   3  62  85
3  30  19  50  35  46  54
4  71  52  57  32  33   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, with all items being allocated.

Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. Assign item 1 to agent 0 since agent 0 values item 1 the highest at 98.
2. Assign item 0 to agent 4 since agent 4 values item 0 the highest at 71.
3. Assign item 5 to agent 2 since agent 2 values item 5 the highest at 85.
4. Assign item 2 to agent 3 since agent 3 values item 2 the highest at 50.
5. Assign item 4 to agent 1 since agent 1 values item 4 the highest at 62.
6. Assign item 3 to agent 4 since agent 4 has the next highest valuation for item 3 at 32, after agent 0.

This allocation ensures that each agent receives an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

Here is the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```
