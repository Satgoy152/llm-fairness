Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  55  98  64  62  76  94
1  18  31  28  66  96  64
2  47  99  38  87  94  68
3   8  53  72  49  42  42
4  61  80  96  23  50   5

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items and that all 6 items are distributed. One approach is to maximize the overall satisfaction by ensuring that each item is given to the agent who values it the most.

Let's evaluate the maximum value each agent places on the items:

- Item 0: Agent 0 values it at 55, Agent 1 at 18, Agent 2 at 47, Agent 3 at 8, Agent 4 at 61. The highest value is 61 by Agent 4.
- Item 1: Agent 0 values it at 98, Agent 1 at 31, Agent 2 at 99, Agent 3 at 53, Agent 4 at 80. The highest value is 99 by Agent 2.
- Item 2: Agent 0 values it at 64, Agent 1 at 28, Agent 2 at 38, Agent 3 at 72, Agent 4 at 96. The highest value is 96 by Agent 4.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it at 62, Agent 1 at 66, Agent 2 at 87, Agent 3 at 49, Agent 4 at 23. The highest value is 87 by Agent 2.
- Item 4: Agent 0 values it at 76, Agent 1 at 96, Agent 2 at 94, Agent 3 at 42, Agent 4 at 50. The highest value is 96 by Agent 1.
- Item 5: Agent 0 values it at 94, Agent 1 at 64, Agent 2 at 68, Agent 3 at 42, Agent 4 at 5. The highest value is 94 by Agent 0.

Now, let's allocate the items based on the highest valuation:

- Item 0 goes to Agent 4.
- Item 1 goes to Agent 2.
- Item 2 goes to Agent 4.
- Item 3 goes to Agent 2.
- Item 4 goes to Agent 1.
- Item 5 goes to Agent 0.

This way, each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, and all items are distributed. Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
