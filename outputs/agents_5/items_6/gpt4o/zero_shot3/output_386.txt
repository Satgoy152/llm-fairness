Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  81  88  27   8   5  88
1  29  25  81  41  69  60
2  26  50  19  32  65  16
3  23  85  81  99  63  15
4  54  56  53  57  98  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. We have 5 agents and 6 items, so one agent will receive two items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0:** Agent 0 highly values items 0 and 5 (value 81 and 88 respectively). Assign item 5 to agent 0 for maximum value.

2. **Agent 1:** Agent 1 highly values item 2 (value 81). Assign item 2 to agent 1.

3. **Agent 2:** Agent 2 values item 4 the most (value 65). Assign item 4 to agent 2.

4. **Agent 3:** Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 3 (value 99), which is the highest valuation in the table. Assign item 3 to agent 3.

5. **Agent 4:** Agent 4 highly values item 4, but it's already taken. The next highest value is item 1 (value 56). Assign item 1 to agent 4.

Now, we have one item left (item 0) and agent 0 currently has one item, so we can give item 0 to agent 0.

The final allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
