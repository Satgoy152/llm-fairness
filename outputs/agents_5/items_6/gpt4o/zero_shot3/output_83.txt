Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  98  47  54  87  68
1  55  34  33  16  12  28
2  38  66  20   8  51  29
3  43  16  76  36  20  11
4  20  92  62  37  16  43

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate items among the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a method that attempts to maximize the total utility for all agents. One common approach is to ensure that each item is allocated to the agent who values it the most, while making sure every agent gets at least one item. Here's a step-by-step strategy to achieve this:

1. **Identify the highest value for each item**: Determine which agent values each item the most.

2. **Initial Allocation**: Allocate each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item.

3. **Balance Distribution**: If any agent has more items than others, reallocate some items to agents with fewer items, ensuring that the overall allocation remains fair.

Let's follow these steps with the given data:

### Initial Allocation Based on Highest Valuation

- Item 0: Agent 0 (74)
- Item 1: Agent 0 (98)
- Item 2: Agent 3 (76)
- Item 3: Agent 0 (54)
- Item 4: Agent 0 (87)
- Item 5: Agent 0 (68)

### Adjustment for Fair Distribution

Since Agent 0 has received all the items initially, we need to balance the distribution:

1. Allocate Item 2 to Agent 3 as they value it the most.
2. Allocate Item 1 to Agent 4, who also has a high valuation for it.
3. Allocate Item 4 to Agent 2, as they have a high relative valuation compared to others.
4. Allocate Item 5 to Agent 1 to balance the distribution, as Agent 1 needs at least one item.

### Final Allocation

Here's the fair allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives at least one item, and the distribution considers agents' valuations fairly.
