Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 90.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  87  47  56  60  28  64
1  10  80  90  89  26  15
2  95  80  94  76  72  86
3  58  19  95  81  25  55
4  70  27  40  59  21  95

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use a strategy that maximizes the total value each agent receives based on their preferences. We'll start by identifying the highest value items for each agent and ensure everyone gets at least one item, if possible, while trying to balance the overall distribution.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the allocation process:

1. **Identify Priority Items**: Look at each agent's highest valued items.
2. **Assign Items**: Allocate items to agents based on their highest valuation while ensuring each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. **Balance Distribution**: After each agent has been allocated at least one item, distribute the remaining items to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's proceed with this allocation:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest values for items are 87 (item 0), 64 (item 5).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest values for items are 90 (item 2), 89 (item 3).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest values for items are 95 (item 0), 94 (item 2).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest values for items are 95 (item 2), 81 (item 3).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest values for items are 95 (item 5), 70 (item 0).

Given this, a possible fair distribution could be:

- **Agent 0**: Item 0 (value 87)
- **Agent 1**: Item 3 (value 89)
- **Agent 2**: Item 2 (value 94)
- **Agent 3**: Item 1 (value 19)
- **Agent 4**: Item 5 (value 95)

Now, item 4 remains. We will assign it to the agent who has the least total value to balance the allocation:

- **Agent 1** has the least total value (only 89), so they get item 4.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed and each agent receives at least one item, balancing the overall satisfaction based on their valuations.
