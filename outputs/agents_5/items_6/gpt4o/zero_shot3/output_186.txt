Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 27.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  45  54  42  23  70  50
1  90  74  27  34  52  98
2  76  13  14  89  55  97
3  38  76  96  58  52  90
4  69  90   0  44  15  62

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total valuation is as balanced as possible. Here is a possible allocation based on the given valuations:

- **Agent 0**: Items 0 and 1
- **Agent 1**: Item 5
- **Agent 2**: Item 3
- **Agent 3**: Item 2
- **Agent 4**: Items 4

This allocation attempts to balance the total value received by each agent while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items. Now, let's present the allocations in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 1],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are distributed among the agents, and each agent is included in the result, even if they receive no items.
