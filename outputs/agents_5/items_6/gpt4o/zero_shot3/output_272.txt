Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 81.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  38  89  31  90  63  65
1  53  77  81  10  67  11
2  28  71  79  98  25  42
3  82  99  29  78  82  86
4  67  70  57  84  99  13

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we can use a simple greedy algorithm that assigns each item to the agent that values it the most. This approach aims to maximize the total satisfaction across all agents. Here's how the allocation would work for the given table:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 82.

2. **Item 1**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 99.

3. **Item 2**: 
   - Agent 1 values it the most at 81.

4. **Item 3**: 
   - Agent 2 values it the most at 98.

5. **Item 4**: 
   - Agent 4 values it the most at 99.

6. **Item 5**: 
   - Agent 3 values it the most at 86.

However, using this greedy method, Agent 3 ends up with three items while some other agents might not get any. A fair allocation should ensure each agent gets at least one item before any agent gets two. A better approach might involve some backtracking or balancing to ensure fairness. Here's one possible fair allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Item [0]
- **Agent 1**: Item [2]
- **Agent 2**: Item [3]
- **Agent 3**: Item [1]
- **Agent 4**: Items [4, 5]

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item as fairly as possible while keeping the total number of items equal to 6.

Here are the allocations in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
