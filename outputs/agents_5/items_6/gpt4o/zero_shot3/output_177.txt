Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   2  81  42  14  32  38
1  46  98  98   5  60  72
2  84  78  43  67   8  98
3  68   8  68  90  93  65
4  46  88  20  40  43  41

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:
[[ 2 81 42 14 32 38]
 [46 98 98  5 60 72]
 [84 78 43 67  8 98]
 [68  8 68 90 93 65]
 [46 88 20 40 43 41]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we aim to maximize the total valuation while ensuring each agent receives a fair share of items. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, some agents might receive more than one item or none at all. Here's one way to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 1 (81)

2. **Agent 1:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 2 (98)

3. **Agent 2:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 5 (98)

4. **Agent 3:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 4 (93)

5. **Agent 4:**
   - Highest valuation: Item 3 (40)

We have allocated 5 items so far. The remaining item is:

- Item 0: Not allocated yet

To ensure all items are allocated and considering the remaining valuations, we can allocate item 0 to:

- Agent 2, who values it at 84.

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here is the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```
