Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  23  95  92  75  82
1  41  82  45  75  20  98
2  37  87  89   5  43  78
3  79  26  79  99  30  48
4  89  15  43   7  48  86

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to agents, we should consider a method that maximizes the overall valuation for all agents while ensuring each agent receives an integer number of items. Given the table, we can start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here are the valuations for each item:

- Item 0: 
  - Agent 0: 94
  - Agent 1: 41
  - Agent 2: 37
  - Agent 3: 79
  - Agent 4: 89
  - **Assign to Agent 0 (94)**

- Item 1:
  - Agent 0: 23
  - Agent 1: 82
  - Agent 2: 87
  - Agent 3: 26
  - Agent 4: 15
  - **Assign to Agent 2 (87)**

- Item 2:
  - Agent 0: 95
  - Agent 1: 45
  - Agent 2: 89
  - Agent 3: 79
  - Agent 4: 43
  - **Assign to Agent 0 (95)**

- Item 3:
  - Agent 0: 92
  - Agent 1: 75
  - Agent 2: 5
  - Agent 3: 99
  - Agent 4: 7
  - **Assign to Agent 3 (99)**

- Item 4:
  - Agent 0: 75
  - Agent 1: 20
  - Agent 2: 43
  - Agent 3: 30
  - Agent 4: 48
  - **Assign to Agent 0 (75)**

- Item 5:
  - Agent 0: 82
  - Agent 1: 98
  - Agent 2: 78
  - Agent 3: 48
  - Agent 4: 86
  - **Assign to Agent 1 (98)**

After assigning the items based on the highest value for each, here is the allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": []
}
```
