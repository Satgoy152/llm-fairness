Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 50.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  27  82  12  87  39
1  66  16  50  29  71  71
2  90  49  56  73  98  84
3  79  40  84  76  22  37
4  61  91  80   9  97  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the 5 agents, we should consider maximizing the total value for each agent while ensuring that all items are distributed. Since there are 6 items and 5 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each. Here's one way to achieve a fair allocation:

- First, find the agent who values a particular item the highest and assign that item to them.
- If two agents value an item equally, assign it to the one with fewer items allocated so far.
- Continue this process until all items are allocated.

Let's assess the table and allocate the items:

1. Item 0 has the highest value for Agent 2 (value = 90).
2. Item 1 has the highest value for Agent 4 (value = 91).
3. Item 2 has the highest value for Agent 0 (value = 82).
4. Item 3 has the highest value for Agent 3 (value = 76).
5. Item 4 has the highest value for Agent 2 (value = 98) but since item 0 is already allocated to Agent 2, we reassess and allocate item 4 to Agent 4, who values it at 97.
6. Item 5 has the highest value for Agent 4 (value = 85), but Agent 4 already has two items, so we allocate it to Agent 2, who values it at 84.

Allocations based on the above process are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are assigned, and each agent receives an integer number of items, with one agent receiving two items.
