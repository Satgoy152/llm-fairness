Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 71.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  68  12   8  34  13  98
1  71  85  71  35  97  81
2  13  91  15  75  68  87
3  23  97  42   9  41  45
4  13  22  20  75   3  39

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and try to optimize the allocation so that each agent receives items they value highly. Additionally, we need to ensure that all items are allocated and that each agent ends up with an integer number of items.

Here is one possible allocation solution:

1. **Agent 0**: Receives item 5 (value 98)
2. **Agent 1**: Receives item 4 (value 97)
3. **Agent 2**: Receives item 1 (value 91)
4. **Agent 3**: Receives item 3 (value 9)
5. **Agent 4**: Receives items 0 and 2 (values 13 and 20)

Let's verify this allocation:

- **Agent 0** receives item 5, which they value at 98.
- **Agent 1** receives item 4, which they value at 97.
- **Agent 2** receives item 1, which they value at 91.
- **Agent 3** receives item 3, which they value at 9.
- **Agent 4** receives items 0 and 2, which they value at 13 and 20, respectively.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent receives an integer number of items.

Now, present the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [0, 2]
}
```
