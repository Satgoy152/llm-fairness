Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 30.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  92  16  93   9  29  21
1  55  51  30  42  78  13
2  17  52   0  11  41  61
3  59  50  75  28  91  49
4  97  27  53  41  30  85

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure each agent has a reasonable share of the total value based on their individual valuations. Hereâ€™s a possible allocation strategy:

1. Calculate the total value each agent has for all items.
2. Attempt to allocate items such that the total value for each agent is balanced relative to their valuations.

First, we calculate the total value each agent has for all items:

- Agent 0: \(92 + 16 + 93 + 9 + 29 + 21 = 260\)
- Agent 1: \(55 + 51 + 30 + 42 + 78 + 13 = 269\)
- Agent 2: \(17 + 52 + 0 + 11 + 41 + 61 = 182\)
- Agent 3: \(59 + 50 + 75 + 28 + 91 + 49 = 352\)
- Agent 4: \(97 + 27 + 53 + 41 + 30 + 85 = 333\)

Now, try to allocate the items to balance the values:

1. Agent 0: Items 0 and 2, total value = 92 + 93 = 185
2. Agent 1: Items 4, total value = 78
3. Agent 2: Item 5, total value = 61
4. Agent 3: Item 3, total value = 28
5. Agent 4: Item 1, total value = 27

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item and tries to balance the values according to their valuations.

Finally, the allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```

This allocation method attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives a fair share based on their individual preferences and total valuations.
