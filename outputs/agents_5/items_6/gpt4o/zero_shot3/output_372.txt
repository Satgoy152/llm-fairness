Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 52.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  62  79  30  40  84
1   9  98  52  92   0  99
2  46  91   7   9  40  13
3   7  85  96  21  36  70
4  70   4  72  13  24  15

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 5 agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are allocated. Since there are 6 items and 5 agents, one agent will receive 2 items while the others will receive 1 item each.

One approach is to consider each agent's highest-valued items and try to maximize their satisfaction while ensuring every item is assigned. Here's one possible allocation:

- Agent 0 values item 5 the most.
- Agent 1 values item 1 the most.
- Agent 2 values item 1 highly, but since it's taken, we consider item 0.
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most.
- Agent 4 values item 0 highly, but since it's taken, we consider item 2.

Now, since agent 4 didn't get their highest-valued item, we look for a second item for them that maximizes their satisfaction from the remaining items.

Here's the allocation:

- Agent 0: [5]
- Agent 1: [1]
- Agent 2: [4]
- Agent 3: [2]
- Agent 4: [0, 3]

So, the final allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```
