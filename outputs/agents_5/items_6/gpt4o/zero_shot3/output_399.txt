Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  15  85  20  10  86  47
1  99  72  12  42  64  88
2  87  28  71  43  40  96
3  87  91  47  22  74  29
4  30  32  44   2  87  37

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can utilize a method that maximizes the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring that each item is allocated exactly once. This problem can be approached using the concept of maximizing the overall welfare through a greedy algorithm or optimization technique.

Let's analyze the values and distribute the items to maximize the fairness and total value:

1. **Item 0**: The highest value is by agent 1 (99).
2. **Item 1**: The highest value is by agent 3 (91).
3. **Item 2**: The highest value is by agent 0 (20).
4. **Item 3**: The highest value is by agent 2 (43).
5. **Item 4**: The highest value is by agent 0 (86).
6. **Item 5**: The highest value is by agent 2 (96).

Now, let's allocate the items to the agents based on the above analysis:

- Agent 0 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 1 receives item 0.
- Agent 2 receives items 3 and 5.
- Agent 3 receives item 1.
- Agent 4 does not receive any items.

This allocation maximizes the total valuation received by each agent while ensuring that each item is allocated exactly once.

Final allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3, 5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": []
}
```
