Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 69.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  58  76  50  64  51
1  67  55  69   9  37  26
2  15  99  46  76  35  34
3  55  35  41  19  60  48
4  33  16  64  32  23  10

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to maximize the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent receives at least one item and all items are distributed.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: The highest values for Agent 0 are items 0 (80) and 2 (76). Assign items 0 and 2 to Agent 0.

2. **Agent 1**: The highest value for Agent 1 is item 2 (69), but since item 2 is already taken, we consider item 0 (67). Assign item 0 to Agent 1.

3. **Agent 2**: The highest value for Agent 2 is item 1 (99). Assign item 1 to Agent 2.

4. **Agent 3**: The highest values for Agent 3 are items 4 (60) and 0 (55), but since item 0 is taken, we assign item 4 to Agent 3.

5. **Agent 4**: The highest value for Agent 4 is item 2 (64), but since item 2 is taken, we assign item 3 (32) to Agent 4.

Now, let's ensure that all items are distributed:

- Items 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 have been allocated, but item 5 remains. 

To finalize the allocation:

- **Agent 0**: Assign items 0 and 2.
- **Agent 1**: Assign item 3.
- **Agent 2**: Assign item 1.
- **Agent 3**: Assign item 4.
- **Agent 4**: Assign item 5.

This allocation ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are distributed.

Here's the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [5]
}
```
