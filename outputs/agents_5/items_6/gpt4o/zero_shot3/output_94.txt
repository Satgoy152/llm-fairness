Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  41  38  86  51  48   2
1  67  89  42  13  79  31
2  26  55  52  79  74  93
3  10  83  10  33  66   2
4  51  96  59  98  44  64

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents, we need to consider the valuations of each agent for each item and try to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences. The goal is to ensure that all 6 items are allocated to the agents as fairly as possible, taking into account their valuations.

Let's analyze the valuations and allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 2 (86).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (89).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (93).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (83), but it's already taken by Agent 1. Next highest is item 4 (66).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (98).

Based on this analysis, we can attempt the following allocations:

- **Agent 0** will get item 2.
- **Agent 1** will get item 1.
- **Agent 2** will get item 5.
- **Agent 3** will get item 4.
- **Agent 4** will get item 3.

Now we have allocated 5 items, and item 0 remains unallocated. Let's find a suitable agent for item 0:

- **Agent 1** has the second highest valuation for item 0 (67) after item 1.

Thus, we allocate item 0 to Agent 1.

Final allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0, 1],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item based on their preferences and all 6 items are allocated.
