Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  57  86  23  19  13  96
1  39  63  21   1  29   0
2  20  83  24  56   3   6
3  64  47  89  72  51  24
4  82  18  27  94   0   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation across all items is maximized for each agent. This can be a complex optimization problem, but a simple heuristic approach is to assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

Here's a step-by-step approach to allocate the items:

1. Look at each item and determine which agent values it the most.
2. Assign that item to the agent.

Let's go through the items:

- **Item 0**: The highest value is 82 by Agent 4.
- **Item 1**: The highest value is 86 by Agent 0.
- **Item 2**: The highest value is 89 by Agent 3.
- **Item 3**: The highest value is 94 by Agent 4.
- **Item 4**: The highest value is 51 by Agent 3.
- **Item 5**: The highest value is 96 by Agent 0.

Based on this allocation, let's present the results in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [],
    "2": [],
    "3": [2, 4],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```

In this allocation:
- Agent 0 receives items 1 and 5.
- Agent 1 receives no items.
- Agent 2 receives no items.
- Agent 3 receives items 2 and 4.
- Agent 4 receives items 0 and 3.

This allocation assigns all 6 items, ensuring each item goes to the agent who values it the most.
