Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 33.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   4  38   2  21  11  52
1  73  36  33  25  90  27
2  83  23  31   8  39  53
3  74  64  72  48  41  71
4  82  62  63  63  87  49

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can use an approach that tries to maximize the total value each agent receives, while ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items and all items are allocated.

One straightforward approach is to allocate items based on each agent's highest valuation. This means each item is initially proposed to be allocated to the agent who values it the most. 

Let's assign the items based on the highest valuation:

1. **Item 0**: 
   - Valuations: [4, 73, 83, 74, 82]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 2 (value: 83)

2. **Item 1**:
   - Valuations: [38, 36, 23, 64, 62]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 3 (value: 64)

3. **Item 2**:
   - Valuations: [2, 33, 31, 72, 63]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 3 (value: 72)

4. **Item 3**:
   - Valuations: [21, 25, 8, 48, 63]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 4 (value: 63)

5. **Item 4**:
   - Valuations: [11, 90, 39, 41, 87]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 1 (value: 90)

6. **Item 5**:
   - Valuations: [52, 27, 53, 71, 49]
   - Highest valuation: Agent 2 (value: 53)

After assigning based on the highest valuation, some agents might end up with more items than others. We need to ensure all agents get a fair chance, or at least have a reasonable allocation.

Let's check the assignment based on the highest valuation and adjust if necessary:
- Agent 0: No items
- Agent 1: [4] 
- Agent 2: [0, 5]
- Agent 3: [1, 2]
- Agent 4: [3]

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed based on the highest valuation.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0, 5],
    "3": [1, 2],
    "4": [3]
}
```
