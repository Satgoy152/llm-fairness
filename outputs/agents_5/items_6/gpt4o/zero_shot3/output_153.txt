Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 79.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80   0   4  69   7  39
1  28  69  79  31  94  20
2  50  47  51  55  97  69
3  19  77  71  64  86  17
4  17  12  17  70  60  61

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we can consider the valuations provided by each agent for the items. One approach is to use the "maximum total valuation" method, where we aim to allocate items such that the sum of valuations of all agents is maximized while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations for Each Item:** Assign each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Check for Conflicts:** If multiple agents value the same item equally, we need to resolve conflicts by considering their next best available item.

3. **Ensure Fairness:** Try to balance the allocations so that each agent gets a roughly equal number of items, if possible.

4. **Adjust for Empty Allocations:** Ensure no agent ends up with an empty allocation if possible.

From the given table, here's the allocation:

- Item 0: Valued highest by Agent 0 (80)
- Item 1: Valued highest by Agent 3 (77)
- Item 2: Valued highest by Agent 1 (79)
- Item 3: Valued highest by Agent 0 (69)
- Item 4: Valued highest by Agent 1 (94)
- Item 5: Valued highest by Agent 2 (69)

Now, let's allocate these items:

- Agent 0: Items [0, 3]
- Agent 1: Items [2, 4]
- Agent 2: Item [5]
- Agent 3: Item [1]
- Agent 4: No items

The allocations in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": []
}
```
