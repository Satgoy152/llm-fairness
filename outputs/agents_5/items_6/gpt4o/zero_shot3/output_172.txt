Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  22  85  54  50  82
1  21  18  28  96  87  73
2  37   8  41  31  13  32
3  58  20  17  34  51  63
4  86  77  97  72  27  53

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the 6 items among the 5 agents, we can use a method such as maximizing the total value for all agents while ensuring each agent gets at least one item. Here's one possible way to allocate the items:

1. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 2 (97), so we assign item 2 to agent 4.
2. Agent 1 has the highest valuation for item 3 (96), so we assign item 3 to agent 1.
3. Agent 0 has the highest valuation for item 5 (82), so we assign item 5 to agent 0.
4. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for item 0 (58), so we assign item 0 to agent 3.
5. Agent 4 also has the highest valuation for item 1 (77), but since agent 4 already has item 2, we can assign item 1 to the next highest valuation, which is agent 0 (22).
6. Agent 4 has the highest valuation for item 4 (27), but since agent 4 already has item 2, we assign item 4 to agent 1 (87).

After this allocation, the distribution of items is as follows:

- Agent 0: [1, 5]
- Agent 1: [3, 4]
- Agent 2: []
- Agent 3: [0]
- Agent 4: [2]

Here's the JSON representation of this allocation:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 5],
    "1": [3, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [2]
}
```
