Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 16.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  11   9  60  36  87  34
1  99  37  16  10  84  49
2  69  66  54  30  37  90
3  51  10  65  53  94  76
4  54  13  74  13  95  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we need to ensure that each agent receives an integer number of items, and all items are distributed. We will consider the valuations each agent has for the items to try to maximize overall satisfaction.

Let's follow these steps:

1. **Evaluate Total Valuations for Each Item Across All Agents**: This helps identify which items are most valuable overall and should be prioritized for distribution.
2. **Assign Each Item to the Agent Who Values It Most**: This can be a starting point for a fair allocation, where each item goes to the agent who values it most. This maximizes individual satisfaction.
3. **Adjust for Fairness**: If any agent ends up with more items than others, we may need to adjust to ensure a fair distribution of the total number of items.

### Step-by-Step Allocation:

1. **Item 0**: Highest value is 99 (Agent 1).
2. **Item 1**: Highest value is 66 (Agent 2).
3. **Item 2**: Highest value is 74 (Agent 4).
4. **Item 3**: Highest value is 53 (Agent 3).
5. **Item 4**: Highest value is 95 (Agent 4).
6. **Item 5**: Highest value is 99 (Agent 4).

After this first pass:
- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [3]
- Agent 4: [2, 4, 5]

Agent 4 has 3 items, while others have 0 or 1. To ensure a more balanced distribution:
- Re-evaluate items assigned to Agent 4 for redistribution.

Since Agent 4 has a notably higher value for items 4 and 5 compared to others, keep those with Agent 4, but consider redistributing item 2.
- Item 2's next highest value is 65 from Agent 3.

Revised allocation:
- Agent 0: []
- Agent 1: [0]
- Agent 2: [1]
- Agent 3: [2, 3]
- Agent 4: [4, 5]

This distribution ensures each agent has either 0 or 2 items, with Agent 4 having 2 items of high personal value.

Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [2, 3],
    "4": [4, 5]
}
```
