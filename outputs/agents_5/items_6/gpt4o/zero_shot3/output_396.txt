Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 23.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  79  18  67  17  39
1  66  10  23   0   6  58
2  94   2   3  55  35  21
3  71  60  26  76  10  86
4  95  24  10  63  19  11

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

 [66 10 23  0  6 58]
 [94  2  3 55 35 21]

 [95 24 10 63 19 11]]
Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we need to ensure that each agent receives items that maximize their total valuation while making sure all items are allocated and each agent can get zero or more items. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. Identify the highest valuation each agent has for any item.
2. Assign each agent an item with their highest individual valuation, if possible.
3. In case of conflicts (where multiple agents have the highest valuation for the same item), prioritize allocation by overall maximum valuation for remaining items.

Let's allocate the items:

- **Agent 0:** Highest valuations are 79 (Item 1) and 67 (Item 3). Assign Item 1 as it is the highest.
- **Agent 1:** Highest valuations are 66 (Item 0) and 58 (Item 5). Assign Item 0 as it is the highest.
- **Agent 2:** Highest valuation is 94 (Item 0), but it's already taken. Next highest is 55 (Item 3). Assign Item 3.
- **Agent 3:** Highest valuation is 86 (Item 5). Assign Item 5.
- **Agent 4:** Highest valuation is 95 (Item 0), but it's already taken. Next highest is 63 (Item 3), but it's also taken. Assign Item 4, which is the next highest available.

Now, let's summarize the allocations to make sure all items are assigned and each agent is considered:

- Item 0: Assigned to Agent 1
- Item 1: Assigned to Agent 0
- Item 2: Unallocated, assign to the agent with the least total valuation. Assign to Agent 4.
- Item 3: Assigned to Agent 2
- Item 4: Assigned to Agent 4
- Item 5: Assigned to Agent 3

Final Allocation:
```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [2, 4]
}
```

This allocation ensures all items are distributed, and each agent is considered based on their valuations.
