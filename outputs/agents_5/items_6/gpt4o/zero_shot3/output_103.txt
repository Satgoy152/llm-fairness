Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  80  28  58  10  60  24
1  72  74  21  73  69  91
2  84  27  67  28  77   9
3  66   3  88  87  44  15
4  84   3  16  66  36  65

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to distribute them in a way that maximizes the overall satisfaction or value for each agent. One potential approach to achieve a fair allocation is to use the method of maximum value matching, where we assign items to the agents who value them the most while ensuring that each agent gets at least one item if possible.

Here's a greedy approach to allocating the items:

1. Look at the highest valued items for each agent and assign items to agents who have the highest valuation for a specific item.
2. Ensure that each agent ends up with at least one item.

Let's analyze the given valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the most (80)
- Agent 1 values item 5 the most (91)
- Agent 2 values item 0 the most (84)
- Agent 3 values item 2 the most (88)
- Agent 4 values item 0 the most (84)

By following a fair and greedy allocation process, the allocation could be as follows:

1. Assign item 0 to Agent 2 (as they value it the highest among all agents valuing item 0).
2. Assign item 5 to Agent 1 (as they value it the highest).
3. Assign item 2 to Agent 3 (as they value it the highest).
4. Now, we have three items left: 1, 3, and 4.

For the remaining items, we can distribute them as follows:

5. Assign item 4 to Agent 0 (who values it 60, the highest among remaining unallocated items).
6. Assign item 3 to Agent 4 (who values it 66, the highest among remaining unallocated items).
7. Assign item 1 to Agent 0 (who values it 28).

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1, 4],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [3]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives at least one item, and all items are allocated.
