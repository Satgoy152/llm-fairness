Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 45.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  22  31  27  18  70  60
1  98  81  45  76   9  35
2  38  51  78  67  31  82
3  20   4  84   3  22  27
4  94  68  62  56  13  20

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the satisfaction of each agent by considering their valuations. Here's a step-by-step approach for this allocation:

1. **Identify High Valuations**: Look for the highest valuation by each agent to ensure each gets at least one item they highly value.
2. **Initial Allocation**: Assign items based on the highest available valuation per agent.
3. **Ensure All Items Are Allocated**: After initial assignment, ensure that all items are distributed, possibly adjusting allocations to balance overall fairness.

Let's analyze the given table:

| Agent | Item 0 | Item 1 | Item 2 | Item 3 | Item 4 | Item 5 |
|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0     | 22     | 31     | 27     | 18     | 70     | 60     |
| 1     | 98     | 81     | 45     | 76     | 9      | 35     |
| 2     | 38     | 51     | 78     | 67     | 31     | 82     |
| 3     | 20     | 4      | 84     | 3      | 22     | 27     |
| 4     | 94     | 68     | 62     | 56     | 13     | 20     |

### Allocation Strategy

- **Agent 0**: They value Item 4 the highest (70).
- **Agent 1**: They value Item 0 the highest (98).
- **Agent 2**: They value Item 5 the highest (82).
- **Agent 3**: They value Item 2 the highest (84).
- **Agent 4**: They value Item 0 the highest (94), but since Item 0 is already taken, their next highest is Item 1 (68).

Let's proceed with the allocations:

1. **Agent 0**: Assign Item 4.
2. **Agent 1**: Assign Item 0.
3. **Agent 2**: Assign Item 5.
4. **Agent 3**: Assign Item 2.
5. **Agent 4**: Assign Item 1.

Now, since all items are assigned, we need to ensure fairness in terms of quantity and value:

- Items 3 remains unallocated. Among the agents with the least allocated value, Agent 4 values Item 3 the highest (56).

Thus, the final allocation looks like this:

```json
{
    "0": [4],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [2],
    "4": [1, 3]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance both the quantity of items and the value each agent receives.
