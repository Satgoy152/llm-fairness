Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 37.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  51  35  24  59  90  22
1   3  27  37  99  92  86
2  15   0  69  13  90  32
3  23  92   3   2  86  55
4  55  25   4  20  96  81

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that ensures each agent receives at least one item and the total number of items allocated equals the number of items available. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we allocate items to the agent who values them the most, while ensuring each agent gets at least one item.

Let's go through this process step by step:

1. Start by identifying the highest value an agent assigns to any item. Allocate the item with the highest value to the corresponding agent.

2. Ensure each agent receives at least one item. If an agent hasn't received any item after the first step, allocate the next highest valued item to that agent.

3. Continue this process until all items are allocated, ensuring each agent receives at least one item.

Applying this method to the table:

- Allocate item 3 to agent 1 (value 99).
- Allocate item 4 to agent 0 (value 90).
- Allocate item 2 to agent 2 (value 69).
- Allocate item 1 to agent 3 (value 92).
- Allocate item 5 to agent 4 (value 81).
- Allocate item 0 to agent 0 (value 51) since agent 0 only has one item, and it has the next highest value.

This ensures each agent gets at least one item, and all items are allocated. Here's the final allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
