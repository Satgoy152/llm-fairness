Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 83.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  88  86  31  23  60  21
1  68  24  83  10  92  59
2  49  19  69  98  89  31
3  56  69  46  74  19  39
4  37  80  49  78  25  71

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we need to consider each agent's highest valued items and try to distribute the items such that each agent receives a reasonable share according to their preferences.

Here are the steps I've taken to achieve a fair allocation:

1. **Identify Highest Valuations:** For each agent, identify the items with the highest value.

2. **Allocate Items:** Distribute the items, ensuring each agent gets at least one item they highly value, if possible, and that all items are allocated.

3. **Ensure all Items are Allocated:** Make sure that all items are assigned to an agent, and no item is left unallocated.

Here's a fair allocation based on the provided table:

- Agent 0 highly values item 0.
- Agent 1 highly values item 4.
- Agent 2 highly values item 3.
- Agent 3 highly values item 1.
- Agent 4 highly values item 5.

Now, we distribute the remaining items to ensure all items are allocated:

- Agent 0: Items 0, 2
- Agent 1: Item 4
- Agent 2: Item 3
- Agent 3: Items 1
- Agent 4: Item 5

This allocation ensures each agent gets items they value, and all items are allocated.

{
    "0": [0, 2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```
