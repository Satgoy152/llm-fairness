Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 42.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  72  64  70  67  82  71
1  93  21  42  87  21  59
2  55  71   5  91  18  54
3  20  65  14  22  91  12
4  96   1  69  58  59  67

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents based on their valuations, we can use a method that seeks to maximize the total valuation for each agent while ensuring each agent receives at least one item. One approach is to use a greedy algorithm that assigns items to the agents who value them the most. Here's a step-by-step allocation process:

1. **Assign Items by Highest Valuation**: Start by assigning each item to the agent who values it the most.

2. **Ensure Each Agent Gets At Least One Item**: If any agent does not receive an item through this process, reallocate to ensure every agent has at least one item.

Let's go through the allocation:

- Item 0: Highest value is 96 (Agent 4).
- Item 1: Highest value is 71 (Agent 2).
- Item 2: Highest value is 70 (Agent 0).
- Item 3: Highest value is 91 (Agent 2).
- Item 4: Highest value is 91 (Agent 3).
- Item 5: Highest value is 71 (Agent 0).

After this initial round of allocation, we have:

- Agent 0: [2, 5]
- Agent 1: []
- Agent 2: [1, 3]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [0]

Agent 1 does not have any items, so we need to make adjustments:

- Reassign item 5 from Agent 0 to Agent 1 to ensure every agent receives at least one item.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: [2]
- Agent 1: [5]
- Agent 2: [1, 3]
- Agent 3: [4]
- Agent 4: [0]

This ensures each agent has at least one item, and all items are allocated.

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [1, 3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0]
}
```
