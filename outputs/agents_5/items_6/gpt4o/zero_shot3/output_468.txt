Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 73.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  77  62  60  71  32
1  59  42  73  47  93  65
2   6  18  35  13  44  40
3  95  98  22  55  58  86
4  96  13  59  14  31  83

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents while considering their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the overall satisfaction of all agents. The goal is to distribute the items such that each agent gets a fair share based on their preferences.

One approach is to use a greedy algorithm where we assign each item to the agent who values it the most, ensuring each agent receives at least one item if possible. However, since there are only 6 items and 5 agents, one agent will receive 2 items, or some agents may not receive any items. Let's start assigning:

1. Assign each item to the agent with the highest valuation for that item. 
2. Ensure that each agent gets at least one item if possible.
3. Adjust as necessary to ensure all items are allocated.

Given the matrix:

```
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  85  77  62  60  71  32
1  59  42  73  47  93  65
2   6  18  35  13  44  40
3  95  98  22  55  58  86
4  96  13  59  14  31  83
```

We can determine the allocation as follows:

- Item 0: Agent 4 values it the most at 96.
- Item 1: Agent 3 values it the most at 98.
- Item 2: Agent 1 values it the most at 73.
- Item 3: Agent 0 values it the most at 60.
- Item 4: Agent 1 values it the most at 93 (Agent 3 has a close valuation but already has item 1).
- Item 5: Agent 3 values it the most at 86 (Agent 1 has a close valuation but already has items 2 and 4).

After ensuring each agent gets at least one item and adjusting as needed, the allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [],
    "3": [1, 5],
    "4": [0]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed, and each agent who has a high valuation for an item generally receives it, while also attempting to balance the distribution. Agent 2 receives no items under this setup, as their valuations are generally lower compared to the others.
