Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 21.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  39   1   4  42  66  12
1  65  13  21  31  18  99
2  58  58  68  41  12  86
3  79  87  77  54  91  59
4  74  97  35  86  71  16

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets at least one item, if possible, and no agent gets more than one item more than any other agent. 

Let's use a greedy approach to assign items based on the highest value each agent assigns to an available item.

Here's a possible allocation:

1. Agent 3 has the highest valuation for any item, valuing item 4 at 91. Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
2. Agent 4 values item 1 the highest at 97. Assign item 1 to Agent 4.
3. Agent 1 values item 5 the highest at 99. Assign item 5 to Agent 1.
4. Agent 3 values item 0 at 79, and it is not yet allocated. Assign item 0 to Agent 3.
5. Agent 2 values item 2 the highest at 68. Assign item 2 to Agent 2.
6. Finally, Agent 0 values item 3 the highest at 42. Assign item 3 to Agent 0.

This allocation ensures that all items are distributed among the agents, and each agent receives a fair share based on their preferences.

The allocation in JSON format is as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [5],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [0, 4],
    "4": [1]
}
```
