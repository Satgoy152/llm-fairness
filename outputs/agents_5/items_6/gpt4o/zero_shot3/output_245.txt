Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 63.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  75  32  59  18  91  14
1  77  74  63  83  21  92
2  60  39  93  13  62  48
3  24  81  32  75  47  32
4   8  75  34  42  19  99

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we should aim to maximize the total valuation each agent receives while ensuring each agent gets an integer number of items. One approach is to allocate items to the agent that values them the most. Here's a possible allocation based on this criterion:

1. **Item 0**: Agent 0 values it the most at 75.
2. **Item 1**: Agent 3 values it the most at 81.
3. **Item 2**: Agent 2 values it the most at 93.
4. **Item 3**: Agent 1 values it the most at 83.
5. **Item 4**: Agent 0 values it the most at 91.
6. **Item 5**: Agent 4 values it the most at 99.

This allocation ensures each item is given to the agent who values it most, resulting in a fair distribution based on individual valuations. Now, let's represent this allocation in the specified JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation assigns all six items and ensures that each item is given to the agent who values it the most, while also ensuring that each agent gets an integer number of items.
