Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 6.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  78  81  98  53  35  64
1  44  34   6  59  67  29
2   8  14  46  17  30  81
3  31  83  56   1   2  41
4  98  59  12  89  68   6

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items to the agents based on their valuations, we can use a strategy that aims to maximize the total valuation each agent receives, while ensuring each item is allocated to exactly one agent. Here's one possible allocation that aims to achieve this:

1. Assign items to agents based on the highest valuation for each item:

   - Item 0: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (98).
   - Item 1: Agent 3 has the highest valuation (83).
   - Item 2: Agent 0 has the highest valuation (98).
   - Item 3: Agent 4 has the highest valuation (89).
   - Item 4: Agent 1 has the highest valuation (67).
   - Item 5: Agent 2 has the highest valuation (81).

Following this approach, we can allocate items as follows:

- Agent 0 gets item 2.
- Agent 1 gets item 4.
- Agent 2 gets item 5.
- Agent 3 gets item 1.
- Agent 4 gets items 0 and 3.

The final JSON allocation is:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [1],
    "4": [0, 3]
}
```
