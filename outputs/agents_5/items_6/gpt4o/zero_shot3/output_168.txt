Input:

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 56.

    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  20   9  96  87  60  41
1  14  97  56   8  59  10
2  58  75  78  41  57   1
3  72  10  68   3  33  93
4  93  34  77   3  22  90

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.

    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last think you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to distribute the items such that the total valuation for each agent is as balanced as possible. This requires examining the valuation table and distributing the items to maximize fairness among the agents.

Here's one approach to allocate the items fairly:

1. Calculate the total valuation each agent has for all items.
2. Allocate items to agents such that each gets items with high valuations, ensuring the distribution is as fair as possible.

From the table:

- Agent 0: Total valuation = 20 + 9 + 96 + 87 + 60 + 41 = 313
- Agent 1: Total valuation = 14 + 97 + 56 + 8 + 59 + 10 = 244
- Agent 2: Total valuation = 58 + 75 + 78 + 41 + 57 + 1 = 310
- Agent 3: Total valuation = 72 + 10 + 68 + 3 + 33 + 93 = 279
- Agent 4: Total valuation = 93 + 34 + 77 + 3 + 22 + 90 = 319

To allocate the items:

- Agent 0: Allocate item 2 (value 96)
- Agent 1: Allocate item 1 (value 97)
- Agent 2: Allocate item 0 (value 58)
- Agent 3: Allocate item 5 (value 93)
- Agent 4: Allocate items 3 and 4 (value 3 and 22)

With this allocation, we ensure each agent gets items while trying to keep the total values they receive balanced.

The allocations in the requested JSON format are:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```
