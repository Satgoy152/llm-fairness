Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 76.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  48  24   1  86  68  81
1  68  57  76  14   9   5
2  39  65   5  96  85  29
3  45  55   2  97  37  45
4  13  73  57  19  48   3

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we aim to achieve an envy-free allocation where each agent receives a bundle of items that they value highly, relative to what they would get by swapping with any other agent. Given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one agent will receive two items, while the others will receive one item each.

Let's analyze the data and try to allocate the items:

1. **Agent 0**: Values item 3 the most (86).
2. **Agent 1**: Values item 2 the most (76).
3. **Agent 2**: Values item 3 the most (96) but item 4 second most (85).
4. **Agent 3**: Values item 3 the most (97) but item 1 second most (55).
5. **Agent 4**: Values item 1 the most (73).

Given these preferences, we need to balance the allocations to minimize envy. Let's try to allocate based on maximizing each agent's satisfaction while ensuring everyone gets at least one item.

- **Agent 0** gets item 0 (48) and item 5 (81) for a total value of 129.
- **Agent 1** gets item 2 (76).
- **Agent 2** gets item 4 (85).
- **Agent 3** gets item 3 (97).
- **Agent 4** gets item 1 (73).

This allocation gives each agent a high-valued item according to their preferences and ensures that the total number of items allocated is 6.

Here is the allocation in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 5],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
