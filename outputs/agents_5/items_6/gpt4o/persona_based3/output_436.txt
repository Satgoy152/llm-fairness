Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 68.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   0  68  82  52  64  51
1  66  94  68  50  75   6
2  94   5  64  59  81  12
3  55  22  81  81  19  21
4  79  98  87  10  55  26

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents, we will employ a method that aims to achieve envy-freeness, where no agent would prefer the bundle of another agent over their own, given their valuations. Since there are 5 agents and 6 items, some agents will receive more than one item.

To begin, let's consider the valuations matrix:

```
Valuations:
Agent 0: [0, 68, 82, 52, 64, 51]
Agent 1: [66, 94, 68, 50, 75, 6]
Agent 2: [94, 5, 64, 59, 81, 12]
Agent 3: [55, 22, 81, 81, 19, 21]
Agent 4: [79, 98, 87, 10, 55, 26]
```

A potential method to achieve a fair division is to ensure that each agent receives an item (or items) that maximizes their utility while minimizing envy. We can follow a round-robin approach or prioritize initial allocations based on highest individual item valuations.

Let's create an allocation that aims to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 4** should receive item 1, as they value it the highest at 98.
2. **Agent 0** should receive item 2, as they value it the highest at 82.
3. **Agent 3** should receive item 3, as they value it the highest at 81.
4. **Agent 1** should receive item 4, as they value it the highest at 75.
5. **Agent 2** should receive item 0, as they value it the highest at 94.
6. The remaining item, item 5, can be allocated to **Agent 0** as they have a relatively high valuation of 51, and this will give them two items, balancing the number of items per agent.

This allocation ensures each agent receives items they highly value, aiming to minimize envy.

The final allocation in the requested JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [2, 5],
    "1": [4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [1]
}
```
