Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 70.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  40  12  59  66  35  98
1  43  21  70  94  81  24
2  38  36  66  66  25  75
3  13  86  23  21  95  48
4  67  57  41  30  37  91

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while considering the agents' valuations and aiming for envy-freeness, let's proceed with the allocation in a way that minimizes envy. We'll look for a balance in terms of agents' preferences and try to ensure a fair distribution of items.

Given the valuations:

```
Agent 0: [40, 12, 59, 66, 35, 98]
Agent 1: [43, 21, 70, 94, 81, 24]
Agent 2: [38, 36, 66, 66, 25, 75]
Agent 3: [13, 86, 23, 21, 95, 48]
Agent 4: [67, 57, 41, 30, 37, 91]
```

We aim to allocate each item in a way that each agent receives an integer number of items and the total number of items allocated remains 6.

Here is one potential allocation that considers these constraints and tries to balance the valuations:

1. **Agent 0**: Allocated item 5 (value 98).
2. **Agent 1**: Allocated item 3 (value 94).
3. **Agent 2**: Allocated item 2 (value 66).
4. **Agent 3**: Allocated item 4 (value 95).
5. **Agent 4**: Allocated items 0 and 1 (values 67 and 57).

This allocation attempts to distribute the items such that each agent receives items they value highly, reducing potential envy among agents.

The allocation in JSON format is:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [2],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [0, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that all 6 items are allocated, and each agent receives a fair share based on their valuations.
