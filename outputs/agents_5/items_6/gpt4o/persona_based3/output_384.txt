Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 12.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  61  22  25  29  30  18
1  20  97  12  79  43  36
2  45  63  16  87  29  33
3  23  13  36  23  51  26
4  94  37  10  92  66  84

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair division of the items among the agents, we will consider maximizing the total value each agent receives while ensuring no agent envies another. One approach is to use the concept of envy-freeness, where each agent should feel they received the best possible allocation given their valuation.

Let's start by examining the table of valuations:

```
Agent\Item |  0   1   2   3   4   5
------------------------------------
    0      | 61  22  25  29  30  18
    1      | 20  97  12  79  43  36
    2      | 45  63  16  87  29  33
    3      | 23  13  36  23  51  26
    4      | 94  37  10  92  66  84
```

To avoid envy, we aim to assign items such that each agent's total valuation is maximized for the items they receive compared to items other agents receive. Here's a possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0**: Highly values item 0.
2. **Agent 1**: Highly values item 1.
3. **Agent 2**: Highly values item 3.
4. **Agent 3**: Highly values item 4.
5. **Agent 4**: Highly values items 0, 3, 5 (but items 0 and 3 are already assigned to others, so we choose item 5).

Considering the above observations, let's allocate the items:

- Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
- Assign item 1 to Agent 1.
- Assign item 3 to Agent 2.
- Assign item 4 to Agent 3.
- Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we have items 2 remaining, which can be allocated to Agent 4 as itâ€™s the only item left and they still maximize their valuation compared to the rest. 

Here's the allocation in JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [1],
    "2": [3],
    "3": [4],
    "4": [2, 5]
}
```

This allocation ensures each agent receives an item they highly value, and the total number of items allocated is 6, with each agent getting at least one item to maximize fairness and reduce envy.
