Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 78.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  59   5  74  58  67  88
1  84   4  78  90  67  43
2   5  83  11  55  42  70
3  85  80  29  24  14  11
4  83  60  63  75  60  68

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Valuation Table:

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents such that the envy among agents is minimized, we can use the concept of maximizing the sum of valuations for each agent while ensuring that each agent receives at least one item. However, given that there are 5 agents and 6 items, one of the agents will receive 2 items.

Let's proceed with an allocation strategy that aims to maximize individual satisfaction:

1. **Agent 0**: Highest valuation is for item 5 (value: 88).
2. **Agent 1**: Highest valuation is for item 3 (value: 90).
3. **Agent 2**: Highest valuation is for item 1 (value: 83).
4. **Agent 3**: Highest valuation is for item 0 (value: 85).
5. **Agent 4**: Highest valuation is for item 4 (value: 60).

Now, we have only item 2 left. The agent with the highest dissatisfaction (lowest total valuation) should receive this item to minimize envy.

Initially, after the first allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5 (value: 88)
- Agent 1: Item 3 (value: 90)
- Agent 2: Item 1 (value: 83)
- Agent 3: Item 0 (value: 85)
- Agent 4: Item 4 (value: 60)

The remaining item is 2. We will assign it to the agent with the lowest total valuation so far:

- Agent 4: Currently has a total value of 60. Adding item 2 (value: 63) gives a new total of 123.

Final allocation:

- Agent 0: Item 5
- Agent 1: Item 3
- Agent 2: Item 1
- Agent 3: Item 0
- Agent 4: Items 4, 2

Now, let's present the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [5],
    "1": [3],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [4, 2]
}
```

This allocation seeks to balance the interests of all agents by considering their highest valuations and ensuring that each receives at least one item, with one agent receiving two due to the surplus. This approach helps to minimize potential envy among agents.
