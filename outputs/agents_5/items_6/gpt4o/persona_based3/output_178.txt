Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 99.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0   7  62  77  35  13  51
1  37  43  99  66  54  42
2  24  73  84  32  31  17
3  78   2   2  61  54  20
4  40  45  80  81  91   4

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we will aim to minimize envy by examining the valuation table and trying to distribute the items such that each agent receives a bundle they value highly. We will attempt to ensure that each agent's allocation is as equitable as possible.

Let's start by examining the preferences and values each agent has for the items:

- **Agent 0**: Highly values item 2 (77) and item 1 (62).
- **Agent 1**: Highly values item 2 (99), item 3 (66), and item 4 (54).
- **Agent 2**: Highly values item 2 (84) and item 1 (73).
- **Agent 3**: Highly values item 0 (78) and item 3 (61).
- **Agent 4**: Highly values item 4 (91), item 3 (81), and item 2 (80).

With these preferences in mind, we will try to allocate the items to minimize envy:

1. **Agent 0**: Let's give them item 1, which they value second highest (62).
2. **Agent 1**: Since they value item 2 highly (99), let's allocate item 2 to them.
3. **Agent 2**: Let's give them item 5, which is not highly valued by others and has a moderate value to Agent 2 (17).
4. **Agent 3**: We can allocate item 0 to them, which they value the highest (78).
5. **Agent 4**: We can give them items 3 and 4, which they value highly (81 and 91, respectively).

This distribution aims to give each agent an item they value relatively highly while ensuring all items are allocated.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [1],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [5],
    "3": [0],
    "4": [3, 4]
}
```

This allocation uses all 6 items and tries to balance the valuations each agent has for their allocated items.
