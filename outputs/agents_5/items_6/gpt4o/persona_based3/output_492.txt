Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 84.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  94  52  28   8  79  27
1  27  51  84   9  37  45
2  44  71  41   6  57  18
3  34  94  84  71  28  73
4  34  49  59  30  23  87

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness as much as possible, we need to consider each agent's valuation of the items and aim for a balanced distribution based on these valuations. Here is one possible allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 0** has high valuations for items 0 and 4. Assign item 0 to Agent 0.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 highly. Assign item 2 to Agent 1.
3. **Agent 2** values item 1 highly. Assign item 1 to Agent 2.
4. **Agent 3** values item 3 highly. Assign item 3 to Agent 3.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 highly. Assign item 5 to Agent 4.

Now, we have one item left unallocated (item 4). We should assign it based on maximizing the total valuation or minimizing envy:

- Agent 0 values item 4 quite highly (79), which is more than any other unallocated item for other agents. Assign item 4 to Agent 0.

Here's the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0, 4],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [1],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent gets at least one item, and the distribution attempts to respect the agents' preferences to a large extent while ensuring that all items are allocated.
