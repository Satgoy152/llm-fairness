Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 28.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  74  42  92  48   3  40
1  78  52  28  52  59  51
2  29  97  98  47  56  83
3  79  48  28   6  32   8
4   3  13  56  99  75   8

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To achieve a fair allocation that minimizes envy among agents, we need to consider the valuations each agent has for the items and aim to distribute the items in a way that maximizes their perceived value while distributing them fairly.

### Step 1: Understand the Valuations

The given valuation matrix is as follows:

```
        0   1   2   3   4   5
    0  74  42  92  48   3  40
    1  78  52  28  52  59  51
    2  29  97  98  47  56  83
    3  79  48  28   6  32   8
    4   3  13  56  99  75   8
```

### Step 2: Determine Possible Allocations

We aim to allocate the items to agents such that each agent receives the items they value highly while ensuring no agent feels envious of another.

### Step 3: Allocate the Items

Given the valuations, a potential allocation can be derived by considering the highest valued items for each agent and ensuring each item is allocated only once:

1. **Agent 0:** Values item 2 the most, so assign item 2.
2. **Agent 1:** Values item 0 the most, so assign item 0.
3. **Agent 2:** Values item 2 the most, but since item 2 is already allocated, assign the next highest, item 1.
4. **Agent 3:** Values item 0 the most, but since item 0 is already allocated, assign the next highest, item 3.
5. **Agent 4:** Values item 3 the most, but since item 3 is already allocated, assign the next highest, item 4.

With these allocations, we have assigned items 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4, leaving item 5 to be assigned to the agent who would gain the most remaining value. This could be Agent 2, who values item 5 highly after item 1.

### Step 4: Finalize the Allocation

Based on the above considerations, the allocations are as follows:

```json
{
    "0": [2],
    "1": [0],
    "2": [1, 5],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [4]
}
```

This allocation attempts to balance the distribution of items according to each agent's highest preferences and ensures that all items are allocated fairly.
