Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 94.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  56  41  95  99  55  14
1  32  90  94  84  43  63
2  89  82  44  32  18   4
3  15  23  81  24  14  63
4  64  82  74  15  65  93

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents with the goal of envy-freeness, we will consider each agent's valuations and try to balance their perceived value of the items they receive. We aim to give each agent a subset of items such that no agent feels another has a better allocation than their own, based on their personal valuations.

Considering the given valuations, one method is to use a round-robin algorithm, where each agent picks their most valued item that is still available, in turns, until all items are allocated. This doesn't guarantee envy-freeness, but it often gives a reasonably fair division.

### Step-by-step Allocation:

1. **Agent 0** values item 3 the most (99), so they receive item 3.
2. **Agent 1** values item 2 the most (94), so they receive item 2.
3. **Agent 2** values item 0 the most (89), so they receive item 0.
4. **Agent 3** values item 2 the most, but it's taken. Their next highest is item 5 (63), so they receive item 5.
5. **Agent 4** values item 5 the most, but it's taken. Their next highest is item 1 (82), so they receive item 1.

This leaves item 4 unallocated. We will allocate it to the agent who would value it the most among the remaining agents:

6. **Agent 1** values item 4 the highest among the remaining agents (43), so they receive item 4.

### Final Allocation:

- **Agent 0**: [3]
- **Agent 1**: [2, 4]
- **Agent 2**: [0]
- **Agent 3**: [5]
- **Agent 4**: [1]

This allocation attempts to minimize envy by prioritizing agents' highest valued items first and ensuring all items are distributed.

{
    "0": [3],
    "1": [2, 4],
    "2": [0],
    "3": [5],
    "4": [1]
}
```
