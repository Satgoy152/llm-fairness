Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 98.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  98   8  80  58  40  86
1  93  82  98  48  75   3
2  30  59  49  38  99  73
3  35  31  32  63  11   4
4  95  32  88  62  12  94

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To allocate the items fairly among the agents, we consider the concept of envy-freeness. An allocation is envy-free if no agent prefers someone else's allocation over their own. Given the valuations, we aim to distribute the items so that each agent is satisfied with their bundle or does not envy another agent's bundle.

Let's analyze the valuations:

- Agent 0 values item 0 the highest (98) and also values item 5 relatively high (86).
- Agent 1 values item 2 the highest (98) and item 0 second highest (93).
- Agent 2 values item 4 the highest (99) and item 5 second highest (73).
- Agent 3 values item 3 the highest (63).
- Agent 4 values item 0 the highest (95) and item 5 second highest (94).

To achieve an envy-free distribution, we should try to allocate each agent one of their most valued items.

Here's a step-by-step allocation strategy:

1. **Agent 2** gets item 4 (value 99), their highest valuation.
2. **Agent 1** gets item 2 (value 98), their highest valuation.
3. **Agent 4** gets item 5 (value 94), their second-highest valuation.
4. **Agent 3** gets item 3 (value 63), their highest valuation.
5. **Agent 0** gets item 0 (value 98), their highest valuation.
6. **Agent 4** also gets item 1 (value 32), since they have a relatively lower total value from item 5 compared to other agents.

By this allocation, each agent receives at least one item they value highly, minimizing envy.

Here is the allocation in the required JSON format:

```json
{
    "0": [0],
    "1": [2],
    "2": [4],
    "3": [3],
    "4": [5, 1]
}
```

This allocation ensures that each agent receives items in a manner that is as envy-free as possible given the constraints.
