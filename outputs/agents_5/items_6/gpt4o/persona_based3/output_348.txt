Input:

        You are a computational economist with deep expertise in fair division and envy-freeness.

        The following table represents the valuations of 5 agents numbered 0,1,2, and so on for 6 items numbered 0,1,2, and so on. For example, the value agent 1 has of item 2 is 20.
    0   1   2   3   4   5
0  65  82   3  11  43  40
1  35  32  20  31  23  18
2   3  31  46  34  50   8
3  65  76  15  30  58  49
4  61  78  98  14  85  25

    Fairly allocate all the items to the agents so that each agent gets an integer number of items.  Only give allocations for agents and items in the table above.
    
    Present your allocations at the end in the following json format:
    {
        "0": [0,1,2,...],
        "1": [3,4,...],
        "2": [5,6,...],
        "3": [7,8,...],
        "4": [9,10,...]
    }

    Where the keys are the agent numbers and the values are lists of the items allocated to that agent.
    Even if an agent is assigned no items, include them in the json with an empty list.
    Make sure only and atleast 6 items are allocated in total.
    The last thing you give should be the allocations.

Output:
To fairly allocate the items among the agents while ensuring envy-freeness and other fairness criteria, we can use the Max-Min Fairness approach. This approach aims to maximize the minimum value that any agent receives. The challenge is to distribute the items such that each agent's total value is as balanced as possible, given their individual valuations.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the allocations:

1. **Calculate total value per agent**: This helps us understand how much each agent values all items combined.
   - Agent 0: 244
   - Agent 1: 159
   - Agent 2: 172
   - Agent 3: 293
   - Agent 4: 361

2. **Assign items to agents to maximize fairness**: We allocate items such that each agent gets at least one item, and we try to balance the total value as much as possible.

3. **Item assignments**:
   - Assign item 2 to Agent 4 because they value it the most at 98.
   - Assign item 0 to Agent 0 because they have a high valuation of 65.
   - Assign item 4 to Agent 3 as they value it at 58.
   - Assign item 3 to Agent 1 as they value it at 31.
   - Assign item 5 to Agent 2 as they value it at 8, which is not as high as others, but it ensures everyone gets something.
   - Assign item 1 to Agent 0, as they value it at 82, ensuring they get two items to balance the total values.

4. **Final allocations**:
   - Agent 0: Items 0, 1
   - Agent 1: Item 3
   - Agent 2: Item 5
   - Agent 3: Item 4
   - Agent 4: Item 2

These allocations attempt to balance each agent's total valuation, given their preferences.

    "3": [4],
